###chapter 1: Help

********
Christina Cavendish died in flames after murdering her husband’s mistress—a final act of rage over their daughter’s death. Reborn five years earlier, she awakens on the night she was falsely accused of seducing her powerful uncle-in-law, William. This time, she shreds the script: exposing the real schemer, cutting ties with the toxic dynasty, and reclaiming her stolen designs. But William’s obsession deepens as she defies him, and her enemies plot in shadows. With her daughter’s memory as her sword, Christina will burn their gilded world to ashes… or die trying.
********

"Please, save my daughter, please!"

In the hospital corridor, Harper Cavendish, who had just managed to escape from the kidnappers, collapsed to her knees upon hearing the news of her daughter's death. She cried out hoarsely, bowing her head to the doctors.

"She's so young, please save her, save her."

The medical staff present were moved by her grief, their eyes turning red.

The attending doctor choked up as he reached out to help her, hesitating, "Please get up first. Harper's post-surgery infection and complications were too severe. We really did our best!"

In fact, if it had only been an infection, timely treatment could have saved Harper.

But the hospital had contacted Harper's father several times, only to be told that they were scammers, collaborating with Harper's mother in a charade, and he refused to come to the hospital to sign the consent forms.

Harper's mother had also been unreachable, ultimately missing the best time for rescue!

However, seeing Harper's mother in such a state, it seemed she had also narrowly escaped death and suffered greatly.

Christina, kneeling on the ground, suddenly raised her head, revealing a bruised and swollen face to everyone.

She stared fixedly at the doctor, "My daughter has always been healthy. What kind of surgery did she undergo to result in an infection?"

"You don't know? Harper underwent a kidney donation surgery!" The doctor was somewhat surprised. Did she really not know?

Seeing Christina's grief, the doctor couldn't help but sigh, "I'm really sorry. Please take care of yourself and don't be overly sad. Harper was trying to save someone; she was a little hero. You should quickly take Harper to the funeral home for cremation and let the child be buried."

Hearing this, Christina's eyelashes trembled, "May I ask who signed the surgery consent form?"

"It was the child's father!"

Christina's frail body swayed, almost collapsing!

It was really him, it was really him!

Her nails dug into her palms, her eyes filled with hatred.

Christina wiped her tears fiercely, got up from the ground, and picked up her daughter's small body.

The doctor didn't know how to comfort this desperate woman and could only say dryly, "The child saved by Harper's kidney will surely live well with her share of life. This can be considered another way Harper lives on in your memory."

Christina gave a sorrowful smile, "The one who took my daughter's kidney and caused her death is my husband's illegitimate child. Do you think I can consider him a memory?"

The doctor was momentarily speechless!

He had thought the child's father was being noble by allowing such a young child to donate a kidney, but it turned out it was to save his own illegitimate child.

Christina ignored the doctor's complex expression, her tear-streaked face pressed against her daughter's cold little face, "Harper, don't be afraid. Mommy will join you soon!"

"After Mommy makes everyone who caused your death pay, Mommy will join you!"

"In the next life, you must come back as Mommy's daughter again, but we'll choose a different daddy!"

At the funeral home, Harper's small body lay on a stretcher, being carried towards the crematorium.

She was very thin, the white cloth covering her body barely showing any contours.

Beside her, Christina wore a black long dress, her long hair covering most of her bruised and swollen face.

Her eyes, filled with despair and emptiness, were fixed on her daughter's small body, her bony hand tightly holding her daughter's small hand.

She recalled Harper asking her more than once, "Mommy, why does Daddy only hold Jennifer Spencer and Mike Spencer's hands but never holds mine and Mommy's?"

"Is it because I'm a girl and Mike is a boy?"

"I'm sorry, Mommy. It's all because of me. If I were a boy, Daddy would like me a little more and like Mommy more too."

Jennifer, mentioned by Harper, was William Cavendish's first love.

Five years ago, due to an accident, Christina and William had a sexual relationship. Later, when she found out she was pregnant, William had no choice but to marry her.

At that time, Jennifer, who was engaged to William, left the country in anger, and William hated Christina deeply for it!

So, five years later, when Jennifer returned with Mike, who was born prematurely and had kidney problems, crying and asking William for help, stubbornly and resolutely saying that if it weren't for the child's severe illness, she would never have returned to disturb him and Christina, William almost wanted to kill Christina!

Since then, William never looked at Christina properly again and never showed Harper a kind face.

He gave all his tenderness and time to Jennifer and their son, desperately searching for a kidney donor for Mike.

Whenever Harper tried to get close to William, he would sternly reprimand her.

She still remembered that not long ago, on William's birthday, Harper had made a small cake by herself, hoping to share it with him, but William didn't come home until late at night.

The next day, when he returned, Harper, full of hope, brought the cake to him, only for him to knock it to the ground.

Christina heard Harper's heart-wrenching cries and rushed in, only to be grabbed by the neck and pinned against the wall by William.

William's eyes were bloodshot, looking at her as if she were an enemy.

His voice was fierce and sinister, "Christina, you harmed Jennifer. I want you to pay with your lives!"

Now, he had succeeded.

Her daughter, so considerate and obedient, willing to donate her kidney just to gain a bit of William's love, had been killed by William and Jennifer!

Christina's eyes were dry, no more tears left to shed, only emptiness in her eyes and her daughter's stiff body before her.

Finally, Harper was sent into the crematorium and placed in a small urn.

Holding Harper's ashes, Christina walked out of the funeral home into the pouring rain.

A funeral home staff member, feeling sorry for her, brought her an umbrella.

Christina didn't even look at it, walked to the roadside, got into a car, carefully placed Harper's ashes beside her, and then picked up her phone to make a call.

"Find out where Jennifer and her son are."

After hanging up, Christina looked at Harper's ashes on the passenger seat, her eyes gradually filling with madness.

She reached out, gently stroking the urn, "Harper, be good, wait a little longer for Mommy. Soon, Mommy will join you!"

Her phone rang with a message.

Seeing it, Christina immediately started the car.

Her poor daughter had died from post-surgery infection, while William was happily riding the carousel with Jennifer and her son at the amusement park!

When Harper was alive, she had begged her father more than once to take her to the amusement park.

How dare they? How could they?

Christina floored the gas pedal, the car shooting out like an arrow in the rain.

Soon, she arrived at the amusement park and saw from a distance Jennifer holding an umbrella and Mike's hand, waiting by the roadside.

Her eyes filled with hatred, Christina didn't hesitate, flooring the gas pedal and driving straight at them!

It was all because of Jennifer!

Jennifer had drugged William, taken the Cavendish family's money to leave the country, and upon returning, clung to William, slandering and harming her.

Now, Jennifer had caused her daughter's death.

Why should Jennifer, after committing so many evil deeds, still live well?

Jennifer watched in horror as a car sped towards her, seeing Christina's twisted, ferocious face through the windshield!

"Ah!" Jennifer screamed in terror, pulling her son to try to dodge.

But Christina's car was too fast!

Unable to dodge in time, Jennifer and Mike were hit and thrown into the air, landing heavily.

Seeing the two lying in a pool of blood, Christina showed a relieved yet crazed smile.

Then, without stopping, she immediately turned the car around.

Having punished those who caused her daughter's death, it was time for her to join her daughter.

As for William, didn't he care most about Jennifer and that child?

Then she would let him live, live to endure the pain of losing them!

As she drove away, she saw a black Bentley speeding towards Jennifer.

In the moment they passed, she saw William's panicked face in the driver's seat.

William saw her too.

Christina gave him a provocative smile.

Returning to the house she and William had lived in after their marriage, Christina gathered all of Harper's favorite things.

If she brought these to Harper, Harper would surely be happy.

After finishing, Christina cut the gas line and then lit a lighter!

Boom!

As the villa exploded, Christina looked out the window, seemingly seeing William, who had just gotten out of the car, frantically trying to rush in.

Was he here to settle accounts with her?

Too bad, he would never have the chance again.

Harper, slow down, wait for Mommy, Mommy is coming to find you!

###chapter 2 Rebirth

"Tell me, did you drug William? It's bad enough you drugged him and had sex with him, but you made sure everyone knew about it?"

The cane struck her back heavily, jolting Christina awake.

She opened her eyes, and the familiar surroundings made her pupils contract.

The Cavendish Mansion's living room?

Hadn't she died in the house she lived in with William after their marriage?

The memory of the explosion tearing her body apart, the searing pain of the flames, was still vivid. Why was she here?

Before she could react, mocking and sarcastic voices around her started up one after another.

"If it wasn't her, who else could it be? She finally transformed from a Cinderella to a socialite, lived a few years of a worry-free life, and couldn't bear to go back to her old poor days. Naturally, she had to find a powerful man to cling to before being kicked out! She even wrote a novel about unrequited love based on herself. What decent girl doesn't focus on studying but only thinks about men?"

"Like mother, like daughter. After all, she's not one of us Cavendish family members; she's different from our children."

"Her seduction tactics are just like her mother's. No wonder they're mother and daughter. If you ask me, Elisa Stewart, you might as well start a training class. I'm sure many people like you and your daughter, who dream of rising to the top, would pay to learn from you."

The mentioned Elisa was Christina's mother.

At this moment, she didn't even dare to sit but knelt beside Christina, head lowered, face pale, lips bitten until they bled, not daring to say a word.

Because in this house, they had no right to speak!

Christina blinked, looking at the disdainful and disgusted faces around her, at her mother's enduring and humiliated appearance, feeling a bit dazed.

This seemed to be the time when William was drugged, accidentally had sex with her, and the incident was exposed, leading to the Cavendish family interrogating her!

Thinking of this, Christina quickly glanced at the central position.

Sure enough, there sat the grim-faced Nicholas Cavendish and the cold, unapproachable William.

In an instant, Christina's heart felt like it was thrown into a boiling pot.

She had been reborn!

She had actually been reborn!

Reborn to the time when she had sex with William and was being interrogated!

In her previous life, facing the Cavendish family's tough stance and her own secret, unspoken fantasies about William, she admitted that the person who had sex with William was indeed her.

As a result, the Cavendish family was furious. Nicholas punished her by making her kneel on the gravel path in the Cavendish family garden for three days until she fainted from the rain and was found to be pregnant. The Cavendish family had no choice but to let William marry her.

From then on, Christina's position in the Cavendish family became even more awkward.

She was already a burden brought into the Cavendish family by her mother's remarriage, and she had a nominal uncle-niece relationship with William.

A niece having sex with her uncle, regardless of whether they were blood-related, was enough to bring shame and ridicule to the Cavendish family!

As expected, after the incident was exposed, Christina became the city's notorious woman who would stop at nothing to marry into a wealthy family, even scheming against her own uncle!

In her previous life, bearing such infamy, feeling guilty towards William and Jennifer, she was submissive to William after their marriage, hoping to win his heart with her sincerity.

But the outcome was her daughter dying tragically for William and Jennifer's illegitimate child, and she perished in an explosion after setting the villa on fire!

In this new life, she would no longer foolishly hold any expectations for William.

Closing her eyes and opening them again, Christina's eyes were clear.

However, her silence completely ignited Nicholas's anger.

Bang!

Nicholas slammed the cup in his hand on the table. "Christina, you may not be a Cavendish family child, but the Cavendish family has put a lot of effort into raising you. If you make a mistake, you must bear the consequences. Don't you understand this basic principle?"

In her previous life, Nicholas had also hinted that she should take responsibility.

She thought it was her chance, foolishly admitted and apologized, and was scorned by everyone.

In this life, she saw the calculation in Nicholas's eyes.

He hated Elisa, the third son of the prestigious Cavendish family, for marrying a divorced woman with a daughter.

He hated Christina even more, a burden who dared to covet his most outstanding son!

But the "uncle-niece incest" scandal pushed the Cavendish family into the spotlight, and someone had to take the blame.

And Christina was the one Nicholas pushed out to be scorned!

Elisa, frightened by Nicholas's attitude, hurriedly pushed the kneeling Christina beside her.

"Christina, apologize quickly!"

Christina was pushed and almost fell.

Her gaze inadvertently met William's.

William's eyes were cold, looking at her as if she were an ant he could easily crush.

Beside him sat Jennifer, her eyes red and swollen, clearly having just cried.

Meeting Christina's gaze, a trace of venom flashed in Jennifer's eyes.

Christina suddenly realized that it was Jennifer who had drugged William.

Jennifer, of low birth, couldn't win the Cavendish family's approval for her engagement to William despite his sudden announcement of their relationship. She was still disliked by the Cavendish family.

Seeing William at the age to settle down, the Cavendish family was still reluctant to let her marry him, and she panicked.

So she wanted to have sex with William first, hoping to secure her position with a child.

Who knew Christina would unexpectedly intervene.

Christina closed her eyes. Did William know about this?

Whether he knew or not didn't matter anymore.

In this life, she would never have any entanglement with William again!

With this thought, Christina stood up, supporting herself with her hands. "I won't apologize. I did nothing wrong, so why should I apologize?"

Her firm tone left everyone in the living room stunned, then they sneered.

"The paparazzi caught you, and you're still denying it!"

"She's waiting for public pressure to force the Cavendish family to make William marry her!"

"People who do bad things and don't want to be ridiculed and insulted are just like her. I wonder how her mother raised her!"

Hearing this, Elisa's face turned pale, and she almost collapsed.

She slapped Christina's back and twisted her arm. "What nonsense are you talking about? Apologize to your grandfather and the others, apologize quickly!"

Elisa was genuinely afraid, afraid of being kicked out of the Cavendish family, afraid her husband would have a hard time in the Cavendish family. She just wanted Christina to admit her mistake and get this over with.

But she didn't know that once Christina apologized, this matter would never be over.

Christina, in pain, turned pale but looked fearlessly at Nicholas and William. "Do you have evidence that I drugged him, or did you see me in bed with my uncle? If you didn't see it, why do you assume it was me? Just because of a few highly blurred photos taken by the paparazzi? Or did my uncle personally admit that the person that night was me?"

William would never admit it!

He cared so much about Jennifer and despised Christina. How could he admit to having any relationship with her?

So, as long as she denied it, the Cavendish family couldn't pin this on her!

Hearing her confident defense, Nicholas frowned and turned to look at William.

William's face was expressionless, but his aura was chillingly cold.

He lightly turned the jade ring on his thumb, his gaze so cold it seemed to freeze her.

The fear that seeped from her bones and the hatred etched in her blood made Christina almost unable to withstand his gaze.

She feared she might lose control and reveal her inner emotions.

"Oh, now you know to avoid suspicion and call him uncle?" someone sneered, looking at Christina with ridicule.

After all, she had never called William uncle in all her years in the Cavendish family!

Previously, it was thought Christina was just rude, but now it seemed she had been scheming all along.

Christina lowered her eyelashes. "Whether I call him uncle or not, he is still my uncle. Our identities will never change!"

William's movement of turning the ring paused, and his fingers suddenly clenched!

His sharp, icy gaze seemed to pierce through Christina.

Christina remained calm and composed, facing William's immense pressure without flinching.

"You say it wasn't you, but what evidence do you have?"

###chapter 3: It's Jennifer

"I have no evidence, and I don't need any evidence!"

Christina's tone was gentle, yet inexplicably carried a forceful strength. "How could I know about something I wasn't involved in? If you insist on me saying, then I think it's her!"

Her slender finger pointed at Jennifer, who was sitting beside William with a resentful expression.

Jennifer's expression froze, seemingly unable to react to Christina pointing at her.

But soon, she adjusted her expression.

She had been engaged to William for several years, but William had never mentioned marriage.

At first, she thought it was because the Cavendish family disapproved, but back then, the Cavendish family also disapproved of him being with her, yet he still firmly chose to stand by her side. Why couldn't he do it this time?

William's attitude made Jennifer feel a sense of crisis.

She panicked, which is why she drugged William, hoping that after making love, she could force him into marriage.

She didn't expect Christina, that bitch, to take advantage of it!

But now that Christina admitted it was her, if she took the initiative to admit it, she might still succeed in forcing the marriage.

Jennifer glanced at William, then got up and walked to Nicholas, bending her knee and kneeling directly in front of him.

Before she could speak, tears started to fall, "I'm sorry, Nicholas, I was forced and had no other choice. I know you look down on my background, but I truly love William, which is why I resorted to such a desperate measure! The diary was written by me, and the person the paparazzi photographed was also me. It's just that because Christina and I are similar in height and build, it caused a misunderstanding!"

One had to admit, Jennifer's acting was really good.

That look of unrequited love and helplessness was portrayed very vividly by her.

It was to the point where those who heard it would be moved to tears, and those who saw it would feel heartbroken.

Christina watched from the side, unable to help but sigh inwardly. No wonder William was so infatuated with Jennifer in her past life.

If she had even half of Jennifer's acting skills, she wouldn't have lost so miserably.

"You say it's you, then why didn't you admit it earlier?" Nicholas looked at her coldly, his expression unreadable.

Jennifer's heart raced, but she still maintained a sorrowful and mournful look, "I didn't dare to. I was afraid William would look down on me because of it, and even more afraid that you would think I was not self-respecting."

She looked like she was willing to endure any grievance for love, even Christina couldn't help but be moved.

Christina slowly curled her lips, "Since it's now proven that I'm innocent, and Jennifer is Uncle's fiancée, Grandpa might as well fulfill their wish. Announce the truth to the public and let them get married. The rumors online will naturally be dispelled!"

In this life, she chose to step back and fulfill their love.

She wanted to see what William's reaction would be when he finally saw Jennifer's true colors one day!

As for what Nicholas ultimately decided about Jennifer, Christina didn't know.

After clarifying that the matter had nothing to do with her, Christina found an excuse to leave.

After dark, Elisa returned with a very unpleasant expression.

As soon as she entered, she poked Christina's forehead hard with a finger.

"Why did you give up such a golden opportunity? The online rumors have been stirred up so much. If you had just said that you were the one with William that night, your grandfather would have definitely made William marry you!"

Christina's head tilted from the poke, "And then?"

"And then? Then you would become Mrs. Cavendish, and you would never have to worry about food and clothing for the rest of your life. Many happy days would be waiting for you!" Elisa said matter-of-factly.

William was the future head of the Cavendish family. If Christina really married him, with his support, not only would she and her mother be able to hold their heads high in the Cavendish family, but also in the entire Rexington.

Christina knew what her mother was thinking, and she also knew that her mother was scheming for her sake.

Christina couldn't blame her, but she also couldn't agree with what she said.

Because in her past life, she had painfully proven with bloody reality how miserable those so-called "good days" were!

She mercilessly shattered Elisa's beautiful fantasy, "Mom, I wasn't the one!"

Elisa was stunned, then her face darkened, "You can fool others, but you can't fool me."

As she spoke, she suddenly grabbed Christina's collar and pulled it down.

Immediately, the bruises on Christina's delicate skin were exposed to the air, and her expression changed slightly.

Elisa pointed at the bruises, "I'm experienced. Do you think I don't know what these marks on your body mean? Even though you tried to be quiet when you came back that night to avoid waking us, I still knew. Why didn't you cherish such a great opportunity and instead pushed it to that scheming woman Jennifer?"

Christina looked at her mother in surprise, not because her mother discovered what happened that night, but because she saw through Jennifer's disguise.

After all, even someone as wise as William was played by Jennifer.

Christina adjusted her collar, "Mom, do you really think I would have a good life if I married William?"

"What do you mean?" Marrying William wouldn't be good? Then what would be good?

Christina said, "In their eyes, I'm just a burden you brought. Drugging the future head of the Cavendish family to force him into marriage, and most importantly, the other party is my nominal uncle. Not to mention the Cavendish family, even the outside world's insults would be enough to make my life miserable."

She paused, then spoke the most crucial reason with difficulty, "Moreover, William only loves Jennifer. If he can't marry the one he loves because of me, do you think he would let me go?"

Elisa was stunned, choked for a long time, and squeezed out, "But I'm tired of living a life where I have to look at others' faces. Why can't you..."

"I can't!" Christina's tone was firm, "Unless you have the guts to force William to marry me!"

Elisa's mouth moved, but she didn't say anything.

Seeing that she had temporarily given up the idea, Christina breathed a sigh of relief and collapsed on the sofa, "Mom, can you help me buy some medicine?"

"Medicine? Are you not feeling well?" Elisa immediately squatted in front of her with concern.

Christina's heart softened, "No, it's birth control pills."

Elisa immediately understood, looking at Christina with a complicated expression, and finally only said, "What are you after?"

After what?

Christina placed her hand on her lower abdomen.

At first, she really wanted to help William because she loved him and couldn't bear to see him suffer.

Later, it was because of a tiny bit of hope in her heart, longing for the day when her dream would come true, so she desperately tried to grasp that one possibility.

But in the end, when William cruelly took Harper's kidney for his and Jennifer's illegitimate child, causing her to die from infection, she finally woke up.

Some people were never meant to be loved or desired by her from the beginning.

So in this life, she didn't want it, didn't ask for it!

She loved Harper, but she couldn't selfishly bring her into such a cold and cruel world again.

Sorry, Harper, please forgive your mother's selfishness and weakness!

In this life, please find different parents!

###chapter 4: The Birth Control Pills Were Switched

When Elisa came in with the purchased birth control pills, Christina was leaning against the headboard reading a book.

"The pills are here, take them quickly." It had been almost forty-eight hours since Christina returned.

If she didn't take them soon, the pills would be useless.

Christina had already placed a glass of warm water on the bedside table. Hearing this, she took out a pill and prepared to put it in her mouth.

"Did you buy these pills yourself?"

"Of course not," Elisa said confidently. "I instructed a servant to buy them. Don't worry, I asked someone privately, no one knows."

After all, she was the wife of the third son of the Cavendish family. Even if her husband was not favored and she was not liked by Nicholas, it would only bring disgrace to the Cavendish family if it got out that she had to buy something herself.

If the Cavendish family lost their dignity, Nicholas would only be angrier.

Elisa would never be so foolish as to do such a thing.

Hearing this, Christina felt a bit relieved.

She put the pill in her mouth and took a big gulp of water.

Even though she had made up her mind, her heart still felt like it was being squeezed, the pain almost bringing her to tears.

Her well-behaved and sensible daughter would never be able to exist in this lifetime.

But she also didn't want her Harper to get entangled in the dirty Cavendish family.

I'm sorry, Harper!

Christina steeled herself and swallowed the pill.

Elisa held the box, "You rest, I'll go dispose of this."

With that, she turned to leave.

At that moment, the bedroom door was suddenly kicked open.

The butler stood at the door with two bodyguards, looking coldly at Christina and Elisa. "Mrs. Cavendish, Ms. Windsor, Mr. Nicholas Cavendish requests your presence."

Christina's heart sank, sensing trouble.

In the living room, the bodyguards dragged Christina over.

The butler handed the outer packaging of the birth control pills, which Elisa hadn't had time to destroy, to Nicholas.

Most of the Cavendish family members were still there, looking at Christina as if she were something filthy.

Especially William, whose gaze was as cold as ice, piercing her heart.

Christina lowered her head, her hands at her sides nervously clenched.

"Bastard!" Nicholas glanced at the pill box, then picked up an ashtray from the table and threw it at Christina. "What is this?"

Bang!

The ashtray hit Christina's head, and bright red blood instantly dripped down her cheek.

She didn't even blink. "Birth control pills!"

The undisguised sneers around her made her voice falter. She bit her lip and continued, "I'm an adult, it's normal to have a relationship!"

Hearing her lie without batting an eye, Nicholas became even angrier, his cane thumping on the floor. "Open your eyes and look clearly, what is that really?"

Christina was stunned.

With trembling hands, Christina picked up the box from the floor. Seeing the words on it, her pupils shrank. How could this be...

Christina looked helplessly at Elisa. The pills were bought by Elisa. Could it be that she hadn't given up and deliberately bought the wrong pills to force her to marry William by getting pregnant?

But when she looked up, she saw a pair of eyes more terrified than hers.

It wasn't Elisa.

Christina's gaze inadvertently met Jennifer's, who was sitting next to William. The malice hidden behind her tearful eyes made Christina's heart tremble.

It was Jennifer!

Christina felt something was wrong and was about to explain when Jennifer suddenly got up and rushed in front of her.

"I'm sorry, Christina. The Cavendish family are good people, I really can't help you hide this and deceive them."

Jennifer cried pitifully, looking at Christina with a sorrowful and desolate expression.

"I thought you were just taking advantage of the situation to fulfill your youthful dreams. I never thought you were secretly trying to get pregnant to force William to marry you and scheme against William and the Cavendish family."

"How can you be so selfish? Have you ever thought about what would happen to me and William if you did this? Even if you don't think about me, you should think about your mother. Her daughter marrying her husband's brother, how would she live in the Cavendish family in the future?"

Jennifer's accusatory words made the Cavendish family furious.

"I've seen shameless people, but never someone so shameless. She is full of schemes to marry into a wealthy family. If she put her little cleverness to good use, she wouldn't be so despised by everyone now!"

"Vicious, truly vicious! She pretends to clear her name, but in reality, she wants to push Jennifer out to divert attention so she can secretly get pregnant with William's child. I've seen how bad a person's heart can be today!"

"Such a scourge cannot stay in our Cavendish family!"

Someone suggested kicking Christina out of the Cavendish family.

Christina was not surprised at all.

In her previous life, wasn't it the same? As long as Jennifer slightly stirred public opinion, she would become the target of everyone's anger.

She quietly watched Jennifer's performance, feeling no waves in her heart.

Seeing her reaction, Jennifer found it strange.

When did Christina become so calm and composed?

In the past, she would have been anxiously defending herself, fearing being misunderstood by the Cavendish family and being kicked out with her mother.

But today, she was unmoved.

Could she have some backup plan?

No, impossible.

Christina had no idea she had switched the pills. Christina, caught off guard by the Cavendish family's questioning and her malicious slander, had no reason not to panic.

Moreover, William and Nicholas were so shrewd, how could they believe her just because Christina tried to push the blame on her?

Not to mention the photos clearly showed Christina. And William, wouldn't he know who he slept with?

Jennifer pursed her lips, ready to deliver a fatal blow to Christina.

She turned to William and cried, "William, I believe Christina didn't do it on purpose. She must have her own reasons. Please forgive her this time, just pretend it was me that night. I'm willing to bear all the public pressure for the Cavendish family."

Jennifer's voice was gentle and soft, and when she deliberately spoke with a sob, it easily aroused others' pity.

If one only listened to her voice and words, they would be moved by her deep affection.

Christina sighed softly, feeling helpless. "I think what you're saying makes no sense!"

Jennifer was stunned.

Christina continued, "I've already explained, it wasn't me that night. Why do you keep insisting it was me? I don't understand, you're my uncle's fiancée, do you really want him to be involved with another woman besides you? You say it was you, and my uncle didn't refute it, but you're the one rushing to explain. Why, do you not want to marry my uncle?"

Jennifer's expression stiffened, and she hurriedly turned to explain, "No, I'm not, I didn't, don't talk nonsense!"

###chapter 5: Termination of Relationship

Perhaps realizing her reaction was too intense, Jennifer immediately softened her voice, "I said, the Cavendish family are all good people. I don't want the Cavendish family to be deceived by you, so..."

"You don't want them to be deceived, but by deliberately slandering me, aren't you deceiving them?" Christina shrugged. "I think I look decent enough, not so ugly that no one would want me. Or do you think that if I were really pregnant, the only man left in the world would be my uncle? Can't I be with someone else?"

In this life, the last thing she wanted was to be entangled with William!

But despite her best efforts to change her fate, it seemed everyone was pushing them together.

This feeling made her very agitated!

As soon as Christina finished speaking, a figure suddenly stood up from the sofa and quickly rushed to her, grabbing her by the neck.

His cold, deep eyes locked onto her face, and his icy fingertips gradually tightened, depriving her of breath.

"What did you say?" William's eyes were filled with anger, hiding emotions that Christina couldn't understand.

The overwhelming aura made Christina feel a bit overwhelmed, her face turning slightly pale.

She opened her mouth but didn't dare to repeat what she had just said.

But why?

He had always avoided her like the plague, and in their past life, he had hated her to the core because she apologized, assuming she had drugged him.

Even Harper, because she was her child, was ignored and treated coldly by him.

In the end, he even cruelly took a kidney from Harper to save the child of the woman he loved.

Harper was so young, and just to get a bit of his affection, she willingly gave up one of her kidneys.

But he didn't even look at Harper because of it.

Even when Harper got an infection after the surgery, and she was kidnapped and the doctor couldn't reach her, he thought it was all an excuse she made up to compete with Jennifer for his attention, leading to Harper missing the best time for rescue.

Hatred surged in her heart, and no matter how much Christina tried to control it, some emotions still leaked from her eyes.

She stubbornly met William's gaze and said loudly, word by word, "I said, you are my uncle. I could be with anyone, but I would never be with you and have your child. I still understand the basic principles of decency! What do you think, Uncle?"

William's eyes suddenly narrowed dangerously.

The hand around Christina's neck tightened instantly, and her face visibly turned purple as her breath was taken away.

"William, William, please let Christina go." Usually, in the Cavendish family, Elisa was most afraid of William, but seeing her daughter about to be strangled to death, she had to step in to stop him. "Christina really didn't mean to force you into anything. She really asked me to buy contraceptive pills. I don't know why it turned into..."

A cold, sword-like gaze suddenly fell on her face.

Elisa was so frightened by that deathly stare that her legs went weak, almost collapsing to the ground.

Even though she managed to stay standing, her legs trembled uncontrollably, and she couldn't say another word.

The atmosphere in the living room became so heavy that it was hard to breathe, and William's violent aura made everyone afraid to speak.

Even though Christina was suffocating, with tears streaming from her eyes and her face turning a horrifying purple, no one dared to intervene.

Finally, a clueless servant suddenly ran in from outside, "Ms. Cavendish, you have a delivery."

Sensing the tense atmosphere in the living room, the servant holding the bag trembled.

Nicholas frowned and sneered, "Enough!"

In the Cavendish family, William might not listen to anyone, but he still had to respect Nicholas.

So he loosened his grip, and Christina collapsed to the ground like a rag doll.

Air rushed into her lungs, causing her to cough uncontrollably, her lungs feeling like they were about to explode with pain.

But she still forced herself to get up from the ground, step by step, and walked to the servant, taking the bag from his hand.

She opened the bag and took out the contents.

Everyone saw the large letters on the box: Contraceptive Pills!

In front of everyone, she opened the box, took out all the pills, and spread them in her palm.

"Uncle, rest assured, I, Christina, will keep my word. No matter whose child I might be carrying, it will never be yours!"

With that, she tilted her head back and swallowed all the pills, not even using water, chewing them like candy.

Everyone present was stunned by the crazed look on her face.

Elisa cried as she hugged her, trying to get the pills out of her mouth.

"Are you crazy? You can't just take contraceptive pills like that! You're not even married yet. What if you harm your body and ruin your life?"

Christina kept her mouth tightly shut, refusing to let her take the pills out, determined to chew and swallow them all.

She looked at William with a mocking gaze, "Is that enough? If not, there's more!"

As she spoke, she was about to take out the remaining pills.

Elisa cried and stopped her, "Enough, enough! Christina, don't take any more. You'll die if you do!"

She was afraid of the Cavendish family, but she loved her daughter more.

At this moment, everyone was against them, and the despair of being isolated made her break down in tears.

The third son of the Cavendish family, Raymond Cavendish, who had always been invisible, couldn't help but step forward.

"William, do you really want to force Christina to death? Even if she doesn't have the Cavendish name, she's lived in the Cavendish family for so many years. If we really force her to death because of a misunderstanding, what will happen to the Cavendish family's reputation? What about your reputation?"

Raymond panted heavily, glaring at William with helplessness and resentment.

In the quiet living room, Elisa's sobs were the only sound. It wasn't loud, but it was impossible to ignore.

It was even... irritating!

William frowned in annoyance, his cold eyes fixed on Christina's stubborn expression, as if she would continue to chew the remaining pills if he said it wasn't enough.

William irritably tugged at his tie and growled, "Get out!"

The invisible anger spread through the living room, making everyone shiver.

Nicholas frowned and waved his hand, signaling Christina to leave quickly.

Christina clenched her palms, using the pain to stay clear-headed.

She straightened her back as much as she could and bowed slightly to Nicholas, "I know my presence has been a thorn in your side. Since that's the case, I'll move out of the Cavendish Mansion starting today. From now on, I will have nothing to do with the Cavendish family."

"Thank you for taking care of me all these years. I hope you take care of yourself!"

With that, Christina turned and left.

Having lived another life, she no longer wanted to stay in this dirty Cavendish family!

###chapter 6: Christina, You Don't Have a Single Truth

But as soon as Christina walked out, a strong wave of nausea hit her.

She felt dizzy and nauseous.

This was a gastrointestinal reaction from swallowing the birth control pill dry.

She urgently wanted to find a glass of water.

Unexpectedly, a bottle of water was handed to her.

Christina looked up and saw it was her mother, Elisa. Elisa looked at her with concern, "You're too stubborn. You can't swallow any medicine dry! How can I praise you?"

"Then don't."

Christina opened the mineral water and drank half of it, the nausea subsiding a bit.

Elisa said bitterly, "I went through so much trouble, begging Raymond to let me bring you into the Cavendish family. I did it so you could use the Cavendish family's reputation to find a good match."

Now, which wealthy young man would want Christina, who was no longer a virgin?

Christina was a bit impatient, "Stop it. I don't want to live relying on men like you. I'll leave the Cavendish Mansion early tomorrow. If you miss me, we can meet outside."

"You!"

Elisa was completely taken aback by Christina's attitude. She said disappointedly, "Once you leave the Cavendish family, who will know who you are?"

"And who am I in the Cavendish family? A burden you brought in, or a scheming woman who seduced her uncle?"

Christina sneered.

The Cavendish family never took her seriously. She was even less important than Nicholas's big black dog.

Outside?

From school until now, who didn't call her a burden, a bastard born from an affair?

In this new life, she no longer wanted to hear those insults. She no longer wanted to live under the judgmental eyes of others. She would live for herself, and live beautifully!

Elisa was left speechless.

Christina said nothing more and turned back to her room.

Elisa was helpless.

When she finally decided to follow, a hand stopped her.

Elisa turned around and saw it was her husband, Raymond. Raymond shook his head, signaling her, "Let her calm down and process her emotions."

"Raymond, I don't know what to do anymore." Elisa fell into Raymond's arms.

Raymond patted her shoulder, "Don't worry, this matter has been handled. When Christina's mood improves, I'll introduce her to some potential matches."

"In today's society, what you're worried about doesn't even exist."

Not far behind them was William.

William heard this and his face turned extremely displeased, his eyes filled with endless coldness and fierceness.

Early the next morning, Christina packed her things and left the Cavendish Mansion.

The Cavendish Mansion was located halfway up Purple Cloud Mountain in Stargate City.

This was a private residential area, and outside cars couldn't enter without the owner's permission.

She booked a car online, and it was waiting for her at the foot of the mountain.

But before she could go down, a black Maybach stopped in front of her.

The license plate ended in 7307.

It was William's car.

Christina didn't care and continued walking with her suitcase.

Unexpectedly, a voice called out from behind, "Ms. Windsor, Mr. William Cavendish wants you to get in the car."

Christina didn't respond, but her mind automatically pictured William sitting in the back seat, his thin lips tightly pressed, his whole body exuding hostility.

William didn't like anyone defying him.

But this wasn't the past life.

She was no longer the Christina who would do anything to please him!

"I took the birth control pill, and I've made my stance clear. Uncle, do you need me dead to feel at ease?"

Christina turned to stare at the black Maybach in front of her.

"Ms. Windsor, speaking to Mr. William Cavendish like that shows a lack of respect. Mr. William Cavendish has been kind to you. If you insist on not getting in the car..."

Assistant Bob Smith didn't finish his sentence, but his maintained smile was terrifying to Christina.

She knew William's methods.

As his top assistant, Bob's methods were even more formidable.

Christina didn't want to be killed by William right at the start, so she compromised. Bob threw her luggage into the trunk, and she opened the door and got into the back seat.

William was sitting in the back seat, dressed in a black suit, leaning against the seat, legs crossed, his face dark and imposing like a king.

William's eyes looked over, "What rumors are you spreading so early in the morning?"

His voice was so cold it made people shiver.

Christina pursed her lips and slowly said, "If Uncle doesn't have the intentions I think, then what are your intentions?"

She secretly pinched her palm and looked up at William.

William's expression was cold, his eyes sharp like a blunt knife.

William was dangerous, cold, and ruthless.

Before William could say anything, Christina's phone rang.

It was a call from Raymond.

Thinking of her mother who still needed to rely on Raymond in the Cavendish family, she answered the call.

"Raymond."

She didn't see William's slightly furrowed brow beside her.

"Christina, you're not a child anymore. Where are you going without telling your mother? Do you know how worried she is?"

Elisa's crying voice came through the phone, "Christina, stop it. Where can you go?"

"I'm going to find a job that provides food and accommodation."

In any case, as long as she wasn't lazy, she wouldn't starve.

She didn't want to stay a second longer in the Cavendish Mansion, a place full of schemes and calculations.

"What kind of job can you find on your own? You..." Elisa suddenly changed her tone, "Fine, it's good for you to stay out for a few days. When you come back, Raymond will arrange some matches for you. Women have to get married eventually. It's better to marry someone we know than to suffer on your own."

Christina didn't want to hear any of this, "My ride is here, I have to go."

William's lips curled into a sneer, "A ride?"

"Christina, your lies come so easily. It seems none of your words are true."

She had said many things, trying to distance herself from William since realizing she had been reborn.

Before her rebirth, she had foolishly confessed her love for William.

Because William had appeared like a deity when she was at her lowest, she had remembered his face and held him in her heart.

But in her past life, his coldness and her daughter's tragic death had overturned everything.

Even if she feared him.

Christina clenched her palm and said softly, "Mr. William Cavendish, you're so high and mighty, why do you care about what I say? Besides, I took the birth control pill in front of you."

She sat beside him, head held high.

William frowned, "Mr. William Cavendish?"

In an instant, Christina felt an overwhelming coldness envelop her, as if she had been thrown into an ice cellar.

###chapter 7: All the Hateful People Should Die

Christina remained calm, "I'm not a child of the Cavendish family. Now that I've left the Cavendish Mansion, it's impossible for me to still cling to you, right?"

William's eyes darkened upon hearing this. He reached out and grabbed Christina's neck, "Are you saying that I need to cling to you?"

His eyes were filled with endless coldness and ferocity.

Christina knew she was in great danger.

But!

"What I'm saying is the truth!" Christina gritted her teeth.

William's fingers tightened instantly, and Christina felt like she was about to suffocate.

William coldly reprimanded, "You leave the Cavendish Mansion at this critical moment, sever ties with the Cavendish family, causing the public to criticize the Cavendish family, and a few months later, you show up with a pregnant belly, is that it?"

Christina instinctively struggled, but she was no match for William.

Her face turned red, and her nose felt sore.

She didn't want to die!

Holding onto this belief, Christina kept waving her hands.

"Bang!"

Christina was thrown to the floor by William, "Bob, pull over and get out."

"Yes."

Bob responded quickly, and the next second, the car stopped.

William leaned slightly, and a large hand reached over to grab Christina's wrist.

Christina was thrown back onto the seat by William.

"Bang!"

Her head hit the window, and it hurt.

Christina saw the scratch marks on William's face.

"What do you want from me?" She had already deviated from the path of her previous life. She just wanted to avoid William, to stay away from the Cavendish family.

Why was that not possible?

William seemed to hear the biggest joke in the world. He coldly sneered, "Let you go? Christina, you provoked me. You want to affect the Cavendish family, to deceive us, that's impossible."

Christina realized the danger and immediately tried to open the car door, but William's hand slapped against the window.

Her escape plan failed!

William reclined the front seat, grabbed the back of Christina's shirt, and lifted her onto his lap like a small chicken.

Christina was facing away from him.

Christina instinctively struggled, but the strength difference between men and women was significant.

Her proud back was forcefully pressed down by William.

In an instant, under William's force, her naked body was exposed, the red marks on her skin were so obvious.

These were all left by him last night.

Christina continued to struggle, "Last night was an accident. If you dare touch me today, it will be rape!"

Christina knew William's methods, but she was not willing to be humiliated.

In the long years of her previous life, William believed she had drugged him, and later, under public pressure, he married her. Her humility and attempts to please him never won William's heart.

Every time William made love to her, it was to punish her. She couldn't see his face, and it was always in the most humiliating way.

Christina's whole body trembled uncontrollably.

It was an instinctive aversion, and an endless sorrow deep in her heart!

William hated being threatened the most.

He gripped Christina's waist, his lips curling into a cold smile, "Then let's see how you call the police to arrest me."

This was still the Cavendish family's territory. Who would dare check his luxury car?

Moreover, his assistant Bob had already gotten out of the car and was standing guard not far away.

Christina gritted her teeth, enduring the humiliation, a plan forming in her mind.

But William didn't give her a chance to get out of the car.

After William finished punishing her, he grabbed her wrist and called Bob, "Come back and drive, head towards Misthaven Manor."

"Yes."

In less than a minute, Bob returned to drive.

Christina knew she couldn't jump out of the car, and she certainly wouldn't risk her life. She could only follow William to the destination and then think of a plan.

Unexpectedly, William held her hand tightly, trying to drag her out of the car.

Christina said coldly, "Mr. Cavendish, your place is so well-guarded, I don't have three heads and six arms, I'm not as powerful as you think."

William didn't say anything, his cold gaze falling on Christina.

Last night, after being drugged, Christina went from struggling to being proactive, from being shy to being passionate. William hadn't forgotten.

But now, Christina was so cold.

"You are the best actress I've ever seen."

William's evaluation of her was as disdainful as in her previous life. But she was no longer the Christina of her previous life; she had awakened.

She sneered sarcastically, "I'm such a good actress, what about you? Aren't you also two-faced, saying one moment that I'm malicious, deceiving and scheming against you, and the next moment wanting to make love to me. William, you're so perverted, no wonder no woman stays by your side!"

Bob behind them was shocked!

He was utterly dumbfounded.

Was this still the timid, stammering burden of the Cavendish family?

And she said these things in front of Mr. William Cavendish, did she have a death wish?

William's grip tightened, and Christina felt her wrist was about to be crushed, but she didn't cry out in pain, nor did she make any move.

Christina even smiled at William, "Angry out of shame."

"Do you think reverse psychology will make me let you go?" William's thin lips moved coldly, "For the next few months, you will stay here!"

"What, are you planning to hide me secretly?"

Originally, she thought that after what happened last night, she had completely distanced herself from William. But unexpectedly, William was unwilling to let her go.

Then, people she hated should all die!

If she couldn't have peace, neither should he.

With a "crack," intense pain spread from her hand.

Christina's hand was broken by William, who then threw her aside, "You better think carefully about how to talk to me to ensure you don't die."

The next second, William turned around, his cold eyes sweeping towards Bob, "Give the order, keep a close watch on her. If she escapes, none of you will live."

William's voice was cold and devoid of warmth.

But with his ruthless methods, Christina knew William could do it.

Soon, someone came to take her.

"Ms. Windsor, come with me. I'll take you to your room."

The room William arranged for her was just an ordinary guest room, but it was well-equipped with air conditioning, a washing machine, and a water dispenser.

In this information age, Christina went online and made an appointment with a doctor. Her hand was broken by William, and she didn't want to end up with a disabled left hand.

Meanwhile, on William's side.

Bob stood in front of him, hesitating for a long time before finally speaking, "Mr. Cavendish, keeping Christina here might not be a good idea, right?"

After all, Elisa still belonged to the Cavendish family, as William's third brother's wife, Christina should call him uncle!

###chapter 8: I Won't Give You This Opportunity Either

Christina staying here will definitely cause a lot of gossip.

Bob considered this and didn't want William to be implicated by Christina.

William shot a sharp, cold look at Bob, "Then tell me, is there a better way?"

The contrast between Christina and William's identities was stark. Christina had suffered unfair treatment for so many years, and she would definitely want to take this opportunity to break free.

Christina wouldn't miss this good opportunity.

Instead of letting Christina be outside, scheming and using despicable means, it would be better to keep her close, within his sight.

This way, Christina wouldn't be able to cause too much trouble.

Bob was silent.

He couldn't think of a better way.

William said coldly, "You handle the defense and manpower."

"Yes."

With William's arrangement, Bob had nothing more to say.

William went to the study.

The desk was piled with documents that needed to be dealt with recently. He was already overwhelmed, and the trouble Christina caused only added to his frustration.

Suddenly, his phone rang.

He picked it up and his expression darkened, "What is it?"

"Check out what I sent you on Facebook."

William frowned and looked. What caught his eye was a message seeking medical help: [Is there a doctor who makes house calls? I broke my hand and it's inconvenient to go out.]

The address was his property, Moonlight Citadel.

The patient's information was simple: [Ms. Windsor, 21 years old.]

William's eyes darkened. Wasn't this Christina!

"Where did you get this?"

Even if Christina was seeking medical help, how did this message end up with Joseph Lucius!

Joseph rubbed his forehead, extremely troubled, "Isn't it because the hospital is having a promotion, opening up online appointments? Now that she's paid the deposit, I can't cancel the order. So I'm calling to confirm, do you have a Ms. Windsor there?"

Joseph tried to recall every woman around William, including even a mosquito.

William had always been career-focused, with only Jennifer, who grew up with him, around. He hadn't seen him with any other woman.

This woman seeking medical help was only 21 years old.

She couldn't possibly be a college student William was keeping, right?

"Come over."

William's voice was low.

Joseph: "Oh my God! Are you serious?"

William's voice was cold, "You took the order, stop talking nonsense."

Joseph was speechless.

Did he want this?

If it weren't for the hospital's promotion, opening up his appointment slots online, and if he weren't concerned about his reputation, he would have ignored it!

Now?

The order was there, and William had given the word, so he had to go.

And William.

He clutched his phone and went to the guest room where Christina was staying.

Christina was browsing job listings. In her previous life, because she had slept with William and was pressured by the Cavendish family, she married William later.

She had almost given up everything for herself.

Now, living a second life, she only cared about herself.

However, she hadn't found anything suitable yet.

Unexpectedly, she heard approaching footsteps from behind. She thought it was a servant and immediately frowned in displeasure, "Didn't William set any rules for you?"

"What rules do you want?" A cold voice, like a venomous snake, instantly pierced Christina's heart.

Christina immediately lost interest.

She turned around and saw William striding towards her.

He was 6 feet 5.35 inches tall, standing in front of her like a towering mountain. In an instant, Christina felt a heavy sense of oppression.

She could hardly breathe.

She thought it was his servant.

But she had said everything she needed to say and made her stance clear.

Why was William here now?

Christina's breath trembled, "What do you want? You can't possibly want to take out my uterus and keep me under your watch 24/7, can you?"

"Even if I did, so what? Can I trap your heart?" William sneered, full of mockery.

William always believed she wanted to seduce him and use him to rise.

The next second, William showed Christina the screenshot Joseph had sent, "Read the words on this for me."

Christina's heart sank.

How did her message seeking medical help end up in William's hands?

What was William trying to do?

"I was just looking for a doctor for myself. William, how long can you keep me here? Even if the birth control pills are fine, if there were a problem, would you kill me?" Christina gritted her teeth.

William didn't even consider Christina, "If you do get pregnant, just abort it."

William's eyes were filled with endless ferocity.

Christina's heart felt like it was shattering.

She thought of Harper's tragic fate in her previous life. Harper was so adorable, so eager for William to give her a bit of fatherly love, to notice her a little.

But William was indifferent, only loving Jennifer's child, Mike.

Christina had foolishly thought that William married her in their previous life because of the child in her womb. She had naively hoped to move William's heart with the child.

But it ended up like that. How laughable, she was the dumbest fool in the world!

"Rest assured, no matter whose child I carry, it will never be yours." Christina clenched her palms so tightly that her nails dug into her flesh without her noticing.

She hated.

She wished she could drag William to die with her right now.

But.

Living a second life, life was so precious, she had many things left undone. Letting William die easily would be too lenient for him.

Besides, Jennifer hadn't paid the price yet.

And the other members of the Cavendish family who had belittled and insulted her.

"I won't give you that chance either." William's eyes were like they were poisoned, his expression venomous.

Christina's lips curled into a mocking smile, "Then why are you here? Just to question me with those things on your phone?"

How much did William despise her, not even willing to give her the most basic rights, and even suspecting her.

She had loved him so much in her previous life.

Christina took a deep breath. She had been reborn, why think about the past?

William coldly warned, "You better stop these little tricks, or don't blame me for being rude."

Christina had seen his methods.

He would definitely do what he said.

Christina didn't want to provoke him, but he was the one blocking all her paths.

"You don't want to let me go, and you don't want to believe me. Anyway, seeking medical help is my right. If you won't even give me this right..."

Before Christina could finish, William's phone rang.

William gave Christina a cold look, then his tone softened, "Jennifer, what's up?"

###chapter 9 Christina, just you wait

The voice on the phone was not Jennifer's, but rather a strange, urgent female voice.

"Mr. William Cavendish, something terrible has happened. Someone online is spreading rumors that Jennifer is a scheming woman who drugged you, and angry netizens have come to the door to throw eggs at Jennifer."

"Jennifer has now attempted suicide and is in the hospital."

William's face darkened, and he was immediately shrouded in gloom.

Last night, Jennifer admitted that she drugged him, and she confessed in the Cavendish Mansion hall. Who in the Cavendish family would spread this gossip?

Except Christina!

William clenched his phone tightly, gritting his teeth, "Take care of her first, I'm on my way."

With that, William moved closer to Christina.

William had just taken the call, and his expression showed a hint of urgency. The only person who could make William so anxious was Jennifer.

All of William's tenderness and concern were given to Jennifer.

But what William gave to Christina was endless cruelty and dominance.

He was even condescending.

William forcefully grabbed her chin, as if he wanted to crush her jaw, "Christina, how can you be so despicable and shameless?"

"Are you trying to drive her to death?"

Drive who to death?

Jennifer?

Besides pretending to be pitiful, acting weak, and attempting suicide at the drop of a hat, what else could Jennifer do?

"Do you have any evidence that I harmed her?"

She would never admit to something without evidence.

Moreover, she was being wronged for something she didn't do.

"If it wasn't you, who else could it be?" William's eyes were cold.

In both past and present lives, no matter what happened, William never believed her. She wouldn't beg William to believe her like she did in her past life.

Christina used her other free hand to grip William's wrist tightly.

William had broken her hand.

Now he wanted to crush her jaw too. Did he really think she was easy to bully?

Even though Christina felt a warm sensation between her fingers, she didn't intend to let go. She gritted her teeth, "If you don't have evidence, then you're slandering me. William, if you have the guts, show me the evidence. Otherwise, I can sue you for defamation!"

William sneered, "Do you really think I can't find evidence?"

"Christina, just you wait."

"If anything happens to her, I won't let you off."

William forcefully pushed her away.

The difference in strength between men and women almost caused Christina to be thrown to the ground by William.

Christina wasn't afraid, "If anything happens to me, I won't let you off either!"

With that, William left.

In the large, quiet room, Christina thought of her daughter Harper.

During the days when William wasn't with them, Harper was so sensible and obedient, playing hide-and-seek with her and fantasizing about every corner of the villa.

Harper had the biggest dreams.

"Mommy, Harper wants to turn the room into a fairy tale world. Can Harper draw?"

"Mommy, when Harper grows up and makes money, I'll buy you lots of delicious food and beautiful dresses. I'll also take you around the world."

"Mommy..."

"Yes."

Christina responded instinctively.

But where was Harper's figure around her? Tears instantly blurred her vision. In the end, she couldn't hold back the grief that surged in her heart.

She was hysterical.

In this life, she could never hold her sensible and obedient daughter again.

She didn't know how much time had passed when someone knocked on the door.

She quickly wiped away her tears, "Come in."

The next second, a servant led a tall, handsome man into the room, carrying a medical kit.

Christina recognized him, Joseph, William's doctor friend. In her past life, Joseph became the most outstanding chief physician in both internal and external medicine.

But.

Joseph didn't believe Harper was sick and didn't treat her.

"What are you doing here?" Christina was hostile towards him.

Joseph didn't expect to see Christina. But then again, why was Christina so hostile towards him?

Joseph smiled, "You posted a message online. Why do you think I'm here?"

Christina pursed her lips. She didn't expect that her online message would attract Joseph. But! This made Christina even more resentful.

Joseph could come to save someone because of an online order, but he couldn't save her, thinking she was lying when she took Harper to the hospital in the dead of winter.

"Go back." Christina said coldly. She considered the deposit she paid online as wasted.

Joseph was speechless.

"You placed the order, and now you're telling me to leave. Christina, what kind of madness is this?"

Wasn't this causing trouble for him?

But Joseph looked around and didn't see William, so he casually asked, "Where's William? Where is he?"

Christina didn't speak kindly to him, "Don't you have his number? If you want to find him, you can call him. William and I are not one, why are you asking me?"

Joseph fell silent.

He was also getting angry, "Christina, I haven't offended you, have I? Why are you so hostile towards me?"

He threw the medical kit in front of Christina.

When Christina tried to throw it back at him, Joseph pressed down on the kit. Joseph grabbed Christina's hand, and she instinctively struggled.

During this time, Joseph noticed that Christina's hand was the problem.

His face darkened, "Come help me hold her down."

Joseph was William's good friend, and the servants didn't dare disobey him.

Even if Christina wanted to struggle, she couldn't shake off the two of them.

Joseph was professional. He quickly set Christina's bone and then put a cast on her.

To complete the order, Joseph even took a photo of Christina's hand. He couldn't help but complain, "I don't know why you're being so difficult. We know each other, and you placed the order. You're acting like I did something to you!"

Joseph's cold observation was from the past life, but Joseph was still Joseph, and that couldn't be changed.

Christina said indifferently, "Do you need a reason to dislike someone?"

"You!"

Joseph felt like he was about to be driven mad by Christina. They hadn't had any contact before, and Christina's hostility towards him was too deep.

He thought about it and realized they hadn't had any conflicts.

Could it be, Joseph frowned, "Is Elaine Morris your friend?"

"I don't know her."

"Damn it, then why are you treating me like this?"

Joseph was furious.

But Christina gave the servant a look, "I'm going to sleep now. Please take him out. I'll continue to pay the consultation fee online."

But! She was going to give Joseph a bad review!

Meanwhile, Jennifer wasn't pretending to commit suicide, wasn't she claiming to be a talented woman?

###chapter 10: I Report with My Real Name

Christina wanted to see how Jennifer could still be a talented woman in this lifetime!

After Joseph and the servant left, Christina first submitted a consultation fee online and gave a bad review. Then, she called to report Jennifer for using a ghostwriter.

In her previous life, Jennifer had used a ghostwriter for her writing. Later, after Christina married William, she discovered that all her design drawings had been taken by William and given to Jennifer.

She watched Jennifer transform into a bestselling author and painter.

And she, still foolishly hoping that William would be moved and love her.

In the end, she lost her achievements, her daughter, and even her own life.

But.

The publishing house and the architecture firm didn't believe Christina's words at all.

"You need evidence to report someone. Do you have any recordings or videos?"

"I, Christina, am reporting this under my real name."

If Jennifer was reported, she would definitely cry in front of William, and William would definitely come after Christina. However, since she had decided to take this step, she had nothing to fear.

"You can investigate thoroughly. And now, isn't the annual Golden Cup Award about to start? Think about it, how can one person, no matter how excellent, be both a high-ranking official in the architecture firm and a bestselling female author?"

Even after she completely focused on her family, Jennifer still managed to become a jewelry designer.

All of this was achieved using Christina's work.

At home, Christina spent days and nights racking her brains waiting for William, trying to find something to pass the time, only to have William use it to elevate Jennifer.

In her previous life, Jennifer enjoyed her achievements so much. In this life, Christina would make Jennifer suffer as much as possible!

The staff on the other end pondered for a moment, "Based on your report, we will investigate. If it is true, we will give you a $50,000 reward."

"Otherwise, you will pay the price for fabricating facts."

Jennifer using a ghostwriter was a fact. She was reporting this under her real name, so the architecture firm and the publishing house would definitely investigate. And she only needed to face William.

Although William's methods were ruthless, this was a society governed by law. William couldn't possibly kill her.

Even if he did kill her, it would be worth it to take him and Jennifer down with her!

Christina was very firm, "Yes, I am reporting this under my real name."

After the other party recorded her identity information, phone number, and address, Christina hung up the phone and signed herself up for this year's Golden Cup Award.

In this life, all the glory should belong to her.

On Joseph's side.

He had just gotten into the car when he heard a notification on his phone. He instinctively took out his phone. When he saw it, he was furious.

Christina had given him a bad review!

How dare she!

Joseph wanted to rush back and open Christina's head to see what was inside. But he held back his anger.

If he really lost control and hit Christina, and Christina spread rumors outside, what would happen to his reputation? Could he still be a doctor?

Suppressing his urge to get angry, Joseph called William.

William was now by Jennifer's hospital bed. Jennifer had slit her wrists and just been resuscitated. The machines were beeping, and Jennifer had not yet regained consciousness.

"What is it?"

William hadn't forgotten about Christina placing an order with Joseph online.

Joseph was extremely frustrated, "That burden your third uncle's wife brought, I think she's been stimulated. She showed such hostility towards me and even gave me a bad review! I'm telling you, if it weren't for your sake, if it weren't for the fact that a gentleman doesn't argue with a woman, I would have dealt with her!"

Joseph was getting angrier as he spoke.

It was clear that Joseph was really provoked by Christina.

Christina and Joseph had never had any conflicts before. Now, Christina's behavior was undoubtedly crazy.

Was she trying to get his attention?

William's thin lips curled coldly, "I know about the bad review. Just come to the hospital."

"What? That's your reaction?"

Joseph was extremely dissatisfied.

William's voice was low and stern, "What else do you want me to do? Do you want me to personally bring Christina to you to apologize?"

Joseph snorted, "Having her kneel and apologize to me wouldn't be too much. You handle it. I don't want people to think I'm bullying a young girl."

His reputation was well-known, and Christina giving him a bad review was the first bad review in his life. How could he not be angry?

However, on the hospital bed, when Jennifer heard the name "Christina," a deep malice flashed in her heart.

If it weren't for Christina, today's situation wouldn't have happened, and she wouldn't have had to hurt herself.

"William, I'm sorry. Please don't ignore me."

Jennifer murmured.

William heard it. He turned his head and saw Jennifer on the hospital bed, her brows furrowed, her face pale, full of pain.

"I won't blame you."

William held her hand and comforted her softly.

Jennifer opened her eyes at this moment. Seeing William, her eyes were filled with sorrow, "William, I really know I was wrong, but I didn't expect someone to want me dead."

As soon as she said this, before William could respond, Jennifer's phone rang.

William saw that the number was marked by Jennifer. He answered the call and put it on speaker.

"Jennifer, someone has reported you for using a ghostwriter. You'd better come back and cooperate with our architecture firm's investigation."

Jennifer was stunned, "Who reported me? Director, there must be some misunderstanding."

She had worked so hard to build her image, carefully and cautiously. Who would report her?

"That can't be disclosed to you right now. Just come back and cooperate with the investigation." The voice on the other end was very cold, and Jennifer was filled with panic.

The person who reported her chose this moment, clearly doing it on purpose.

Especially!

William was right next to her and heard everything!

How could she face William?

"Director, I am really being wronged. I am in the hospital right now."

Jennifer started crying in grievance.

But the other party didn't listen to her explanation at all. She could only look at William with tearful eyes, "William, I didn't use a ghostwriter. Everything was achieved through my own efforts. I don't understand why someone would do this to me. This is clearly an attempt to destroy me!"

William handed her a tissue, "If you didn't do it, no one can falsely accuse you. Don't think too much. I'll help you resolve this matter."

Jennifer's kindness was enough for him to do anything for her now.

Jennifer knew William would help, but if William investigated deeply, wouldn't he eventually find out the truth himself?

###chapter 11: Christina, who taught you to do this?

Jennifer lowered her head, "Forget it, William. I'll handle this myself. The online public opinion is very unfriendly towards me right now."

"I've already asked Bob to take care of the public opinion. You should rest well."

"But I need to go to the architecture institute to deal with this matter."

Jennifer didn't look up.

At that moment, Jennifer's phone rang again.

William put it on speaker.

"Ms. Spencer, someone has reported that you hired a ghostwriter for your latest manuscript that's about to be published. We need to thoroughly investigate it. If we find that your previous books were also ghostwritten, we will take down all your books and reclaim all your royalties."

Upon hearing this, Jennifer couldn't sit still.

It was one thing to be accused of having issues with her design drafts, but now they were saying her novels were also ghostwritten.

It couldn't be that the people she had under her wing were all conspiring against her, right?

Jennifer decided to go to the architecture institute.

"William, I need to handle this matter now. Thank you for being by my side immediately. But I've never been someone who is easily bullied."

"I'll take you."

William said slowly.

The next second, he reached out to support Jennifer. Jennifer leaned on William's shoulder and walked out of the hospital room step by step.

Meanwhile, on Christina's side.

She had encountered problems when signing up for the Golden Cup Award. The architecture institute told her, "Our institute has been strictly screening talents recently, and you just made a report call. Now you want to sign up for the competition, which clearly seems like you're trying to attract attention and create a sensation."

"No."

"Do you have any evidence to prove that the other party hired a ghostwriter? If you have evidence, you can come and submit it now."

The architecture institute hung up the phone after saying this because Christina's actions of first reporting and then signing up for the competition were highly suspicious.

The main issue was that they had investigated Jennifer's work and found nothing suspicious.

Since she had already reported it, Christina was determined to bring Jennifer down.

She recalled that Jennifer had always secretly hired ghostwriters. After Jennifer received the drafts, the two ghostwriters disappeared without a trace.

However, Jennifer could be asked to produce a draft on the spot.

The key point was that the materials used in Jennifer's designs were different from those used by the ghostwriters.

No one else had noticed this, but in her previous life, Christina had studied Jennifer's work.

Christina decided to go to the architecture institute herself.

The servant had been specifically instructed by William to keep an eye on Christina.

As soon as Christina went downstairs, she was stopped by the servant, "Ms. Windsor, Mr. Cavendish has instructed that you are not allowed to go out without his permission."

Christina looked coldly at the servant, "My hand hurts right now. If something happens to me, can you take responsibility?"

"And if I heard correctly, you called me Ms. Windsor, right?"

"Yes."

The servant lowered her head, not expecting Christina to have such a strong presence.

Christina sneered, "Since you called me Ms. Windsor, it means my status is higher than yours. And William didn't tell you to lock me up, so I am free. If I can't leave today, I'll call the police. You don't want to be charged with unlawful detention, do you?"

A flash of fear crossed the servant's eyes, and she quickly waved her hands, "Ms. Windsor, I'm just following Mr. Cavendish's orders. How dare I do such a thing?"

"William hasn't done anything to me. And I have an urgent matter to attend to. If something happens, I'll take responsibility." With that, Christina left without looking back.

William wanted to keep her here, but she wouldn't be easily bullied. Even if William found out later, he wouldn't do anything to her.

But she never expected that when she arrived at the architecture institute, she would see William and Jennifer there!

William and Jennifer had just arrived and were getting an understanding of the situation.

"What are you here for? I have guests right now. If you have something to say, please wait a moment," said a man with glasses who noticed Christina.

Since Christina was prepared to report Jennifer, she wasn't going to hold back. But she didn't expect that before she could present her evidence, William was already there with Jennifer.

William truly loved Jennifer!

"I am the one who reported Jennifer."

As soon as Christina said this, she noticed William's eyes becoming even colder and more indifferent.

If looks could kill, she would have already died under William's gaze.

Jennifer immediately put on an act, crying with tears in her eyes, "Christina, why are you doing this to me? Is it because I implicated you, so you're taking revenge on me here?"

William took a big step towards her.

As he reached out, Christina quickly dodged him.

Christina said coldly, "Why would I take revenge on you? You did hire a ghostwriter, Ms. Spencer. As a member of the Spencer Family, a literary family, you use the best materials. But the materials in your submitted design drafts are not from the Spencer Family. If you think I'm wronging you, why don't you prove yourself by creating a piece on the spot?"

Christina didn't look at William.

"What special materials? Don't talk nonsense here."

The Spencer Family's materials always included a special gold powder.

This made their artworks shine brilliantly under light.

This was the unique feature of the Spencer Family's artworks, but only the Spencer Family knew about it. How did Christina find out? And she had always been very careful about hiring ghostwriters.

Before this, Christina and she had never interacted. How did Christina suddenly know so much?

Jennifer was anxious but tried to stay calm.

Christina's lips curled into a cold smile, "Whether I'm talking nonsense can be determined by a professional comparison. And the simplest way to prove it is for you to create a piece on the spot."

"Christina, who taught you to do this?"

A cold voice came from the other side.

Christina glanced at William. His eyes were cold and dangerous. At this moment, William was like a venomous snake baring its fangs.

Her back instantly felt a chill.

But she had come this far; how could she back down now?

Christina calmed herself, "No one taught me. I just happened to discover it. The architecture institute cannot be tainted by someone without talent!"

As soon as she said this, an urgent voice came from afar, "Christina, quickly apologize to Mr. Cavendish. Don't slander Ms. Spencer just because Mr. Cavendish and Ms. Spencer are a perfect match. Do you know the consequences of making a false report?"

###chapter 12: The Malicious Best Friend

The sound caught the attention of everyone present.

Christina looked in the direction of the sound and saw her former best friend, Missy Diaz, walking in from outside.

No, she was a malicious friend.

In her previous life, Missy seemed to be teaching her how to win William's heart, but in reality, she was pushing William further away step by step.

And the collaboration project, Missy used her to gather information from William, tricking her into catching William cheating with another woman, which ended up ruining a major deal William was negotiating.

And Christina's daughter, Harper!

Harper had a fever, and William didn't believe it because Missy had already deceived William once. Later, when Harper got sick, William assumed she was using their daughter to lure him back again.

Christina looked at Missy, a fierce glint flashing in her eyes.

In her previous life!

She was truly foolish, loving a scumbag and trusting a malicious friend!

Missy felt a chill under Christina's gaze, "Christina, even if you resent me, I have to say this. I can't just watch you turn your love into hatred. You know that false accusations can land you in jail, right?"

"Hurry up and apologize to Ms. Spencer. Ms. Spencer is kind and won't hold you accountable for the false accusations and online slander."

Missy easily shifted the blame for Jennifer's online harassment onto her?

Christina sneered and retorted, "Are you a worm in my stomach that you know everything I do? How do you know it was me spreading rumors online? I have evidence for my accusations against Christina. Do you have any evidence?"

In her previous life, she truly believed Missy.

She thought Missy was always looking out for her, but now she wouldn't think that way.

Because in the end, when Jennifer returned with her and William's son, Mike, Missy completely cut ties with her and went to curry favor with Jennifer.

Now?

Trying to frame her?

Impossible!

Missy was momentarily speechless, but then she became very aggrieved, "Christina, I'm doing this for your own good. How did you become like this?"

"Your so-called 'for my own good' is trying to make me admit that the online rumors were caused by me. Missy, did I tell you I was going to create rumors, or did you see it with your own eyes?"

Christina went into full battle mode.

But!

This was the architecture institute.

The staff didn't want to see a few people putting on a blame game here. He frowned and said angrily, "This is the architecture institute, not a stage for your talk show. Once you leave this door, do whatever you want."

"The person who made the accusations, stay here. Your words have already caused serious impact on our colleagues at the institute. You will be detained until the investigation is clear."

The staff couldn't let Christina leave the building now.

Jennifer's tears fell like a string of pearls, "Forget it, Director, don't hold her accountable. This is my fault, which led to her revenge against me. If we continue to pursue this, the institute's reputation will suffer because of me, and her future will be ruined."

"Christina, what happened the night before last wasn't intentional. I didn't expect you and William to end up making love by mistake."

"If you want William to marry you and take responsibility, just tell him directly. You don't need to design so many indirect schemes."

Jennifer's voice was hoarse and slow.

With her weak appearance, who wouldn't feel pity?

But her words were deeply hurtful.

The next second, William handed Jennifer a tissue.

He even gently patted her back, "Alright, this has nothing to do with you. Don't cry."

His actions and voice were intimate and doting.

But towards Christina, even if she were to be tortured in front of William, he wouldn't feel a thing.

William spoke coldly, "Christina, you'd better issue a clarification statement now, or you'll regret it!"

Regret?

Her countless compromises in her previous life, that was true regret!

Christina fearlessly met William's cold gaze, "You all keep saying this and that about me. I've already told you how to verify it. Do you have any evidence to prove your innocence? Do you have any evidence that I slandered Jennifer?"

Even though William had broken one of her hands, and it was still in a cast, she wasn't afraid.

William's entire face seemed covered in a dark cloud, and he looked like a demon from hell.

But Christina wasn't afraid.

Today, she would confront them head-on.

After all, William had power and influence. If it turned out not to be her fault, it wouldn't matter.

Unexpectedly, Missy still wouldn't give up, "Christina, stop saying these things. I'm your good friend. If others don't know you, don't I know you? You saw Mr. Cavendish and Ms. Spencer's good relationship, so you replaced Ms. Spencer the night before last. When you saw things weren't going your way, you slandered Ms. Spencer."

"Christina, I know you like Mr. Cavendish a lot, but you have to understand, forced love won't have a good outcome. What's not yours will never be yours."

"Why make yourself so embarrassed and hurt innocent people?"

Missy painted herself as a good person with every word.

In an instant, Christina became the villain.

Missy even apologized to William.

"Mr. Cavendish, I'm sorry. It's my fault for not keeping an eye on Christina, which led her to this point. But Christina did it because she likes you. She didn't mean any harm. Please don't trouble her. The rumors she spread about Ms. Spencer online were all posted from her own account."

"I'm not lying. If you don't believe me, you can check her phone. Her account is full of photos of you, Mr. Cavendish, and her passionate love for you."

Missy was really looking out for her!

Missy even earnestly advised her, "Christina, hand over your phone. Mr. Cavendish won't blame you. They say honesty is the best policy, so don't worry."

Missy assumed she wouldn't hand over her phone, but in reality, Christina opened her phone without hesitation.

On her phone, she only had one Facebook account.

She also only had one Twitter account.

She showed all the pages, including photos, which were all her study notes, with nothing related to William.

Christina said coldly, "Didn't you say all my social media was about William? Now everyone can see, there's nothing."

"And! If you think I spread rumors about you, Jennifer, your people are so capable, just have them trace the IP address, right?"

"And whether you hired someone to write for you, do you think you can prove your innocence with just a few words?"

###chapter 13: Do You Have Evidence That I Love Him?

Jennifer didn't expect that Christina would cling to her so relentlessly.

"With my hand like this, even if I wanted to prove it, I couldn't."

Saying this, Jennifer raised her hand in grievance.

She sobbed softly, "Although I was cyberbullied first and you reported me later, it all happened on the same day. Christina, I have no grudge against you."

Jennifer's pitiful and weak demeanor was now indirectly pointing out that Christina was deliberately scheming!

William, on the other hand, was very taken by Jennifer's act.

He held Jennifer in his arms, but the next second, he looked sharply at Christina.

"Christina, apologize."

Look at that, William and Jennifer now, they really seem like a deeply in love couple.

Christina firmly refused to apologize.

"I did nothing wrong, why should I apologize?" Christina couldn't be bothered to argue with them.

The next second, she took out her phone and directly dialed the police.

Once connected, she was straightforward.

"Hello, officer, I'm in a bit of trouble right now. I'm being falsely accused. I have just reported someone with my real name, but the unit where the person is located is not taking action and even wants to detain me. I am requesting a protection order."

Christina didn't look at William, but she knew that William's eyes were now filled with a desire to tear her apart.

He wanted to protect Jennifer, but she wanted revenge.

All the pain she had suffered in the past, how could she let Jennifer have an easy life in this lifetime?

Jennifer's tears fell like pearls from a broken string, "Christina, haven't you had enough?"

A cold smile crossed Christina's lips, "I'm proving my innocence and trying to eliminate harm from society, how could that be considered causing trouble?"

William's gaze grew colder, "Who do you think you are, Christina, to eliminate harm?"

"Christina, who do you think you are?"

William stood at a towering 6 feet 5.35 inches, wearing a custom black suit, exuding a powerful aura.

He looked down on everyone with disdain, his eyes showing no regard for anyone.

In the past life, William had the same look in his eyes.

William never liked Christina from the beginning, and after that night they got entangled, William hated her even more.

Unfortunately, the foolish her kept thinking that people are not made of stone and would eventually be moved, constantly trying to touch his heart.

A mocking smile crossed Christina's lips, "I don't think I'm anyone special, but protecting my basic rights is my fundamental right as a citizen!"

Christina held her phone with her other hand, meeting William's gaze with an arrogant posture.

She instinctively took a step back, putting some distance between herself and William.

At this moment, she was fully prepared.

As long as William dared to lay a hand on her, she would cry out for help to attract attention.

If they wanted to make her life difficult, then none of them should expect an easy time either!

"Christina, how did you become like this?" Missy said in a voice filled with anguish.

Missy's expression was one of extreme pain.

Christina found it amusing, "Why can't I be like this? I've already proven that I didn't do what you accused me of."

Just last night, after taking a lot of birth control pills and returning to her room, she deleted all the content she had posted on her alternate account about her feelings for William.

Luckily, she deleted it, otherwise, she would have no way to defend herself now.

Missy wanted to say more, but Christina turned away, unwilling to continue the conversation.

The man in the office was extremely troubled.

What a mess this had become!

Soon, the police arrived.

Christina explained everything in detail.

"I only logged into that alternate account last night. I have never posted any harmful messages about Ms. Spencer. As for the real-name report, I am serious."

At the beginning, William broke her hand, trying to trap her in the mansion.

Now, it was time for William to experience her counterattack.

Christina handed her phone to the police.

She also mentioned Jennifer's plagiarism and brought up Missy.

Christina had only one request now, "Officer, I am innocent. Please thoroughly investigate the IP address used by my alternate account."

Christina noticed that after she said this, a flash of panic appeared in Missy's eyes.

And Jennifer wasn't much better off.

She came to resolve this matter, originally intending to use her power and connections.

She didn't expect William to come along.

It would have been fine if he came alone, but seeing William, the people at the architecture institute were all cautious and alert.

She didn't expect Christina to come too.

Especially with others present.

It seemed like Christina was being betrayed, but why did it feel like this was a trap carefully designed by Christina?

Christina deliberately dragged everyone into this.

And Christina's current demeanor, she was calm and composed.

No way.

Jennifer took a step forward, "Christina, you have been stalking me in private, constantly invading my privacy. I can overlook these things. In terms of love, you indeed love William more than I do. But you need to understand, you and William are different, and William doesn't like you."

Jennifer, as expected, with just a few words, pushed her to the forefront.

And William's extremely gloomy face said it all.

He shared Jennifer's thoughts.

Christina coldly stated.

"Jennifer, I am not as despicable as you. I don't like my uncle!"

The term "uncle" immediately caught the police's attention, and they even looked at Christina twice.

Christina didn't show a hint of affection.

A cold and ruthless smile appeared on William's lips, "Christina, you still haven't given up, have you?"

Given up?

From the moment Harper died and her organs were forcibly donated to Mike, her heart had long died.

She would no longer have any affection for William, nor would she hold any illusions!

She coldly said, "I have no feelings for you, nor do I want to make things difficult for myself. I only know that innocence is important."

Christina's attitude was firm, and with William's extreme anger, the people at the architecture institute had no choice but to investigate thoroughly.

Jennifer secretly sent a message to a number.

The police first found that Christina's alternate account was used last night at the Cavendish Mansion.

Today's usage was at Emerald Lakeside in the northern part of the city.

Emerald Lakeside, where Missy lived.

Christina instinctively looked at Missy, whose face turned pale.

Missy's lips trembled, "Christina, I didn't mean anything by it. I just wanted to help you. You've loved Mr. Cavendish for so many years, I didn't want you to end up with nothing."

Missy claimed to help her, to be good to her, but which of her actions wasn't aimed at her demise?

She wasn't a fool, nor was she the foolish Christina of her past life.

Christina's gaze was oppressive, "I love him? Do you have any evidence of my love for him?"

"Evidence." Missy murmured.

Suddenly, Missy pointed out something.

###chapter 14: Christina, do you have anything else to say?

"There is a photo in your album where you secretly took a picture of Mr. Cavendish."

Missy's words made Christina's face suddenly darken.

How could she have forgotten about the online album?

"Phone."

William spoke coldly.

At this moment, the phone was in the hands of the police. His meaning was clear enough; he wanted to check it himself.

He was the undisputed heir of the Cavendish family, the first family of Stargate City, and a business tycoon known for his cunning and power plays.

Who would dare to challenge his authority?

Soon, Christina's phone was handed to William by the police.

William's face was grim as he opened the phone without a word.

He saw the album.

It was a photo of him standing in front of a pond, wearing a gray turtleneck sweater and smoking.

The album was titled "Love of My Life."

Christina's note read: "I have a secret."

The name was William.

William almost threw the phone at Christina, "Christina, what else do you have to say?"

Christina knew that after seeing this, William was even more convinced that she was madly in love with him.

Christina remained calm, "Is it wrong to have a crush when I was young? Besides, there's no law that says you have to love someone forever."

Christina picked up the phone.

Fortunately, only the tempered glass screen protector was broken, otherwise, it would have been another hefty expense.

She then turned to the police, "Officer, you can investigate the public opinion issue yourself. It wasn't me who posted it. As for my real-name report, you can either take me away for investigation now or whatever you see fit. I accept it all."

At this point, what was there to be afraid of?

Before the police could say anything, Jennifer spoke up first, "I have two habits when I paint. My father does have special paints, but how I use them and when I use them is my freedom."

Jennifer's eyes coldly looked at Christina.

The next second, the head of the architecture institute spoke.

"The annual Golden Cup Award is coming up. Your real-name report is just a ploy to enter the competition. I'll give you a chance, and also give Ms. Spencer a chance."

"By then, Ms. Spencer's hand will be healed, and there will be no favoritism. If Ms. Spencer can publicly prove that she didn't use a ghostwriter, then you must apologize to Ms. Spencer and the architecture institute in person."

The Golden Cup Award was indeed not far off.

Jennifer had deliberately injured herself, but how deep could the wounds on her hand be?

However, since the architecture institute had said so, they would wait for the competition and let Jennifer be thoroughly humiliated.

"Fine."

Christina's eyes were full of determination.

Seeing the situation, the police first criticized and educated Missy for her behavior.

"No matter how good your relationship is, you can't insult others online in someone else's name. This is an invasion of privacy and reputation."

"I know I was wrong."

Missy lowered her head.

But the police didn't care about her excuses, "You need to apologize to your friend and Ms. Spencer, not us."

Missy took a deep breath.

She looked at Christina, then at Jennifer.

Compared to Christina's indifference at the moment, Jennifer seemed much gentler.

Missy lowered her head, "Christina, it's all my fault. I meant well but did the wrong thing."

"Ms. Spencer, I'm sorry."

She's apologizing now?

Jennifer found it amusing.

But with so many people around, Jennifer had to maintain her gentle and understanding image.

However, Missy's actions did help her a bit.

She smiled, "You're Christina's friend, and you're still young. This is a misunderstanding, and it's good to clear it up."

A misunderstanding?

Clear it up?

Christina almost laughed out of anger at Jennifer's words.

Jennifer thought that Missy's online exposure was just a convenient opportunity.

Jennifer wanted to push all the blame onto Christina, to make William despise Christina even more.

Jennifer's self-harm and Christina's report, Jennifer's "wounds" from the self-harm conveniently became her shield.

Jennifer must be thrilled.

Christina said coldly, "Don't drag me into everything. I didn't ask you to post it for me."

With that, Christina turned and walked away.

These people could argue all they wanted.

At this point, she couldn't stand to look at them any longer.

"Stop."

William's cold voice commanded.

His voice was authoritative.

Before Christina could react, William walked up to her.

William's hand pressed on her shoulder, "Go back to the villa and stop causing trouble here. I'll deal with you when I get back."

William didn't lower his voice on purpose.

Jennifer and Missy both heard it.

Especially Jennifer, she was incredulous.

"William, you..."

William was referring to Moonlight Citadel, not the Cavendish Mansion.

Even though there was a big scene last night, and Christina's behavior was so disgusting now.

Why would William still let Christina go to his villa?

Christina had such a shameless love for William. Letting her go to his villa would only give her a chance to succeed.

William's thin lips moved slowly, his voice low and stern, "I'll take you back to the hospital."

Other than that, William said nothing else.

Jennifer couldn't argue.

But before leaving, Jennifer gave Christina a deep, resentful look.

Christina's lips curled into a cold smile.

Jennifer was trying to warn her?

No way.

As for William's warning, she wouldn't listen.

Since she had left William's villa, there was no way she would go back.

Christina turned and walked out.

She didn't expect Missy to catch up.

"Christina, wait for me."

The next second, Missy ran up to her.

Christina was indifferent to her, "Get lost."

Missy was at best a small fry, and if they had to break up, so be it.

Besides, she had already fallen out with William and Jennifer. Why would she be afraid of Missy?

Missy tried to grab Christina's hand, "Christina, don't be mad. I just wanted to help you vent your anger. And if I didn't do this, Mr. Cavendish would never know you love him. How long were you going to keep this feeling hidden?"

Missy's eyes were filled with tears.

"You didn't say that before. You kept implying it was my fault. Missy, how can you be so fickle?"

She wasn't deaf, nor had she lost her memory.

She wouldn't show any mercy to Missy.

She didn't let Missy grab her hand.

Missy was stunned. It had only been a day, and Christina seemed like a different person.

"I was doing it for your own good. What status do you have in the Cavendish family? Can you fight against William or Jennifer?"

Missy was now playing the victim and outright slandering her?

Christina wouldn't tolerate it.

###chapter 15: Want to Keep Me as a Caged Bird?

"What I do is my freedom, it has nothing to do with you. Don't you think you're being too nosy?"

Missy was at a loss for words.

Now Christina didn't care about her at all and just started scolding her.

Christina had really changed.

Or was it that Christina couldn't secretly love William, couldn't openly love him, and now she was going crazy?

Seeing Christina walking ahead and distancing herself, Missy immediately caught up.

"Christina, don't be mad. I know I did this without your consent, but we're friends. I was just trying to protect you in a moment of confusion."

Ridiculous.

"You were confused but still knew clearly to protect me, and I should thank you?" Christina continued walking without looking at Missy.

Someone like Missy didn't need to stay by her side anymore.

Missy was speechless.

But to break off with Christina like this?

No way.

She quickly ran in front of Christina, blocking her path, "Christina, don't say things in anger. Aren't you going to participate in the Golden Cup Award?"

"And the annual art competition at school is about to start."

Missy's words reminded Christina of something she hadn't thought of.

With the art competition and the Golden Cup Award, she could definitely make a name for herself in the industry.

Moreover, Missy could be used.

Christina said indifferently, "So what if it starts? What, you want me to help you with your submission?"

Missy was also an art student. Although she wasn't as bad as Jennifer, who hired ghostwriters and took credit for others' work, Missy wasn't much better.

For those better than her, she would find ways to bring them down.

"Of course not. Christina, I was thinking, if you become famous, you can finally hold your head high. You're my best friend, and seeing you succeed would make me very happy."

Christina didn't believe Missy's words.

But since she decided to use Missy, she couldn't be too harsh.

"Missy, I appreciate your thoughts. Next time you want to do something, make sure to tell me first. Help me sign up for the art competition."

"Okay."

In her previous life, Missy didn't help her sign up for the art competition. At that time, she was deeply involved in the William incident and didn't pay much attention to it.

This time!

She would start with these two events and reclaim all her achievements.

William took Jennifer back to the hospital.

The atmosphere in the car was silent, and Jennifer wanted to start a conversation but didn't know how.

It wasn't until William was about to leave after taking her to her room that Jennifer couldn't hold back, "William, are you going back to trouble Christina? I think Christina is just trying to get your attention. If you do something to her and she makes a scene, what will you do?"

Should everyone know that William and Christina had sex?

Then, if Christina played the victim, everyone would sympathize with her, and public opinion would force William to marry Christina.

Just thinking about it made Jennifer feel endless fear.

This time, Christina would benefit, and how could she let Christina become William's woman?

William's mind immediately pictured Christina's cold face, and he said coldly, "I won't let her get that far."

"But hasn't she already? Her friend exposed me online, she reported me, and even called the police." Jennifer's eyes reddened as she spoke.

This sequence of events made it seem like Christina was the mastermind.

And in the architecture department, William hadn't done anything to Christina.

If Christina really made a scene, wouldn't she end up as William's wife?

"William, I'm really afraid of losing you, otherwise, I wouldn't have done this." Jennifer sobbed softly, holding William's hand.

In front of William, Jennifer had always been intellectual, elegant, gentle, and noble.

And calm.

Now, Jennifer was crying weakly, while Christina seemed much calmer.

It was as if they had switched roles.

William's eyes darkened.

"William."

Not hearing a response from William, Jennifer called out softly.

William's thoughts were pulled back, and he said coldly, "I don't blame you. Rest well and prepare for the competition. I have things to do, so I'll go now."

Since William said so, Jennifer could only let go of him understandingly.

Successful men liked obedient women the most, and she couldn't let William dislike her.

She even added considerately, "William, be safe on the road."

"Okay."

William responded lowly and then turned to leave.

After William left, Jennifer immediately took out her phone and made a call.

"I don't care what method you use, get rid of Christina. I want her to disappear from this world completely!"

Mentioning Christina, a fierce look flashed in Jennifer's eyes.

Christina had ruined her plans, and she couldn't let Christina continue to interfere in her and William's world.

And she firmly believed that only dead people wouldn't cause trouble.

Christina didn't return to William's villa, nor did she stay with Missy.

She planned to rent a place off-campus and commute.

Unexpectedly, before she could find a place, Bob appeared with a group of bodyguards, blocking her way.

Christina knew she had no way out, so she didn't struggle and obediently followed Bob, who took her to William.

William was sitting on a leather sofa, legs crossed, holding a cigarette.

His posture was casual and lazy, yet natural.

The moment she stepped into the entrance, William's eyes swept over her coldly.

Christina's heart tightened.

She knew William was here to settle accounts with her.

Instead of waiting for William to speak first, she decided to speak up.

"Uncle, I already explained everything clearly at the architecture department. Now you're still coming after me, don't you think you're being too petty?"

William paused his smoking, a cold smile forming on his lips, "What did I tell you before I left?"

Christina was silent, recalling William's words.

To prevent any issues with the birth control, he wanted her to stay at his villa until he was sure she wouldn't get pregnant before letting her go.

And she had left the villa as soon as he was gone and even reported his favorite person.

Of course, Christina had decided to act and wasn't afraid.

"Uncle, are you trying to keep me caged like a bird?"

###chapter 16 The One I Broke

Christina noticed that after she said that, William's face became even darker.

William even stood up.

He walked towards her step by step, his tall figure suddenly pressing down like a mountain. For a moment, Christina felt like she couldn't breathe.

But she didn't retreat, she couldn't retreat.

"Do you think you have the right?"

William coldly spat out these words.

In an instant, Christina felt like she had been thrown into an ice cellar, shivering from the cold.

Christina chuckled, "Uncle, that's really funny. It's clearly your own idea, and yet you blame me for not having the right."

William's face darkened, and he grabbed Christina's neck.

With great force, Christina's face turned red.

Her eyes were sore and swollen.

Just when she thought William was going to strangle her to death, he suddenly let go of her.

She fell heavily to the ground.

William looked down at her, condescending and arrogant.

"If you don't want to die, shut your mouth."

"Christina, don't think you can get special treatment from me, and don't think I won't dare to kill you."

His words were like sharp daggers, piercing Christina's heart.

In an instant, her heart felt like it was full of holes, bleeding profusely.

"Have you ever treated me specially?"

Even though she was pregnant and gave birth to a daughter, William never treated her differently.

At this moment, William noticed a trace of hatred in Christina's eyes.

William's heart trembled.

Why did Christina have such hatred for him?

At this moment, for some reason, his chest felt like it was being pressed by something, his breathing became heavy and a bit rapid.

"Lock her up."

William turned around and gave the order.

Soon, the bodyguards came to grab Christina.

Several strong men, and Christina now had a broken hand, how could she be their match?

Christina didn't put up a futile resistance.

Unexpectedly, William had another request, "Give me her phone."

Christina didn't expect that William wanted to completely isolate her from the world!

Of course, she wouldn't comply.

But how could she be a match for these people?

They held her tightly, and a maid came to search her, easily taking her phone.

Just as they were handing it to William, her phone rang.

William took a closer look, the contact was labeled "Mom."

Elisa's call.

William signaled the maid to give the phone to Christina and turned on the speaker, "Christina, have you found a place to stay? Where are you?"

William's eyes fell heavily on Christina.

Christina knew what William meant, he didn't want her to say anything reckless.

But if she didn't speak, she would be trapped here by William.

"Mom, I'm trapped at Uncle's place, save me."

The maid reacted quickly, hanging up the call as soon as Christina spoke. The next second, Christina was pressed in front of William by the bodyguards.

William's eyes were sharp, "Christina, do you want to die?"

"I don't want to die."

It was because she didn't want to die, didn't want to be controlled by William here, that she spoke up.

She spoke so quickly, and it was on speaker, her mom must have heard it.

Even if her mom wanted her to be with William, wanted her to marry a good man, she couldn't ignore her now.

"You don't want to die, yet you keep provoking me here. What did you call your mom for, to force a marriage?" William grabbed her cheeks.

William used a lot of force, his eyes sharp, as if he wanted to devour her.

Christina gritted her teeth, "William, what are you talking about? Even if you begged me to marry you, I wouldn't."

"Heh, Christina, you think you can provoke me? Do you think that's possible?" William's grip tightened bit by bit.

Christina coldly laughed, looking at William with more disdain.

William's anger reached its peak, he had only one thought now: to kill Christina.

It was Bob who stepped forward to stop William, "Mr. Cavendish, now that Ms. Windsor has called Mrs. Cavendish for help, if you really kill her, it won't be easy to explain."

If it were an outsider, William could easily deal with it.

But Christina was Elisa's daughter.

Elisa was William's third brother's wife.

Elisa definitely wouldn't ignore Christina now.

William regained some rationality, he let go of Christina, fortunately, there were bodyguards beside her, so she didn't fall to the ground.

William gave the bodyguards a look, "Let her go."

"Christina, with such deep schemes, even if your mom comes, it won't help." William's words were heavy, his whole demeanor domineering and strong.

Christina didn't speak, she looked at William.

William was the same, cold, strong, ruthless, and cruel.

She really didn't understand, in her past life, how she fell in love with William.

Was it because he didn't love her?

Was it because of the halo of him saving her?

She didn't want to argue with William for now.

Meanwhile, Elisa.

After hearing Christina's cry for help and the busy tone from the phone, she realized Christina's situation.

She couldn't ignore her only daughter.

So, she quickly found Raymond.

"Raymond, Christina is at William's place. I just called, she asked me to save her. She only said that and the call was cut off." Elisa couldn't help but cry.

What was all this?

In front of so many people, Christina publicly denied it, and William looked like he wanted to kill someone, who knew when she went to William's place.

Did William do something to Christina?

These were all questions.

Raymond didn't expect this either, he comforted Elisa, "Don't cry, let's go see what's going on."

Although he and Elisa were a remarried couple, over the years, Elisa had taken care of him wholeheartedly.

Even if they didn't have romantic feelings, they had familial affection.

Now that Elisa was so worried, he didn't know what was going on either, it was necessary to go and see.

So, the two of them set off for William's villa.

When they arrived, they saw William sitting on the sofa, legs crossed, lazily smoking, and Christina with a cast on her left hand.

Elisa saw her daughter like this, how could she stay calm, "Christina, what happened to your hand?"

Christina was about to explain, but William coldly spoke, "I broke it."

###chapter 17: Do you think I would do anything to you?

Elisa's heart skipped a beat.

William was so direct!

Elisa could only cast a pleading look at Raymond.

Christina noticed this scene.

William was so arrogant, she feared that the two of them wouldn't be able to take her away.

She was worried.

If she couldn't leave William's side, would she be trapped with him?

"William, didn't we clear things up last night?" Raymond pursed his lips and walked towards William with a stern face.

Although he was the elder brother, the Cavendish family was under William's control.

And William was always decisive, never considering anyone else.

A hint of sarcasm appeared at the corner of William's mouth, "As long as you're not mute, anyone can speak."

Christina understood his meaning very well.

Talking was useless, no matter how much you expressed yourself.

"Uncle, what do you want to do? Ms. Spencer has already admitted to drugging her in this incident, hasn't she?"

"My Christina is innocent too. With such an incident, you're not feeling good, and neither is my Christina. You can't just keep her trapped in your villa forever, can you?"

Elisa knew her place; she couldn't call William "William" like Raymond did.

But if William wanted to be particular, Elisa wasn't qualified to call him that either.

A cold glint flashed in William's eyes, "She has to stay here for at least a month."

A month, to determine if Christina was pregnant.

William wasn't negotiating; he was certain.

Elisa felt a chill in her heart and couldn't say a word.

Raymond was about to say something, but Christina spoke first.

"Half a month is enough. If I'm not found to be pregnant, I can leave."

William squinted, "Are you so sure?"

Elisa was equally shocked.

Christina was only 21 years old and didn't even have a boyfriend.

How could she be so sure about pregnancy tests?

Christina felt a pang in her heart.

She knew because in her previous life, after discovering she was pregnant, the doctor had told her.

Later, she even thought about having another child with William, hoping to use the child to keep William's heart and make the family lively.

Of course, she couldn't tell William and her mother this.

Christina said, "I looked it up. You don't want me to be pregnant, and I don't want to have any contact with you."

"Let her stay here for half a month. How do you plan to explain this to Dad?"

Nicholas was someone who valued reputation the most.

If Christina stayed here, wouldn't some people spread rumors?

William's thin lips curled into a cold smile, "I'll explain to Nicholas. Today, she can't leave."

William was determined to keep Christina.

With that, Christina couldn't leave.

Raymond had no choice, "Alright then. I'll come to pick her up in half a month."

Saying that, Raymond went to pull Elisa.

Elisa didn't want to leave just like that, but what could she do?

She could only instruct Christina.

"You must take good care of yourself here and don't get hurt again."

Christina nodded.

Unexpectedly, Elisa lowered her voice in the next second, "Now that things have come to this, why don't you give it a try? I'll help you. You won't lose out with him."

Elisa thought that with William's status, and Christina not being a member of the Cavendish family, it would be beneficial for Christina to be with William.

Christina was only calling William "Uncle" in name.

If Christina and William got involved, at worst, Christina could live outside.

In Elisa's eyes, being with William had many advantages for Christina.

But the problem was!

Christina had already been with William.

Being with someone you don't love is painful and tormenting.

Christina said coldly, "You can forget about it. I'd rather marry a dog than have anything to do with him."

At least a dog is obedient and loyal.

What does William have?

Is he bad?

"You!" Elisa was choked by Christina's words.

Christina continued, "Even if I stay here for half a month, he can't restrict my freedom. Otherwise, Mom, Raymond, you should stay here too."

William's villa was big enough to accommodate a few more people.

Raymond and Elisa were stunned.

Them staying here, was that appropriate?

William didn't respond, but a faint smile played on his lips.

"Do you think I'll do something to you?"

Christina noticed the disdain in William's eyes.

William had disliked her from the beginning and didn't want any contact with her.

But then again, who knew what might happen when two people were together?

The main point was, William could break her hand and could act against her at any time.

If they had a disagreement, what if he killed her?

She didn't want to die now!

Christina put her plastered hand forward.

"If you didn't do anything to me, then what happened to my hand?"

Christina smiled, "I know you think I'm scheming and hate me. I don't want to be killed by you. Raymond, Mom, you must stay to protect me. Otherwise, how can I face all the rumors?"

Saying this, Christina lowered her head, her voice becoming hoarse and somber.

She looked as if she had suffered a great grievance.

Her eyes seemed to be filled with tears.

Elisa felt this was inappropriate.

If she stayed here and did something, wouldn't William suspect her first?

But if she wasn't here, she would have an alibi.

Raymond also felt it was inappropriate, "Your staying here already raises suspicion. If your mother and I also come here, who knows what others will think."

"Christina, you stay here for half a month. I'll ask for leave for you from school."

Christina hadn't expected this.

Her intention was not to stay here, but her mother and Raymond wanted her to use this half month to prove herself.

Elisa wanted her to make a move on William and marry him.

She really didn't want to have any more ties with William.

She refused, "Why should I take half a month off? Proving I'm not pregnant doesn't conflict with my activities, right?"

"I have my studies and things to do. Besides, I have a competition to participate in."

The Golden Cup Award and the art competition registration were in the next few days.

If her freedom was restricted, how could she register?

Thinking this through, she suddenly realized something.

William did it on purpose, so she couldn't register and let Jennifer prove herself.

In the end, it would be her false accusation.

Thinking of this, Christina immediately got emotional and sneered coldly.

"Uncle, just because you don't want to see Jennifer's true colors doesn't mean others don't. Even if you restrict me, I can still expose her true face!"

###chapter 18: If Nicholas Comes.

William's eyes immediately reflected endless ferocity, "If anything happens to Jennifer, I'll tear you to pieces."

Whether in his past life or this one, the person William cared about the most was always Jennifer.

For Jennifer, he didn't hesitate to say such harsh words to Christina in front of Elisa.

Christina thought of the deceased Harper. Harper was so young, and she had hoped that William could spend more time with her, enduring the pain of illness just to wait for him.

But what did she get in the end?

After she died, her heart was dug out and forcibly donated to Jennifer's son.

"Then you might as well kill me now."

Christina met William's gaze and said calmly.

Seeing the tension rising, Elisa, who was about to leave, immediately went to pull Christina, "Stop talking, what good does it do to provoke your uncle?"

"William, what are you afraid of? It's fine if you want to keep an eye on Christina, but you can't restrict her. What will people think if they find out?"

Raymond pursed his lips and strode forward.

Elisa was now married to him, and Christina was Elisa's daughter.

With Elisa so anxious and the atmosphere so tense, he couldn't just stand by.

William's expression remained indifferent, his gaze still on Christina, "If you don't want to be restricted, you need to learn to behave first."

Christina was amused by this, "You're my uncle, and we have no blood relation. What do I need to learn to behave in front of you for? Do you want to be my father?"

"Christina!"

Elisa's face changed dramatically, and she pulled Christina forcefully.

Christina knew that with William's attitude, Raymond and her mother couldn't take her away. But she wanted her freedom; she couldn't stay in William's villa for half a month without leaving.

Christina's red lips curled, "I'm just stating the facts. I've taken so many birth control pills. Even if there's a one in a million chance, would the child be viable?"

Not to mention that William didn't want her to have a child, she didn't want it either.

An unwanted child would only suffer in this world. Harper was so good, but she couldn't give Harper a complete family or a happy life.

It would be better for Harper to choose someone else as a mother.

Elisa's face was solemn.

Christina was only 21, but she understood so much.

Elisa didn't know how to describe her feelings at that moment.

"People with ulterior motives can do anything. I don't want to talk about the past anymore. Take care of yourself." William threw down these words, not wanting to say another word to Christina.

Christina couldn't leave.

Raymond gave Elisa a look.

Elisa thought that if Christina stayed here and had more contact with William, it wouldn't matter if there were no feelings between them.

As long as they were together, Christina could be the most honorable wife of William.

Elisa held Christina's hand, "Stop arguing with me here, Christina. You need to understand that offending him does you no good."

"Well, not offending him doesn't do me any good either."

What good had she gotten?

She died a miserable death in her past life.

In this life, she had taken so many birth control pills in front of him, but he still didn't believe her and wanted to keep her here by force.

"You! Calm down and think it over. Raymond and I will leave first."

With that, Elisa let go of Christina's hand and left with Raymond.

After Elisa left, Christina turned and went upstairs, leaving William behind.

Unexpectedly, William's cold voice sounded from behind, "Christina, this is the last time. If you don't learn to behave in the future, I'll make you suffer."

William stood with his hands behind his back, looking down on her with arrogance.

William hated Christina's presumptuousness, and Christina equally hated his condescension, "If you really want me dead, then kill me now. Stop talking about the future. Besides, if I really die, I'll make sure you get hurt too. What will happen to Jennifer if something happens to you?"

Christina became more and more pleased with herself, "If you die, Jennifer will probably follow you in death."

She didn't care about William's expression anymore.

After all, if she angered him to death, she wouldn't be held responsible.

Elisa was preoccupied.

She thought that leaving Christina here was the best opportunity, but she needed to find the right moment.

However, William's methods were swift and decisive. If he found out she had meddled, it might affect her position in the Cavendish family.

Unexpectedly, Raymond had already seen through her thoughts and said softly, "It's best not to provoke William, or it will be endless trouble."

"I didn't, I just think Christina..." Elisa's breath caught, and the more she thought about it, the more upset she became.

Bringing Christina into the Cavendish Mansion was supposed to be a way to escape their previous poverty, but Christina wasn't welcomed in the Cavendish family at all.

She thought Christina could have a better future after finishing her studies and marrying well. Instead, she got entangled with William. She could have stayed by William's side and at least had money, but Christina didn't want any of it.

She wanted to worry about Christina, but she didn't expect Raymond to see through her.

Raymond held her hand, gently rubbing her hand with his thumb, "Don't worry, once William's concerns are gone, we'll bring Christina back. If Christina doesn't want to stay in the Cavendish Mansion, we'll find her a place outside."

"Okay."

Although Elisa knew Raymond would keep his word, the problem was, who could compare to William's status?

But she was also wary of William. If Nicholas found out about Christina being with William, it wouldn't be her fault.

So, she bribed a servant.

During dinner at the Cavendish Mansion, the servant asked her, "Mrs. Elisa Cavendish, I know a few hundred dollars isn't much. But to me, a few hundred dollars is my expenses for several days. Ms. Windsor hasn't been seen, and she said she'd give it to me soon. Where did Ms. Windsor go?"

Elisa was satisfied but still put on an act, "I know it's difficult for you, so you brought it up. Don't worry, I'll give you the money soon."

The next moment, a cold voice sounded, "Is it really a few hundred dollars not given? Or is it intentional? Besides, if Christina isn't home at this critical moment, where else could she be? I think she's probably with William!"

These words came from Raymond's second brother's wife, Gabrielle Hughes, who always made things difficult for Elisa.

###chapter 19: You're Neither My Dad Nor My Husband

"What nonsense are you spouting!" Elisa's face changed dramatically.

Gabrielle laughed coldly, "Nonsense? I think someone is clearly feeling guilty!"

The next second, she changed her tone, "Why don't we just follow up and check it out?"

"Gabrielle."

Elisa called out her name.

But what use was Elisa's anger?

Gabrielle completely ignored Elisa, and Elisa never expected that Gabrielle would become a driving force in achieving her plan.

But these words had already deeply impacted Nicholas.

Nicholas's face darkened, "Go check Christina's whereabouts..."

"Dad! If you investigate like this, William is also a formidable person. Why not just conduct a surprise inspection?"

"No way!"

Gabrielle interrupted Nicholas, and Elisa strongly opposed Gabrielle's words. Gabrielle smiled triumphantly, "No way, no way, why not?"

"After all, Christina is still with William!"

Gabrielle said heavily.

Now Nicholas had lost his appetite. He immediately gave orders and took people to William's villa.

He didn't inform anyone before coming. At the Cavendish Mansion, Gabrielle kept an eye on Elisa, giving her no chance to tip anyone off.

But Elisa had no intention of tipping anyone off.

Raymond, on the side, had already seen through everything but chose to remain silent.

When Nicholas arrived at William's villa, William was in the study. Nicholas didn't allow any servants to disturb William and led a surprise inspection himself.

When he saw Christina in the room, Nicholas was instantly furious.

"What is the meaning of this? What are you doing here?"

Christina didn't expect Nicholas to come.

However, she could only get out of bed now, or else Nicholas might have his bodyguards drag her out of bed, which would be too humiliating.

Christina stood opposite Nicholas, calm and composed, "The reason I'm here, Grandpa, you should ask Uncle."

"I let her stay here. As for the birth control pills, who knows if they're real or not."

A faint voice came from behind Nicholas.

Nicholas turned around to see William striding over, his expression indifferent and cold, showing no sign of panic at being discovered.

Nicholas's eyes were cold, "Aren't you afraid of this being spread around? Do I need to spell out what your relationship is?"

"My relationship with her is none of the Cavendish family's business." William said coldly, not even glancing at Christina.

He didn't care about Christina at all.

In other words, Christina was not part of the Cavendish family.

Christina understood William's meaning clearly and had no intention of arguing with him.

But now that Nicholas was here, he could take her away.

Christina said softly, "Since I'm not part of the Cavendish family, why am I being restricted? What right do you have to control me?"

"Grandpa, even if the birth control pills are fake, I've taken so many. Even if I am pregnant, I'm still in Stargate City, aren't I?"

She was in Stargate City and couldn't run away.

If she was really pregnant, they could force her to the hospital and have it terminated, couldn't they?

"You absolutely cannot be pregnant, and she cannot stay here. The Cavendish family cannot withstand such rumors." Nicholas said, leaning on his cane, his black suit adding to his current authority.

William said indifferently, "The Cavendish family is powerful. We are the main characters in this matter, and I will decide her fate."

William was indeed William. No matter who stood before him, he remained indifferent and unyielding.

Christina used to like this trait in him, but now?

To hell with it!

"You're not my father, nor my husband. Why should you decide?"

Christina's words immediately drew everyone's attention.

Nicholas's face turned extremely ugly, "Do you have any right to speak here?"

"I may not have the right to speak, but didn't Uncle just say? We are the main characters in this matter. This is between him and me."

"But it's not just up to Uncle. Even if I say these words outside, I'm still right." Christina said arrogantly, calmly.

The next second, Christina thought of leaving, but William stepped forward, blocking her path.

His tall figure was as imposing as a mountain.

Christina felt nothing but irritation and disgust.

"Uncle, no matter who stands in front of you now, you won't let me go, will you?"

William's thin lips opened coldly, "Half a month hasn't passed yet. I won't allow any accidents."

These words made Christina particularly resentful, "Then I think it's better if you kill me, dismember me, and bury me. That way, my womb won't carry your child, and I won't appear before you again."

With so many pills, what could go wrong?

"Do you think I don't dare?" William's eyes flashed with a fierce glint.

William was cold and ruthless, capable of going to such lengths.

Christina knew he was not to be trifled with, but with Nicholas here, William wouldn't kill her.

The most important point was that she could make William unhappy.

Christina smiled, "I know you dare, but you haven't done it yet. Uncle, I didn't drug you. Your beloved first love has already admitted it. Why trouble me?"

"With your behavior, it's hard not to suspect you're addicted to making love to me and want to be with me." Christina's words were almost provocatively challenging.

William's face darkened with a thick layer of displeasure.

Christina smiled silently.

Nicholas hated the Cavendish family's reputation being tarnished. He had long planned William's marriage.

As the head of the Cavendish family, the person he married had to be of equal status.

Jennifer was just from a family of scholars. What was that?

He didn't approve of Jennifer, and now there was Christina.

And William still had this attitude.

Nicholas's anger surged, "Are you two done? Am I dead to you now? Do my words carry no weight?"

Nicholas's series of questions were almost roars.

William and Christina remained silent.

But William's attitude was clear, "Half a month is the best time to prove it, and it was you, Christina, who suggested it."

"Then I'll stay here?"

Nicholas's face was cold.

Killing, dismembering, and removing the womb were all out of the question!

###chapter 20 Even if Public Opinion Arises, the One Marrying Christina is Me

Elisa is still Nicholas's son's wife, and Christina is the child she brought along.

So many years have passed, if they don't see each other for a short period, wouldn't others think that the Cavendish family lacks tolerance?

Moreover, it was Jennifer who drugged, and it was William and Christina who had sex.

Christina is only 21 years old and is William's niece by status.

If this gets out, the Cavendish family's reputation will be ruined.

William's voice was very cold, "Why did you move in?"

Christina had no interest in their argument.

"Grandpa, you and Uncle can talk slowly, I'll leave first." Christina originally wanted to slip away directly, but Nicholas was still standing there.

Her mother was still in the Cavendish family.

She should show some respect to Nicholas.

But when William said she couldn't leave, he really meant it.

William blocked her way, and that wasn't enough, he even grabbed her wrist tightly, restraining her.

Nicholas saw this scene, and his blood pressure shot up.

William was also a stubborn person, he had to see for himself.

But Christina wasn't wrong, even Christina could think that William was addicted to her, let alone others.

He walked over to Christina with a gloomy face.

"You all go out, I need to talk to Christina."

Nicholas's face didn't look good, and Christina knew that whatever Nicholas had to say to her, it wouldn't be good.

And the people Nicholas brought immediately went to get William.

William didn't care.

In any case!

Christina couldn't leave through that door.

Soon, only Nicholas and Christina were left in the room.

Christina wasn't in a hurry to speak.

Nicholas looked at Christina and said in a low voice, "You see the current situation, if you continue to stay here and it gets exposed, it won't be good for you, William, or the Cavendish family."

Christina made her stance clear, "It's not that I want to stay here. Grandpa, I don't accept going abroad, my studies are here, I grew up in Stargate City."

"You don't have to leave, but if you have your uterus removed, I can compensate you."

Hearing the words "have your uterus removed," Christina laughed in anger.

But she waited for Nicholas to finish speaking.

Christina chuckled softly, "How much do you think is appropriate, Grandpa?"

Nicholas didn't speak, already thinking about the amount in his mind.

Before Nicholas could speak, Christina said calmly, "You give me five million dollars, five million dollars is a lot for me, but I'm young, I haven't even graduated from college yet."

"In the future, I can have a job, I can earn money with my own hands. In the future, I will get married and have children, Grandpa, you have seven children, who knows if I will have eight or ten in the future?"

"If the price of a child's life is ten million dollars, how much would ten be? Moreover, my children can have children, and their children can have children, how much value is that?"

Nicholas's face turned dark.

If calculated according to Christina, the value would be infinite.

Nicholas said coldly, "You can't calculate it like that."

Christina's smile remained, "Why not? A person's value is infinite, especially for a woman. To put it bluntly, from ancient times to the present, some women without jobs, their only value is to have children, right?"

Without a uterus, can a woman still be considered a woman?

Look, Nicholas didn't speak, clearly agreeing with Christina's words.

Christina's lips curled into a mocking smile, "Grandpa, in your eyes, you agree that a woman's value is like this. So why should I exchange my most valuable thing with you? Besides, I'm the one who got hurt, I haven't even asked Uncle to compensate me, I've made my stance clear, why still press me?"

Christina's words made Nicholas's face stiffen.

He was so old, yet he was being lectured by Christina here.

Moreover, Christina was indeed the one who was wronged, and he couldn't refute what she said.

"Grandpa, Uncle said I must stay here. But I am free, as his father, if you don't even have this bit of authority, then you are really old."

Christina said these words on purpose.

Nicholas cared about reputation, right?

Then she would find problems with reputation, she didn't believe Nicholas could remain indifferent.

Sure enough, Nicholas's face became more and more unpleasant.

Nicholas didn't say anything, he left the room with his cane.

Outside the door were Nicholas's bodyguards and William.

Nicholas walked up to William with a gloomy face, "We all thought this was Christina's problem at first, but Jennifer admitted it."

"You're old enough, don't you know who's really at fault here?"

William certainly knew.

He was Christina's uncle in name, and he had sex with Christina, so it was his problem.

And Christina had made her stance clear, he shouldn't keep holding on to Christina.

But!

Was Christina really innocent?

Why was Christina there?

Christina even said she liked William?

Christina reported Jennifer, Christina said so many rebellious things, wasn't Christina deliberately provoking?

If he let Christina go, and she got pregnant, or she talked nonsense outside, creating a situation where he had to marry Christina.

William didn't want to see that happen, "I know very well, that's why I have to keep Christina here. Dad, I'm an adult, I know what I'm doing."

"Even if there's public opinion in the end, the one who has to marry Christina is me."

"You, you, you!"

Nicholas almost couldn't catch his breath.

William glanced at the bodyguards, "Send my dad back to the Cavendish Mansion."

"Yes."

The bodyguards were also afraid of Nicholas having an accident, and given the current situation, it was safer to take Nicholas away.

After the bodyguards took Nicholas away, William walked into the room with a gloomy face.

Christina was sitting on the sofa, waiting, but when she saw William walk in, she realized the whole problem.

"Didn't expect Uncle to really be so obsessed with me. Uncle, do you think in the end you'll go against everyone and marry me?"

"You really think so." William stared coldly at Christina, "Christina, is this your real goal?"

Christina's lips curved into a sneer, "Are you a worm in my stomach to know my thoughts?"

###chapter 21: You Think You Deserve to Call My Name?

William didn't say anything, but his expression was visibly unpleasant.

What was she talking about?

Unexpectedly, the next second Christina started pulling at her clothes, "Uncle, I have a habit of sleeping naked. If you don't leave, are you planning to relive our lovemaking?"

"Shut up!"

William angrily rebuked her, turned around, and left, not wanting to see Christina for another second.

Christina's eyes were filled with even more sarcasm.

William didn't want to see her, but did she want to see William?

After William left, she immediately locked the door.

She had plans for tomorrow and needed to conserve her energy. She didn't want anyone to disturb her.

Without any interruptions, Christina had a good night's sleep.

In the morning, she got up and went downstairs after tidying up.

The servants had already prepared breakfast.

She walked to the dining table and sat down, but the servant said, "Mr. Cavendish hasn't come downstairs yet."

In other words, she couldn't eat breakfast until William arrived.

Christina didn't care, "I'm not a servant in this villa, and if I'm here and my freedom is restricted for three meals a day, why force me to stay here?"

Christina started eating.

She wasn't money; she didn't need everyone to like her.

In short, she didn't need to please anyone.

If someone couldn't stand her and tried to harm her, she would fight back.

The servant couldn't drive Christina away from the table.

However, when William appeared, the servant complained about Christina's behavior, "Mr. Cavendish, Ms. Windsor has no manners at all. I made it very clear to her."

With a single look from William, the servant obediently retreated.

Christina sat leisurely at the dining table, completely ignoring everyone around her.

William walked over with a dark expression.

Christina happened to put down her fork and stand up.

She ignored William, but unexpectedly, William spoke against her, "Why don't you have any manners?"

"You're not my father, and this isn't my home. Besides, even in the Cavendish Mansion, did following the rules for so many years do any good?" Christina found it amusing.

She had been in the Cavendish family for so many years without receiving equal respect, and now William was interfering with her freedom.

What was he planning?

Was he treating her as a daughter or grooming her as a perfect wife?

William said coldly, "Christina, you're on my turf now."

"Ha?" Christina retorted unceremoniously, "It's not like I wanted to come to your turf. Besides, if you don't talk to me for a day, do you feel uncomfortable?"

William's handsome face was instantly clouded with gloom.

"Christina, do you have a death wish?"

No one had ever dared to speak to him like that.

When William got angry, everyone around him trembled.

Christina knew what William was like, so if she didn't run now, when would she?

But she couldn't outrun William.

William grabbed her wrist and pulled her back with force.

Christina didn't expect him to do that, and her lower back hit the dining table, causing intense pain to shoot through her entire back.

"William, are you crazy?"

In her previous life, she died because of him, and her daughter was gone too. In this life, she had swallowed pills and broken her hand. Did William want to kill her before he would be satisfied?

William's eyes were cold, "Christina, do you think you deserve to call my name?"

Christina had called his name more than once or twice.

Did she really think he was easy to bully?

"Isn't your name William? And you haven't acknowledged me as your niece. If you did, would you still harm me?"

Christina's words were cold and sharp.

Christina's words were never forgiving.

"If you want to be mute, I can make that happen."

At this moment, William's face was extremely displeased.

Moreover, William didn't seem to have any intention of letting go of her hand.

Seeing William's stance, he really wanted to make her mute and even torture her.

A smart person knows when to back down. It's time to lower her head.

Christina softened her attitude, "I don't want to be mute. I want to go out now. Uncle, please let me go. Just consider it as me throwing a tantrum."

William sneered coldly, "What right do you have to throw a tantrum here?"

William was high and mighty, looking down on everyone.

In William's eyes, she had no rights at all. She wasn't even considered a person. Jennifer was the one who could throw tantrums.

"No matter what I say, you don't believe me. Shouldn't I have emotions?" Christina struggled but couldn't break free from William's grip.

Christina was both angry and helpless.

William didn't let go at all.

In the end, Christina had to bring up Jennifer, "If you don't let go, your first love will come and see us, and she'll think we have a problem. Then she'll make a scene, and you better not blame it all on me."

Mentioning Jennifer finally caused a change in William's expression.

However, William still warned Christina, "Don't even think about hurting her again. If anything happens to her, I won't let you off."

In both her past and present lives, Jennifer was always the most important person in William's eyes.

He wouldn't let her off?

Christina felt a pang in her heart, "You never let me off. If you did, I wouldn't be here. Uncle, you really should understand that I'm not the one at fault."

Jennifer was the one who drugged him, and Christina was the one who got hurt. She had swallowed so many birth control pills.

Even if William didn't care about her life, didn't he know that all drugs are toxic?

Taking so many pills, even if she miraculously got pregnant, would the child be healthy?

"If it wasn't you, then why were you there?"

William pursed his lips and coldly threw out the question.

This was the question William had never asked back then.

Even if he was drugged, Christina was sober. He didn't ask because Jennifer and everyone else were present.

Christina's throat tightened because of William's question, pulling her thoughts back to that day.

William was drugged, and she was sober.

From initial resistance to eventual compliance, she just wanted to help him.

She had given him her most precious first time, but he never thought of compensating her. Instead, he thought she was scheming?

A bad man's heart could never be moved.

Christina's lips curled into a sarcastic smile, "Does a person need a reason to be somewhere?"

###chapter 22: About to Be Fired

"At that time, in that place, and with everything your best friend Missy exposed, Christina, who do you think you're fooling?" William's anger grew as he spoke.

Some things can't be delved into too deeply, or they'll all become problems.

But.

William was angry, and Christina was equally furious. "I'm not treating anyone like a fool, but you shouldn't assume everyone is a scheming woman either."

"At least up until now, I haven't gained any benefits. But you, you took away my precious first time having sex. I didn't even ask you to take responsibility, and here you are, overthinking everything. William, are you paranoid?"

Christina would never have dared to say such things to William in the past.

But she had already died once.

In this life, if she didn't stand up for herself, was she supposed to let herself be oppressed and die again?

She wasn't willing.

"I'll say it again, I have no interest in you. If you keep this up, I'll really suspect you're just looking for an excuse to get close to me."

Christina struggled, and seeing that William still wouldn't let go, she didn't care anymore and bit down on William's hand.

William hadn't expected Christina to bite him, and his eyes grew even colder. "Christina, are you a dog?"

Christina didn't let go.

It wasn't until she tasted a strong metallic flavor of blood in her mouth that she finally released her grip.

William's wrist now bore a row of bloody teeth marks.

Christina glared fiercely at William, now truly resembling a cornered, angry little beast.

"You wouldn't let go. William, don't provoke me any further, or I'll set your house on fire. At worst, we'll go down together!"

She had already said her harsh words; what happened next was William's problem.

"Get out!"

William roared in anger.

Christina didn't respond and quickly ran forward.

She practically sprinted out of William's villa.

She needed to walk a bit further to catch a cab.

After hailing a cab at a landmark intersection, Christina instructed the driver to head straight to the school.

Unexpectedly, when she arrived at the school, people avoided her.

When she got to her class, none of her classmates would look her in the eye.

Until the teacher arrived. Christina didn't believe Missy could have registered her, so she went to the teacher to register herself. But to her surprise, the teacher's expression was not friendly.

"I was just looking for you. Since you're here, let's talk about your problem."

Christina frowned. "Teacher, what problem could I have?"

Whether it was exams or competitions, she always relied on her own abilities. In class, she never had conflicts with her classmates.

The teacher patted the desk. "You have the nerve to ask me? Christina, as a student, don't you know to respect your elders and maintain order?"

"Look at the mess you've caused online. What normal person would like their elders? You're affecting the school and the class too much. You should take a break from school."

Online, it was Jennifer who was being scolded, and Jennifer who drugged William.

She hadn't even defended herself yet, and now the public opinion had turned into insults against her?

However, in front of the teacher, Christina didn't speak as sharply as she did with William.

Christina calmly said, "Teacher, if you look closely at the public opinion, you'll see that this isn't my fault."

"Jennifer was the one who drugged William. I was just inadvertently involved with William. And I'm the victim here."

Christina spoke clearly, "Teacher, why don't you stand by your student and consider my side? I haven't gained any benefits. Besides, even if it was me, what does my private life have to do with the school? The people spreading my business are the real culprits!"

She hadn't said a word online to defend herself, while Jennifer was crying and threatening suicide, and Missy was the one who exposed everything first.

How was this her fault?

The teacher didn't care about any of that. "If you're feeling wronged, you can go to the police for help. But you shouldn't be causing all this public opinion and affecting everyone."

Christina realized that registering today was impossible.

But she wasn't going to drop out.

"If you want me to drop out, you should give me a legitimate reason. I'm clearly the victim here. Otherwise, I'll take this matter to the education department." Christina didn't want to be at odds with a teacher.

But given the teacher's attitude, Christina knew she had to say something harsh.

The teacher wasn't afraid of Christina's threat. "You're a problem student, affecting the school and the class. It's normal to ask you to take a break. Besides, this isn't compulsory education; the school has every right to expel you!"

With things said to this point, Christina felt she had nothing to lose.

She chuckled. "You're just a homeroom teacher. The dean and principal haven't said anything. Who gave you the right to expel me?"

"That's none of your business. But starting today, you don't need to come anymore. Go to the dean's office to complete the formalities." The teacher didn't want to say anything more to Christina.

Christina couldn't bear this injustice.

She immediately called the education department.

Unexpectedly, the education department sided with the school, even using the same tone, saying she was a problem student and the school's decision to expel her was reasonable.

The education department wouldn't help?

Christina then took the matter online.

She hadn't wanted to go this far, but they forced her hand. So, she didn't mind making a bigger deal out of it.

She even added a striking headline: "I'm the one who got hurt, so why do I have to pay for everything?"

Online, she briefly summarized her experiences with William, including the argument with William and Missy at the architecture institute.

The post quickly garnered a lot of comments.

"No way? Is the poster really this miserable? She lost her virginity and everything. I hope she doesn't end up with no way out."

"What kind of society is this? There's no way she'll have no way out."

"She lost her virginity, her education, and now she's being blamed for everything online. Isn't this just pushing her to the edge?"

"Oh my god! When you put it that way, it's really terrifying!"

"Why are we still here? The most we can do is say a few words online. The poster should call the police!"

"Exactly, call the police, don't wait!"

###chapter 23: Are You Ordering Me?

More and more public opinion, this is exactly the effect Christina wanted.

She even deliberately picked a few popular comments to reply to: "I am a burden, and in the Cavendish family, my status is even more humble. What right do I have to speak? Even if I call the police now, I'm afraid it won't help. I feel really miserable, I just want to go to school properly."

"Architecture school, I know about it too. Should I just watch hypocritical people become the pillars of the nation? I didn't know before, but now that I do, I can't go against my conscience and pretend I don't know."

"I feel so helpless right now, I don't know what to do."

Netizens gave her advice, "Contact the relevant national departments. This is a national institution, can they really allow incompetent people to steal others' achievements and become successful?"

This was a good idea.

But Christina now wanted to see what effect these posts would have.

Unexpectedly, her phone rang with a landline number.

"Christina, delete those things online immediately!"

"Who is this?"

Judging by the tone, it should be a school leader.

Christina guessed right, "What you posted online has a huge impact on the school. Your class teacher was also thinking about the school and the bigger picture."

"The trouble you've caused, doesn't our school have the right to deal with you?"

"Or, has the education bureau not given you a clear response?"

Every word was forceful, as if trying to pin eighteen charges on Christina.

Christina wouldn't accept this, "What did I post online? The recent posts were because I felt unfairly treated. I didn't do those things, I had nothing to do with William, yet the school wants to expel me, and the education bureau doesn't care. Can't I legally protect my rights if I don't want to drop out?"

"It's all been exposed, and you still claim you have nothing to do with your uncle William? Who would believe that? Christina, I've warned you, if you don't listen, we will have to take certain measures."

"Then I'll see it through to the end."

She didn't care what measures the school would take.

In any case, she wouldn't drop out.

There were many comments online, but soon they couldn't be displayed anymore.

Christina sent messages to the relevant national departments, but there was no response at all.

She could only call the complaint hotline, and the person in charge told her, "We will investigate your report according to the law. However, the school has the right to deal with problematic students."

Hearing this, Christina was almost furious.

The school has the right to deal with problematic students.

So was all her effort in vain?

She didn't care.

She called each department one by one, determined to get a result today.

Unexpectedly, Missy was still trying to persuade her, "Christina, you should stop. Haven't you heard the saying, 'the people can't fight the government'? You can't win."

Can't win? She was determined to fight.

But with no leads, she had to contact the media and personally take them to the Cavendish Corporation to confront William.

She remembered William's number.

But when William saw an unknown number on his phone, he frowned, "Who is this?"

His private number was never given out.

Anyone who could call this number must know it and have something important.

Christina calmly said, "Uncle, I'm now with the media outside the Cavendish Corporation building. Come down and let's make a public clarification."

She and the media were outside the Cavendish Corporation building, William couldn't avoid showing up.

William wondered who it was, his eyes filled with endless coldness and danger, "Are you ordering me?"

"I'm not trying to order you, but now there's a rumor that you and I are involved. Because of you, I can't go back to school."

Christina gripped her phone tightly, "They even asked me to put it on speaker, but I didn't. Do you want the media to dig into our relationship..."

Christina deliberately left the sentence unfinished.

William was a smart man, he would understand what she meant.

But William's face turned extremely grim, what was this?

Christina not only got his number but also put him in an awkward situation and threatened him to show up.

A deeper coldness crossed William's lips, "You're not qualified to threaten me."

"You're right. But you should understand the meaning of rumors. I'll wait for you, hurry up." With that, Christina hung up without waiting for William's response.

William's face instantly darkened as if covered by a shadow, his eyes sharp and cold.

No one had ever dared to speak to him like this, to threaten him like this.

Bob saw William's expression and hesitated to speak, "Mr. Cavendish, should I handle this?"

The only person who could make William this angry was Christina. But now, Christina was facing the risk of being expelled from school.

William's voice was deep and heavy, "Come downstairs with me."

"Yes."

Bob didn't know what William was thinking, but he followed William's orders.

Christina, on the other hand, was facing the reporters.

"You can start now."

But the reporters didn't see William, "Ms. Windsor, didn't you say Mr. Cavendish would be here for this clarification press conference?"

They were waiting for William!

After all, William's reputation in Stargate City was well-known.

Even if William and Christina didn't make any clarifications, news about them would still make headlines.

Moreover, they could interview William about other things.

But now, with William not showing up, they were reluctant to start.

Christina remained calm, "I've already called my uncle, he'll be here soon."

She had said everything she needed to. William would definitely come to avoid any online scandal.

"Then let's wait for Mr. Cavendish to arrive before starting!"

The reporters insisted on waiting for William to appear.

But as time passed and William still hadn't shown up, some people started to get impatient, "Ms. Windsor, are you lying to us?"

"Did Mr. Cavendish not agree to come?"

"Aren't you wasting everyone's time?"

"No wonder you wanted us to start first. If Mr. Cavendish doesn't come, we'll pack up and leave!"

The reporters were getting restless, and Christina felt that if they left, all her efforts would be in vain.

Christina tried to calm them down while calling William, "Don't worry, I'll call my uncle right now."

###chapter 24 The Reporters

The reporters didn't believe Christina's words and started packing up their things, ready to leave.

What they didn't expect was that the sound of a phone ringing came closer and closer.

The reporters who were about to leave turned back excitedly and shouted, "It's Mr. Cavendish!"

In just a few seconds, the reporters returned to their positions. They set up their equipment and aimed their high-definition cameras at William and Christina.

Christina hung up the phone, put it away, and walked over to William.

Christina smiled sweetly, "Uncle, you scared everyone. We all thought you wouldn't come."

William gave the reporters a look, signaling that they could start.

The reporters, understanding the cue, slowly began, "Mr. Cavendish, with the rampant online reports about you and Ms. Windsor, have you and Ms. Windsor really had a sexual relationship as reported?"

"Mr. Cavendish, are you not planning to take responsibility?"

"Ms. Windsor is facing these issues now, Mr. Cavendish, are you not going to help her?"

These questions were extremely grating to William.

Christina found it even more laughable. Between her, William, and Jennifer, it was at most just public opinion and trending topics.

But now, in the eyes of the reporters, it had become newsworthy?

These people really knew how to find a topic, no wonder they were reporters.

Before Christina could say anything, William coldly retorted, "Did any of you see me having sex with Christina?"

William's words were straightforward and direct.

The reporters fell silent.

Christina added with a smile, "Since none of you saw me with my uncle, and there is no evidence, don't make baseless claims. Otherwise, we will hold you legally responsible."

"By the way, my uncle and I are just simply uncle and niece. Stop spreading rumors. And I am not messing around. I will continue my studies as usual."

"Uncle, they always like to spread rumors."

Christina lowered her head, her voice hoarse with a hint of grievance.

The reporters, including Bob, could see it.

Christina wanted to use this opportunity to clarify things. The reporters, wary of William's power, didn't dare to say much.

But they had only asked a few questions.

The situation was completely controlled by Christina and William, which was unacceptable.

So, a reporter asked again.

"Mr. Cavendish, Ms. Windsor, if you don't have that kind of relationship, why would someone expose it at this critical moment?"

"And Jennifer, why would she think of drugging you, Mr. Cavendish?"

"Ms. Windsor was at the scene, wasn't she? With your uncle-niece relationship, Ms. Windsor could call you over with just one phone call. Are you really not involved?"

These reporters, relying on the live broadcast, just wanted news.

No matter, they would deal with it as it came.

With William by her side, Christina didn't believe he wouldn't take action.

William's expression was extremely grim, as if covered by a thick layer of gloom.

Christina's sharp words were one thing, but now these people dared to talk nonsense in front of him.

"Then why are you here?" William threw out a question, leaving them speechless.

The reason they were here was to get newsworthy topics, wasn't it?

But this was a live broadcast, they couldn't just say that.

Before they could respond, William continued, "You're not police officers. Are you investigating a case with such detailed questions?"

"Christina and I are standing here responding. If we say there's no relationship, then there's no relationship. This is my final response. If similar news appears in the future, I will hold you legally responsible."

Christina added, "Did you hear that? Remove those trending topics immediately, stop the online attacks and rumors about me, and relevant departments, stop interfering with my personal matters."

She looked directly at the camera, scanning the reporters in front of her.

Such a straightforward statement had a good effect through the live broadcast.

William turned around, not wanting to respond any further.

Seeing him leave, Christina quickly followed, "Uncle, I haven't paid the reporters yet. Can you help me with that? I'm just a student, I don't have much money."

William's anger surged, but he couldn't lose his temper.

He coldly instructed Bob, "Bob, stay and handle this."

"Yes."

Bob then walked towards the group of reporters.

Christina pretended to follow William, and they entered the elevator together. William pressed the button for the 39th floor.

Christina pressed the button for the basement level.

William narrowed his eyes, a fierce look in them, "Threatening me, using me, Christina, you have some nerve."

At the same time, William took a step forward.

The elevator space was small, and Christina instinctively tried to avoid him, but she ended up being pinned against the elevator wall.

"What, can't look at me?" William sneered.

He reached out and pinched Christina's chin, forcing her to look up.

With such force, Christina couldn't push William away.

She was forced to look up, seeing William's face full of anger.

The fierceness in William's eyes seemed like he wanted to tear her apart.

"It's not that I don't dare, but Uncle, we're in your company's elevator. If there's a mole in your company, we'll be trending again."

"At that time, it won't be easy to explain with just words."

Christina maintained her smile. At such a close distance, William's handsome features were magnified in front of her, and the smell of tobacco and male hormones from him hit her senses.

Christina wasn't afraid, she just didn't want to.

"Isn't it you who dragged me into this? Christina, where did you get my phone number?" William tightened his grip.

In an instant, Christina's features twisted in pain.

Christina smiled lightly, even though her words were unclear, "Don't forget, my mom is your third brother's wife. Is it difficult for me to get your number?"

William's number, she remembered it clearly from her past life.

Later, when Harper was sick, she called him repeatedly. Sometimes he answered, sometimes it was someone else.

"Uncle, it's not that I want to drag you into this, but we are the ones involved in this incident. If something happens to me, can you escape responsibility? I just want to go to school, nothing more."

Christina didn't like this position.

###chapter 25 Stop Disgusting Me

Christina grabbed his wrist and felt the bite mark she had made.

William frowned, "Is it really not there, or are you just pretending, Christina? You know the truth yourself."

Christina immediately got angry.

He always spoke to her in that tone, didn't he?

Christina let go of his hand and then wrapped her arms around his neck, "Didn't you say I have feelings for you? Fine, come on, satisfy my feelings."

As she spoke, Christina moved to kiss William on the lips.

William wasn't going to let her succeed.

At the moment she leaned in, William pushed her away in disgust, "Stop disgusting me."

"You know I'm doing it on purpose to disgust you. Then why do you keep saying I have feelings for you? With all the rumors outside, how am I supposed to clear things up?"

Christina held back the anger surging inside her.

She had only one thought now, which was to have no contact with William. This way, she could pass the competition first, then gradually stabilize her career and become a career-oriented woman.

William's brow furrowed deeply.

He knew exactly what Christina meant; she was trying to drag him into this mess.

"Get away from me. If this happens again, Christina, you know the consequences." William turned around, but the look of disgust in his eyes was clear to Christina.

Consequences?

William only knew how to suppress people in this way.

"Now that it's clarified, if anyone dares to report recklessly, it means they're your enemies. If you can't even deal with your enemies, what else is there to say?"

Christina immediately stepped aside. She didn't want any contact with William and was afraid he might suddenly turn around and hit her.

Sure enough, William's sharp gaze fell on her.

His eyes were filled with endless anger.

Christina saw that they were on the 13th floor and immediately pressed the button for the 14th floor, "I'm telling the truth. Do I have to die for telling the truth?"

"William, you need to understand, I'm the victim, not the perpetrator. If you think our sexual relationship has a bad impact on you, then go find the person who drugged you."

"Don't take all your anger out on me."

Christina knew very well that William was venting all his anger on her, blaming her for appearing, and not daring to do anything to Jennifer, unwilling to let his beloved suffer any grievance.

William sneered, "You're so eloquent, why don't you deal with those reporters yourself?"

"With you here, of course, I have to make good use of your reputation. Besides, how can my words carry as much weight as yours?"

Christina met William's gaze and smiled.

The next second, with a "ding," the elevator door opened.

Christina immediately tried to run out, but William was always a step faster.

William grabbed her.

With a strong force, he threw her against the back wall. At that moment, all she felt was pain.

"William, are you crazy?"

The elevator door quickly closed.

However, people on the 13th floor passing by the elevator clearly heard a woman shouting William's name, and her tone was not good.

William now stood in front of Christina, his tall figure completely overshadowing her.

William's large hand gripped Christina's neck, "Didn't you call me uncle?"

Christina had called him by his name several times already, and just now, she had shouted it loudly.

Christina mocked, "I'm not your real niece. But haven't we already discussed this? William, if I were really your niece, even if you were drugged and irrational, you wouldn't have had sex with me. Why don't you ask yourself why you couldn't control yourself?"

William liked to push all the problems onto her, didn't he?

Then she would learn from William and push all the problems onto him, making it seem like she couldn't shirk responsibility.

"Then tell me, why were you there?" William sneered, gripping Christina's waist.

Christina's whole body tensed up.

William was definitely doing this on purpose, testing her.

He even moved closer.

His hot breath brushed against her face, and Christina's breathing became heavy.

She reached out to push William away, but she couldn't.

Instead, William grabbed her hands, pinning her against the elevator wall.

At such close proximity, Christina felt extremely pressured.

She could hardly breathe.

"Weren't you just trying to disgust me? Christina, I think your body is more honest than your mouth," William said slowly, his voice hoarse.

He reached out, his long fingers trailing from Christina's neck to her collarbone.

"Are you crazy?"

Christina grabbed William's hand.

She was completely disappointed in William and would never allow him to behave like this towards her.

After all, having lived two lives, her body was so familiar with William that some instinctive reactions were beyond her control.

William's mocking smile deepened, "Rather than saying I'm crazy, it's more like you can't control yourself. Christina, your feelings..."

"Who hasn't had feelings for someone? After this incident, I'm completely disappointed in you. I've seen clearly your feelings for Jennifer. I've already taken this loss, can you stop testing me?"

Before William could speak, Christina interrupted him urgently.

Rather than waiting for William to press her step by step, she might as well admit it first.

What does youthful affection mean?

And her meaning was clear, feelings can change.

William's face darkened, "Rather than saying you've seen clearly, it's more like you realized reality didn't go as you expected, so you backed off."

"If it wasn't for your instigation, would your good friend have done this?"

In William's mind, he firmly believed that she was the mastermind behind this.

Christina was speechless.

Missy had caused all this trouble at this critical moment, making it impossible for her to explain to William.

Annoying!

"William, since you believe I conspired with Missy, can I assume this is a trap set by you and Jennifer? This way, you can be with Jennifer without any scruples? After all, Grandpa never approved of your Jennifer!"

Trying to convict her?

###chapter 26: Isn't That Also Your Fault?

Christina is innocent, and she does not admit to any guilt.

"You know so much?" William laughed out loud.

His eyes seemed to want to see right through her.

Christina chuckled softly, "Is there any secret between you and Jennifer?"

His relationship with Jennifer was a well-known secret.

If he and Jennifer had no involvement, how could Jennifer possibly stand with the Cavendish family?

If Jennifer didn't want to be with William, how could she have drugged him to promote their relationship?

How could William possibly appear at the architecture institute with Jennifer?

"Now you're taking me to your office. If any problems arise, don't push all the responsibility onto me," Christina said coldly.

The elevator had already risen to the 26th floor.

When she entered the elevator, she had pressed the basement level, intending to leave from the underground parking lot.

Now that William was blocking her, it was clear he wouldn't let her go, so she had to speak up.

William chuckled, "You really think ahead."

But then again, Christina was so thoughtful. When the incident happened, wasn't she thinking of getting closer to him? Otherwise, knowing the consequences, how could she have appeared?

"Christina, you really have a good plan."

William now wanted to strangle Christina, but he couldn't lay a hand on her.

Christina laughed sarcastically, "What plan? What did I take from you?"

She didn't take his money, nor did she take his shares.

She took nothing, so what was William thinking?

William grabbed her by the neck, using some force but not enough to suffocate her. "What do you think? At the press conference just now, what did you take?"

The press conference, the clarification meeting, was something she had threatened him to attend.

And it was live. Christina took everything she wanted from it, cleared her name, and could return to school.

"Yes, in your eyes, I got what I wanted. But for you, didn't your reputation also get cleared?" Christina laughed more sarcastically. "If you didn't clarify, your Jennifer would probably be threatening suicide again. If she died, how much would your heart ache?"

Jennifer was William's only treasure, his weakness.

"Wasn't it you who forced her?"

William's face darkened.

These words made Christina laugh out loud, "I forced her? Did I put a knife to her neck and force her to drug you?"

"You think I'm not smart enough, but is your Jennifer an idiot? Would she do something that doesn't benefit her?"

Christina restrained her smile and spoke to William word by word.

William didn't speak, his face seemed to be covered with a thick layer of frost.

Jennifer had already admitted her mistake, and everything had come to a conclusion.

"Get out!"

William roared in anger.

When the elevator reached the 32nd floor, Christina walked out without hesitation.

She left William in the elevator without looking back.

William thought she was scheming and didn't want to see her, and she didn't want to see William either. In this life, she only wanted to stay as far away from William as possible.

Christina knew that there might still be reporters at the entrance.

The best way for her to leave the Cavendish Corporation was to leave from the parking lot.

She took another elevator straight to the basement level.

Meanwhile, on William's side.

Bob called to report, "Mr. Cavendish, I have handled the reporters properly. They did not take any money."

William said coldly, "Follow up and don't let public opinion escalate."

"Yes."

Bob responded quickly.

And Christina, she moved quickly too. After reaching the parking lot, she walked out.

She was thinking of using a ride-hailing app, but unexpectedly, she received a call from her mother. She answered it.

Elisa had seen the online public opinion and noticed that Christina was about to be expelled, "What's going on? Why didn't you call me when such a big thing happened?"

Christina said calmly, "It's already resolved."

What good would it do to call Elisa?

Her mother didn't have it easy in the Cavendish family either, and besides, this matter mainly involved her and William.

She had bet correctly; William clarified, and that resolved it.

Elisa listened to Christina's words and felt that Christina's tone, and her calmness from the incident until now, were surprising.

If it were any other 21-year-old girl, she would have been scared and panicked. But Christina managed to sort out her logic and win a round for herself.

Elisa didn't know whether to cry or laugh. Her heart felt heavy, as if a giant stone was pressing on her, making it hard to breathe.

"Mom, if there's nothing else, I'll hang up now. I still have things to do."

She would let the school wait and come to her. Now, she needed to find something to do.

After all, she had to leave William's place at any time.

If she didn't find a place to stay or a job, where would she go?

Elisa stopped her, "Why are you hanging up? I haven't finished talking. Even though you said it's only half a month with William, I really want you to consider it seriously. Instead of going on blind dates with others, why not try to marry William?"

Although Christina had said harsh words, people had to bow to reality.

Christina was frustrated. She didn't expect that even at this point, Elisa still wanted her to be with William.

What did William have besides money?

In her previous life, she always thought that with her sincere heart, she could move William's cold and indifferent heart.

But what was the result?

In the end, she and her daughter both died tragically, and her precious Harper didn't even grow up, dying without a complete body.

If she got involved with William again, her tragic death in her previous life would be deserved!

"I have no interest in William. Mom, if it's about money, I can earn it with my own hands. You should focus on living your own life well. You don't need to worry about me."

With that, Christina hung up. She didn't want to talk about her and William anymore.

Elisa listened to the busy tone, her heart heavy.

Her good intentions and the great opportunity in front of her, why did they become a suffocating shackle for Christina?

###chapter 27: What Does This Have to Do with Me?

Elisa didn't want to give up just like that.

Just as she was about to make a call, she heard a "cough."

Elisa's face turned pale with fright, and she almost dropped her phone.

Seeing Raymond standing not far away, Elisa's heart pounded with panic, "Raymond, why are you back? Weren't you supposed to meet your friend today?"

She didn't even know when Raymond had appeared.

She didn't know if Raymond had heard the conversation she just had with Christina.

If he had heard, how would she face him?

She didn't dare to face Raymond now.

"I came back early. I saw you were on the phone, so I didn't come forward."

However, Elisa's eyes and expression were filled with calculation and determination.

He spoke up, not wanting Elisa to take this step.

Elisa was completely flustered, "Raymond, listen to me, I was just angry. Clearly, Christina didn't do this, but now Christina is in this situation."

Elisa stepped forward, clutching her phone.

In Raymond's eyes, she had always been the image of a good wife.

But Raymond had already heard the call between her and Christina.

In his eyes, she was scheming against William, trying to push Christina onto William.

"I know. But you have to understand, William hates being manipulated the most. Now, he just doesn't believe that Christina had nothing to do with it. But by doing this, you're just pushing Christina into the spotlight."

Raymond pursed his lips and continued, "Do you think I don't know that you deliberately bribed the servant to lead Dad to William's villa at the dinner table?"

Elisa was immediately ashamed.

"Don't make another mistake, or you'll harm others and yourself."

"I won't think like that anymore, I'm sorry." Elisa lowered her head, now like a child who had done something wrong.

Seeing her like this, Raymond couldn't bear it either.

He hugged Elisa, "Alright, don't think too much. I'll find a good match for Christina, she won't be left alone."

"Thank you, Raymond."

They had lived together for many years and understood each other's temperaments well.

Neither of them was a bad person, so Raymond didn't blame Elisa, and Elisa knew that once Raymond promised, he would keep his word.

This way, her daughter's future would be secure, and she could be at ease.

Now, with the online public opinion like this, even if Christina and William explained, Christina's bad reputation hadn't been cleared.

Online, she was seen as someone with a messy private life, who liked her uncle, and had a twisted love.

No company wanted to hire her.

She couldn't possibly work as a cleaner.

There were many who openly rejected her, and some even mocked her to her face, "You can get your uncle to clear your name in front of the media, why don't you just ask him to arrange a position for you at the Cavendish Corporation?"

"Looking for a job? Do you even need to look for a job?"

Christina didn't expect that even after clarifying, her reputation was still so bad.

So, regarding the school, she feared waiting for the school to come to her was impossible. It seemed she had to go to the school herself.

But before going to the school, she called William.

"Uncle, our clarification didn't work. I need to go to the school now, can you find some people to help me? I need to get back to school."

William had just picked up the phone when he heard Christina's demand.

"Are you asking me for a favor or demanding it?" William's face was cold; holding the press conference was already a favor.

But to Christina, she didn't know how to restrain herself.

Christina pursed her lips and said softly, "Helping me is mutually beneficial. Otherwise, it would be terrible."

She couldn't bring herself to beg William in that tone anymore.

But William knew the current situation.

William smirked coldly, "What does this have to do with me?"

Before Christina could say anything, she heard Bob's respectful voice, "Mr. Cavendish, the project approval for the area around Harvard has come through."

William's business was widespread.

William's connections were the same; with just a little effort, he could help her get back to school. And she didn't believe that after the press conference, William hadn't asked Bob to follow up on this matter.

So!

William knew she was in this predicament and didn't want to help.

She didn't expect William to help, but now, only William could solve this quickly, and she couldn't delay any longer.

She had to get back to school immediately and compete.

"William, this has nothing to do with you. But you don't want to be entangled with me forever, right? I was the victim that night. If I go to the police and talk nonsense..."

Christina deliberately didn't finish her sentence. If she went to the police and talked nonsense, it would definitely affect William.

She was betting that William didn't want to be affected.

William said coldly, "You go to the school and handle this yourself. I'll have Bob notify the school."

"Okay."

Hearing this, Christina finally breathed a sigh of relief.

So, Christina set off for the school.

She was now a celebrity online, and as soon as she entered the school, eyes immediately followed her.

Some even said directly to her face, "Isn't this Christina who seduced her uncle? The school is going to expel you, how do you still have the face to come to school?"

"Why wouldn't she dare to come? Isn't it the internet age? Being scolded and getting attention is still attention, can't she become famous this way?"

"Really a benefit of the times, does Christina have some expert advising her?"

Christina didn't want to deal with this now. She knew one thing clearly, she had to go to the dean's office.

Anyway, after returning to school, she would have plenty of opportunities to deal with these people.

Ignoring them, Christina went to the dean's office. The people there changed their expressions when they saw her.

They wanted to expel Christina, but she had posted online and found people to help, they couldn't stand her behavior but were helpless against her.

"Although you can stay now, you must strictly follow the school's rules. If this happens again, no matter who you find, it won't help."

Christina nodded and wrote a guarantee, of course, this was to appease them. What she wanted most was to participate in the school's art competition.

At this point, they didn't want Christina to return, but she did. If they stopped her, it would cause more trouble.

So, Christina re-registered.

###chapter 28 Encountering Danger on the Road

After registering, Christina left the school.

She didn't want to go back to William's villa right now, and of course, she wouldn't go back to the Cavendish Mansion at this critical moment either.

However, William definitely wouldn't allow her not to return to the villa.

She could only forcibly stall for time.

She didn't expect a van to suddenly stop in front of her, the rear door opened, and inside were several men wearing masks and sunglasses.

There was a parking lot not far behind her, but the car didn't stop there; instead, it stopped right next to her, which was already a bit strange.

Moreover, the men in the car were covered up so tightly that not even their eyes were visible, and Christina's intuition kept warning her.

Seeing that these men seemed to be getting out of the car, Christina turned around and ran, regardless of whether these people were bad guys or not, it was better to run first.

She would rather misunderstand them than stand there foolishly and wait until she was really in danger, by then it would be too late.

"She's running, chase her."

A man's voice vaguely came from behind.

Christina ran even faster. She wanted to call the police, but her phone was in her backpack, and it was a bit difficult to take it out.

She didn't dare to stop for a moment, fearing that this group of people would catch up to her.

But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't outrun these men. The footsteps behind her were getting louder, and the distance between them was getting closer.

There was no one on the road at this time, so even if Christina wanted to ask for help, she couldn't.

Suddenly, she saw a car parked ahead with its hazard lights on.

The license plate was unfamiliar; she had never seen it before.

But she couldn't care about that now.

Christina ran over as fast as she could, directly opened the back door, got in, and closed the door behind her.

From this angle, she could clearly see that the men had already caught up to the car. If she had been a step slower, they would have caught her!

They looked at the car with resentment but were also wary and didn't dare to come over directly.

Christina finally breathed a sigh of relief.

She was about to turn and apologize to the person in the car, to explain her actions, when she heard a familiar voice next to her ear.

"Get out of the car!"

It was William's voice.

So, she had randomly gotten into a car, and it turned out to be William's?

Christina wished this was her imagination; she really didn't want to deal with William right now.

Otherwise, she wouldn't have been wandering outside the school alone after class, trying to stall for time.

"Christina, are my words useless now? I told you to get out, didn't you hear me?" William urged impatiently.

His gaze fell on Christina, very cold, without a trace of emotion.

What time was it?

Christina should have been home long ago, but she was still outside and had offended a group of people who were chasing her.

Now she wanted to bring her mess to him.

How could William tolerate this?

Christina couldn't get out of the car now.

Those men were obviously watching her closely, possibly hiding in some corner waiting for her. If she got out, wouldn't she be caught by them?

She tried to reason with William, "Could you please give me a ride to a busy intersection and drop me off? It's a special situation today, otherwise, I wouldn't trouble you."

"Am I your personal driver?" William didn't buy it at all.

After a back-and-forth, Christina was also filled with anger.

If it weren't for avoiding William, she wouldn't have been outside alone and wouldn't have encountered those men.

What was his attitude now?

"Bob, drive." Christina didn't want to waste more words with him.

She directly called the assistant's name.

Bob was in a dilemma; one told him to stop, the other told him to drive. It was really difficult for him, a small person, to decide whom to listen to.

While he was hesitating, a horn sounded from behind.

Another car was coming and urging them to move.

Bob quickly stepped on the gas.

William inadvertently looked up and saw those men hiding around the corner; they didn't look like good people.

Although he didn't like Christina, he couldn't just watch her die.

He tacitly allowed Christina to stay in the car and didn't mention making her get out again, "You are a student, and a student's main task is to study. Don't hang out with those shady people every day. Even if you don't care about your reputation, at least care about your safety."

Today she was lucky to run into him. If she hadn't, could Christina have escaped from those men on her own?

What would have happened to her was obvious.

Christina was furious at his words, "Can you stop slandering me? Is it my fault that I was targeted by bad guys? What you're saying now is victim-blaming!"

She had never seen those men and had no connection with them.

"Christina," William's face grew colder, and his tone more threatening, "Is this how you talk to your savior?"

Christina simply turned her head to the side.

She didn't look at William and didn't want to talk to him.

The atmosphere in the car became awkward and heavy, and Bob didn't dare to make a sound, just silently driving.

Soon the car passed by a large shopping mall.

Those men had been left behind, and even if they followed, there were many people here, so they probably wouldn't dare to make a move.

"Bob, stop the car, I want to get out." Christina put her hand on the door handle.

Bob didn't step on the brake; he was waiting for William's instructions.

Seeing this, Christina didn't say anything more, just pressed the door handle with a bit of force.

This scared Bob, and he instinctively stepped on the brake, stopping the car steadily by the roadside.

Then Christina pushed the door open and got out without saying a word.

Watching her back, William pressed his lips tightly, his eyes filled with anger, "She really has gotten bolder."

She got in and out of his car as she pleased, without even saying a word before leaving. Even a driver wouldn't be treated like this!

He had just been worried about Christina's safety and allowed her to stay in the car.

And now!

He really felt like killing her.

"Mr. Cavendish," Bob finally spoke, "Ms. Windsor getting out now is actually good. Otherwise, if we go to the company and reporters see her getting out of your car, they might start spreading rumors again."

These entertainment reporters would eagerly post anything they saw online to make a profit.

###chapter 29: Threatening to Cut Wrists

William remained silent, the sarcasm in his eyes growing more intense.

He thought about avoiding suspicion, but would that really work?

Christina kept causing trouble, and when she couldn't handle it, she would come to him for help. Today, the media didn't catch it, but who knows about the future?

"Mr. Cavendish, are we heading back to the company now, or should I get out and bring Ms. Windsor back?" Bob didn't wait for William's answer and couldn't guess his thoughts, so he had to forcefully continue asking.

William frowned, "Why bring her back? Just drive."

He didn't want to have any entanglements with Christina; out of sight, out of mind.

Meanwhile, with Jennifer.

Since the afternoon, she had been anxiously waiting in her bedroom, waiting until now.

Several times she couldn't wait any longer and wanted to call, but she was afraid the call would disturb the other party, so she had to be patient.

Finally, her phone rang.

She hurriedly answered the call, "How did it go?"

"The plan failed."

"What? I calculated everything so well, how could it fail!" Jennifer's face turned extremely ugly.

She had been waiting for so long, hoping for good news, not bad news!

She had hired so many people, and they couldn't even deal with one woman, Christina.

"Did you take my money and not want to do the job, deliberately fooling me?" Jennifer directly questioned, "We are in this together, and the final payment hasn't been settled. If you want to get the money, then follow my instructions."

"Don't give me excuses, I just want Christina dead. If you failed today, then think of another way. I only care about the result."

After hanging up the phone, Jennifer's eyes were full of malice.

She hadn't expected that day to lead to Christina and William having a sexual relationship. Only a dead person would make her feel at ease.

So Christina must die!

After all the fuss, Christina was hungry and decided to go into a mall and find a restaurant to sit down and eat something.

While waiting for the food, Elisa called, "Christina, where are you now?"

"I'm eating. Do you need something?" Christina's tone was indifferent.

Knowing Elisa, if there was nothing important, she wouldn't have made this call.

And she was right.

Elisa directly informed her, "You're not young anymore; it's time to get married. I've arranged a blind date for you tomorrow at noon. You must be there on time."

Christina laughed self-deprecatingly.

This was her biological mother, arranging a blind date for her and expecting her to comply.

But did Elisa ever consider whether she was willing to go on a blind date?

Why didn't anyone respect her personal wishes!

"I'm not interested in blind dates, so you don't need to bother arranging them. I won't go tomorrow." Christina stated directly.

This immediately angered Elisa.

She scolded, "If you don't go on a blind date now, when will you? Do you want to wait until you're over thirty to find a partner? By then, all the good men will be taken. I'm your mother; I won't harm you. You must listen to me."

"Even if all the good men are taken, it's my choice, and I'll bear the consequences. You don't need to worry." No matter what Elisa said, Christina refused to compromise.

Being forced into a blind date was just the beginning.

If she compromised, then after the blind date, it would be pressure to marry, then to have children, and even a second or third child.

This was not the life Christina wanted.

"Are you trying to drive me to my death? Will you only listen if I'm dead?" Elisa hung up the phone in anger.

Christina put her phone aside, ignoring it.

She didn't believe Elisa would really seek death just because she refused a blind date.

The food was quickly served, and she had just picked up a piece of egg with her fork when she heard the familiar ringtone again.

It was Elisa's call.

Christina really didn't want to answer, but after all, it was her biological mother. She thought for a moment and finally pressed the answer button.

"Mom is asking you one last time, will you go to the blind date tomorrow?" Elisa started with this matter.

"No."

Christina's answer was simple and straightforward, "No matter how many times you ask, I won't go. I advise you not to waste your efforts."

"Fine, then I'll die today to show you!" Elisa threatened.

She was already at the hospital. In front of everyone, she took out a prepared fruit knife from her bag and slashed her wrist.

Blood gushed out immediately.

Everyone around was terrified, and medical staff rushed over, grabbing the knife from her hand.

"Someone's slashed their wrist, notify the emergency doctor."

"Take her to the emergency room, quickly. She's losing a lot of blood, stop the bleeding."

Elisa remained motionless, looking at the phone on the ground, raising her voice, "Christina, if you don't go to the blind date, you won't have a mother!"

"Ma'am, life is precious. Even if you're angry with your child, you can't risk your life. Let's bandage the wound first." The doctor kept persuading Elisa.

A nurse picked up the phone.

She glanced at the screen, still in the call, and couldn't help but help Elisa persuade Christina, "Your mother has slashed her wrist. Her emotions are very unstable. You should come over and say something to calm her down, don't let her do anything drastic."

"It's just a blind date. You can go and find an excuse to decline later. A blind date doesn't mean it will work out. There's no need to go against your parents; the cost is too high."

Christina was in a daze.

If she hadn't heard it herself, she wouldn't have believed her mother would slash her wrist over her refusal to go on a blind date.

If this got out, wouldn't people laugh at her?

Elisa was forcing her into an awkward and painful situation.

"We're at Evergreen Hospital. Your mother is in the emergency room. If you want to come, hurry. I'll go check on the patient." The nurse added before hanging up and rushing to the emergency room.

On the other end, Christina looked at the food on the table, feeling no appetite.

With Elisa causing such a scene, she had no choice but to go.

After paying the bill, Christina left the mall, hailed a cab, and rushed to Evergreen Hospital as quickly as possible.

###chapter 30: Blind Date in the Hospital Ward

When Christina rushed into the emergency room, Elisa had already had her wound treated and was being wheeled into a ward.

Christina pushed the door open and entered, "Mom, is this really necessary? Just because I won't go on a blind date, you threaten to commit suicide. Aren't you afraid of being laughed at?"

"You still know to come over. I thought you didn't care about me at all," Elisa glanced at her.

Christina was speechless.

She just didn't want to get married now; it wasn't like she had committed some unforgivable crime.

But she knew she couldn't explain this to Elisa.

"You are my biological mother, of course, I care about you. I couldn't just let you die. But marriage is a very important thing in my life, it concerns my future happiness. I can't listen to you on everything. I will come to see you, but I won't go to the blind date tomorrow."

Christina decided to make things clear.

If Elisa insisted on making a fuss, there was nothing she could do.

However, as mother and daughter, she understood her mother to some extent. Elisa didn't have the courage to really kill herself.

"Christina! Do you really want to drive me to my death? Do you believe I'll jump out of the window right now?" Elisa pointed to the window in the ward.

She even lifted the quilt, pretending to get out of bed.

Christina was at her wit's end, "Mom, if I go on the blind date, will you take care of your health and stop making a fuss?"

Before she could finish her sentence, there was a knock on the door.

Christina initially thought it was Raymond.

But when she opened the door, she saw a stranger, a man she had never seen before.

"Is Zachary Bennett here?" Elisa walked over and her face lit up when she saw Zachary, "You shouldn't have brought gifts. Just come in. Christina, go make two cups of coffee."

Elisa's enthusiastic attitude and Zachary's polite greetings made Christina realize what was happening.

This man was likely her blind date.

Since she refused to go tomorrow, Elisa had called him over today to meet her in the ward.

Christina felt a deep sense of disappointment.

She had rushed over out of concern for her mother, but this concern had become a tool for her mother to control her.

"Christina, don't just stand there. There are fruits in my bag, go wash them and put them on a plate," Elisa urged when she saw Christina not moving.

Christina said nothing and turned to do as she was told.

Of course, she wouldn't take this blind date seriously. As the nurse had told her on the phone, there were many ways to make a blind date fail.

Since Elisa didn't consider her feelings, she would do the same.

After washing the fruits, Christina went to make coffee.

She was already good-looking and had a nice figure. Now, busying herself around, she looked like an ideal wife and mother in Zachary's eyes.

He gave a thumbs up, "Elisa, your daughter is really beautiful."

"Today, you two get to know each other, add each other as friends, and go out for a meal tomorrow. If you both feel good about each other, let's settle things quickly," Elisa arranged everything.

She had carefully chosen Zachary, the only son of the Bennett Family. Although he was short and a bit fat, the Bennett Family was wealthy, and he was their only pampered son. Everything in his family would be his in the future.

Christina could enjoy a good life with him.

"Sure, my dad also wants to have a grandchild soon," Zachary agreed happily.

Mainly because Christina was really beautiful, like those big stars online, fitting his aesthetic perfectly.

He fell in love at first sight.

"This is the only coffee we have, make do with it," Christina quickly brought the coffee over.

Zachary's eyes were fixed on her, looking her up and down, becoming more satisfied the more he looked.

As for the coffee, he wasn't picky, "As long as there's something to drink, even water is fine. Come, sit down, let's have a good chat."

"Alright," Christina sat directly opposite him.

She first gave a brief self-introduction.

Just as Elisa was smiling broadly, Christina changed her tone, "You can see that I'm quite pretty, so I've had a lot of relationships."

Zachary's face turned a bit sour, but he said nothing, "Those things are in the past. As long as after we get married..."

"I had sex with someone when I was fourteen. Over the years, I've had many boyfriends, at least a dozen," Christina continued, lying without blinking.

She didn't believe Zachary could accept such a woman.

"Christina!" Elisa was almost furious.

Her chest heaved with anger, her face full of rage, "What nonsense are you spouting?"

She had just thought her daughter had come to her senses and was willing to cooperate with the blind date, but it turned out she was waiting to sabotage it.

How could Christina, so young, say such things?

She had no sense of shame!

"Mom, I think honesty is important in a blind date. Lying isn't good," Christina looked troubled.

She glanced at Zachary, then at her mother, as if making a big decision, "I'm sorry, I was just joking."

"You two are teaming up to fool me?" Zachary slammed the table and stood up angrily.

He had been polite to Elisa, but now he was furious, "You praised your daughter so much, but she's just a promiscuous woman. Luckily, I didn't get involved with her, or I would have been played for a fool by you two!"

"Fuck, a blind date? You think you're worthy? I'd rather throw these gifts away than give them to you."

Zachary cursed for a while, then grabbed the gifts from the floor and stormed out.

Only Christina and Elisa were left in the ward.

Elisa was trembling with anger, unable to control her emotions, she slapped Christina hard and scolded, "How can you be so disappointing? I worked so hard to find you a good match, wanting you to marry well, but you ruined everything with a few words. You might as well kill me!"

If Zachary spread today's events, which man would dare to want Christina in the future?

What had she done in her past life to deserve such a daughter in this one?

"You're really here to anger me. I should have strangled you when you were born, then I wouldn't be dying of anger now!" Elisa wiped her tears and kept scolding.

###chapter 31: You Should Encourage Me

Christina listened quietly, waiting for Elisa to vent for a while. Seeing her face now flushed and her voice full of energy, she didn't look like a patient at all.

"Since you're fine now, I'll head back. You should rest well," Christina said, turning to leave.

Elisa was thoroughly infuriated and grabbed a cup from the table, throwing it at her.

But Christina closed the door faster, and the cup hit the door instead of her back, shattering with a crisp sound.

Hearing the commotion behind her, Christina's eyes reddened slightly.

What kind of mother is this?

The moment she met Zachary, she felt this man was unreliable. The way he looked at her was like he was evaluating merchandise, not a person.

But Elisa couldn't understand all this.

Elisa thought Zachary was a good man, and Christina should be overjoyed to marry him. But how could she do that?

Soon, Raymond returned, also concerned about the matchmaking result.

"I'm really going to be angered to death by this unfilial daughter. How could she treat me like this?" Elisa complained, wiping her tears.

Raymond quickly noticed the marks on her wrist, helped her sit down, and comforted her, "She's grown up and has her own thoughts. Since things have already turned out this way today, don't think about it anymore. Rest well and heal your wrist first."

Elisa nodded.

There was nothing else to do now. Other matters would have to wait until she recovered.

After leaving the hospital, Christina returned to William's villa.

She didn't know if he was too busy tonight or just didn't want to see her, but William didn't show up at the villa the entire evening.

Christina enjoyed the solitude.

She first took a bath, then changed into pajamas and comfortably lay on the bed. The preliminary round of the Golden Cup Award was the day after tomorrow. Jennifer would not only participate but also definitely aim for the championship.

Coincidentally, she was also determined to win the championship.

In her previous life, all her achievements were stolen by Jennifer. Everyone thought Jennifer was the genius designer, but in reality?

Christina, who had real talent and knowledge, ended up the worst off.

Now that she had a second chance, she would slowly take back everything she lost and reveal Jennifer's true colors. Only then would she be true to her past self.

With these thoughts, Christina quickly fell asleep.

She slept until after nine, and upon waking, she saw several missed calls on her phone, mostly from Elisa.

Elisa calling was surely to scold her for being disobedient, and she couldn't be bothered to respond.

The remaining two calls were from Missy.

Thinking of Missy, Christina chuckled. This was her 'best friend' from two lifetimes.

In her past life, she trusted Missy completely, considering her a lifelong friend. She took Missy's words to heart.

But Missy was actually Jennifer's good friend. The two of them teamed up to make her life miserable. Now that Missy was reaching out again, Christina was ready to exact her revenge!

Christina called Missy back.

The phone barely rang before Missy answered, immediately complaining, "I've been messaging and calling you, why didn't you respond? If I didn't care about you, I wouldn't be reaching out so early. And this is how you treat me!"

In the past, Christina would have felt guilty and apologized to make it up to her.

But now, Christina didn't think she was wrong at all.

She confidently retorted, "Can't I sleep in? I was sleeping and didn't hear your calls. You're really mad over something so trivial? Do you really consider me a friend?"

"That's not what I meant, I..."

"I don't think so either. We've known each other for so long, you're a good person, not one to hold grudges." Christina praised her, completely blocking her words.

Missy had no choice but to change the topic, "I called today to advise you to give up on the Golden Cup Award. You've seen the online comments; no one thinks you'll win. If you lose, you'll be ridiculed. Let's keep a low profile."

Look at how she phrased it. Missy seemed to be looking out for her, but her true intentions were clear.

Christina's fan base was indeed smaller than Jennifer's.

But people followed Jennifer because they believed she had real talent. They admired her skills.

Once the truth came out and people saw Jennifer's true nature, they would naturally stop supporting her.

"I won't lose. The more people doubt me, the more I want to prove myself. I can't just give up because of a few words from others." Christina told Missy, "I will compete, and I'm confident I can win."

Missy panicked upon hearing this.

She called to persuade Christina to give up, not to fuel her competitive spirit.

"But I really think the online comments are harsh. Why put yourself through this? Christina, northern travel is popular now. Why don't we join a tour group and take a trip? I'll go with you to relax."

Christina coldly laughed to herself.

How did she not see through this obvious ploy in her past life?

The more Missy wanted her to give up, the less she would listen. Annoyed, she directly got angry, "Are you not treating me as a friend?"

"Of course not, you're my best friend. We're besties. It's because we're close that I want to look out for you." Missy was also puzzled.

What happened to Christina?

She used to be so gullible, believing anything with a few words. Now she seemed like a different person, smarter.

"Since you know we're besties, you should support me. I want to win, and you should encourage me, not discourage me. If I tell others about your behavior now, they might say you're a toxic friend." Christina didn't hold back.

Missy forced a smile, feeling extremely awkward, "Of course not."

"You definitely want me to win. Besties want each other to do well. Alright, I won't talk anymore. I need to prepare for the competition. When I win, we'll celebrate together." Christina toyed with her before hanging up.

Missy was left holding the phone, stunned.

###chapter 32: I Am Determined to Win First Place

Missy's goal was not achieved, and she was really unwilling. After hesitating for a long time, she wanted to make another call.

But who knew, Christina directly put her phone on airplane mode.

Now Missy was really angry and helpless.

On the eve of the competition, Jennifer specifically sent someone to inquire and found out that Christina was going to participate. Her face turned extremely ugly.

If she lost to Christina, wouldn't she lose all her dignity?

No, she had to come up with a plan.

She spent a lot of money to find the competition staff and made preparations in advance. Only then did she confidently walk into the competition venue.

Coincidentally, her position was in line with Christina's. As long as she turned her head, she could see Christina.

Soon all the contestants took their seats. Jennifer gave Christina a provocative look.

Christina wanting to compete with her was nothing but wishful thinking!

"The competition officially starts now. You have a total of two hours. When the time is up, you must put down your brushes. The judges will score on the spot and announce the results directly." The referee blew the whistle.

Christina had already decided what to draw. She picked up her brush and opened the paint box, quickly realizing something was wrong.

She raised her hand to signal, "Some of my paint colors are dried out."

"Sorry, that's our staff's mistake. Please wait a moment, I'll get you a replacement." The staff member hurried over, agreeing readily.

But in reality, most of the competition passed without the staff member returning with the paint.

During this time, Christina raised her hand to ask again, only to be told that the paint was out of stock and the staff had to buy more.

With only two hours in total, by the time the staff returned, the competition would be over.

She couldn't make a scene over this.

Suddenly, Christina noticed the gold powder next to her. She quietly picked it up. Without paint, she would mix a color on the spot.

Time passed minute by minute, and soon the competition was nearing its end.

Christina was the first to put down her brush.

Jennifer had been closely watching her actions. Seeing her put down her brush, Jennifer almost laughed out loud.

Without paint, what could Christina possibly draw?

Putting down her brush so quickly meant she had given up.

Jennifer continued painting until the whistle blew. Only then did she confidently put down her brush and sat waiting for the judges to score.

The judges scored anonymously, covering the contestants' names and shuffling the order.

Jennifer's painting was first. The three judges took turns looking at it and gave high scores.

Her smile grew wider.

With such high scores, she was sure to be in the top three. It seemed she had a good chance of winning first place.

Soon all the paintings were scored. Jennifer indeed made it into the top three, only one point behind the second place, very close.

Next, the contestants' names were announced.

"First place is Travis Hayes, second place is Jennifer, third place is Christina." The referee announced the names while displaying the paintings.

Hearing the last name, Jennifer was struck as if by lightning.

How could it be?

Christina didn't even have paint. How could she draw so well?

She couldn't believe her eyes!

"There was a small mistake during the competition. The third-place contestant was missing some paint colors, which she mixed herself. Without this issue, her score would likely be even higher," the middle judge remarked.

Christina was the unexpected surprise of this preliminary round.

Several reporters crowded around Christina, eagerly interviewing her, while others interviewed the first-place winner.

As for Jennifer, she was now in an awkward position, becoming the ignored one.

She was so angry she trembled, not knowing how she got home. Once she closed the door, she threw a fit.

"Why? Why Christina?"

The competition had only two rounds, the preliminary and the final. The average score of both rounds determined the winner.

If she lost to someone else, it would be fine. But losing to Christina was unbearable.

With only a few days between the preliminary and the final, even if she hired the best painting master and practiced tirelessly, she couldn't achieve such great progress in a few days.

To win first place, she had to use some tricks.

"Christina, you forced me to do this." Jennifer bit her lip.

She could bribe the staff in the preliminary, so she could do the same in the final.

She not only wanted to win first place but also frame Christina, exposing her true colors to everyone and making her despised online.

Only then could she vent her anger!

Christina also guessed that Jennifer wouldn't let it go.

But it didn't matter. She would deal with it as it came. Christina wasn't easy to bully either.

The night before the final, Missy called to invite her out for dinner, "Christina, you have the competition tomorrow. Tonight, I'll throw you a celebration dinner in advance."

"No need. I need to rest early tonight. We'll celebrate after I win first place." Christina hung up after saying this.

She knew Missy had bad intentions, so she wouldn't go.

First, she would deal with Jennifer. After the competition, she would settle the score with Missy!

Early the next morning, Christina arrived at the competition venue. She had become a popular figure, gaining many fans from the preliminary. Some fans even asked for photos.

Christina obliged as much as she could. When the competition was about to start, she went to her seat and carefully checked everything to ensure no one had tampered with anything.

The brushes were fine, the easel and paint were fine, but the more normal everything seemed, the more suspicious it was.

Jennifer wouldn't let her off easily.

"I will definitely win first place today." Jennifer's determined voice came from beside her.

Christina glanced at her and smiled, "First place goes to the capable, not the loudest."

Jennifer turned away angrily.

Just wait. After today, Christina wouldn't be able to laugh!

Christina suddenly thought of something. She quietly picked up her brush and started painting as usual.

When the competition ended, all the contestants put down their brushes, including her.

###chapter 33: How Can It Be Exactly the Same

It was already the final competition, and today the true winner would be selected from the works. Multiple TV stations had bought the broadcasting rights, and a panel of industry bigwigs served as judges. Multiple cameras were focused on the center stage, making it a highly anticipated event.

The host, dressed in formal attire, stood under the spotlight.

"Dear guests, after several rounds of selection, ten contestants have made it to the final competition. Today, the ultimate winner will be chosen from these ten. Let's wait and see!"

After a round of cheers, the stage lights came on, and a platform slowly rose from below, displaying ten paintings covered with cloth, leaving the final suspense.

The judges whispered among themselves.

The contestants stood in front of their respective works.

Jennifer saw Christina standing next to her and slightly raised her chin, looking determined to win.

As the music started, the mechanism in the air pulled up the cloth, revealing the ten paintings to the audience.

Those who made it to the finals were naturally the best, and the ten paintings were so evenly matched that it was dazzling to look at them all at once.

But at that moment, a sudden exclamation erupted from the audience.

"Why are those two paintings exactly the same?"

The host glanced over and froze, but she quickly realized that this was not just a stage accident but a huge publicity opportunity that could make their show even more famous.

She pointed out two people: "The authors of the two identical paintings are Jennifer and Christina."

Jennifer turned around and saw the work in front of her, her face changing as she angrily questioned, "You plagiarized me."

Christina remained calm.

She had anticipated this scene. In her previous life, Jennifer had publicly accused her of plagiarism, causing her to lose her footing in the industry.

In this life, Christina would not let Jennifer take what rightfully belonged to her.

"Why do you say that?" Christina raised her eyes indifferently. "Plagiarizing your work without changing a single stroke and being caught in public-wouldn't that be foolish?"

"Who knows if you're trying to frame me?" Jennifer snorted coldly. "Besides, I have a bit of a reputation in the industry. Why would I need to plagiarize the work of someone unknown like you?"

In this kind of competition, the audience was generally knowledgeable about the architecture industry, either students or professionals, and they began to whisper among themselves.

"This is definitely plagiarism, but who copied whom?"

"I think Christina plagiarized Jennifer. Jennifer has shown her talent in various competitions before. If you're going to plagiarize, at least do it well. This is embarrassing."

"Isn't that the truth?"

Hearing the public opinion leaning towards her, Jennifer's face showed a confident expression.

"Christina, I know you must have been desperate to do this. If you withdraw from the competition now, I'll plead with Mr. Cavendish to suppress the public opinion, and we'll pretend nothing happened."

Christina found it laughable.

If she took a step back, Jennifer would only press harder until she had no space to survive in the industry.

"I didn't do it, so I'm not afraid. The judges are all industry experts. Why not let them take a good look and see who is really plagiarizing whom?"

"I'm giving you a way out," Jennifer said through gritted teeth.

She had thought that bringing up William would make Christina back down, but even so, she was confident.

The host seemed to have received a signal and began listing Jennifer's past honors.

Already at an advantage, Jennifer now gained even more public support.

The judges came forward to carefully examine the two works, which were almost identical in every stroke.

"It's hard to tell. Kelvin Fisher, what do you think?"

Everyone's eyes turned to one person.

Kelvin was a titan in the field of architectural design, and even two of the judges were his students.

This time, he had agreed to participate because the TV station had given him significant decision-making power.

The host subtly hinted, "Jennifer is already somewhat famous. She has no need to plagiarize."

Kelvin examined the works closely.

"This style seems familiar."

Jennifer's heart skipped a beat, but she thought that Christina shouldn't have any connection with someone like Kelvin, so she boldly said, "I often publish my works. Perhaps you saw one of them during your browsing. It's an honor that my work caught your eye, Mr. Fisher."

"If Mr. Fisher praises the work, it seems Jennifer has a good chance of making it to the top three," the host interjected.

"Do you have any other works?" Kelvin adjusted his glasses.

"What do you mean?" Jennifer froze.

"A person's design style is consistent," Kelvin said, making his point clear.

Jennifer's face turned even more unsightly. "The competition only requires one work. Why would I prepare more? That doesn't seem to fit the judging criteria."

"It doesn't, but isn't there a plagiarism issue now?"

Kelvin looked at the host. "Do I need to discuss this with the organizers before making a final decision?"

The host, not daring to offend him, shook her head with a smile. "The higher-ups said you have the final say in the competition."

"Mr. Fisher, I happen to have a nearly completed work backstage. If you'd like to see it, you can," Christina finally spoke.

Seeing her calm and composed demeanor, Kelvin appreciated her even more. After all, designing required a calm mind.

Kelvin agreed. "Alright, bring it over."

Christina instructed the staff.

A few minutes later, a new work was brought in.

Unfolding it, Kelvin's eyes lit up.

"This architectural design is even better than the one on stage. Why didn't you choose this one?"

"Because it's not finished yet," Christina pointed to a corner of the design. "You see here, due to the need to design fire escape routes and other factors, there are some flaws. I've been thinking about how to make it more perfect."

"You are truly meticulous," Kelvin's eyes showed a hint of admiration.

Seeing them chatting, Jennifer felt a pang of panic and quickly said, "Mr. Fisher, you can't just conclude that I'm the one plagiarizing, can you?"

"I haven't said that," Kelvin, who disliked being interrupted, replied with a stern face.

"You might want to search for my works," Jennifer took a deep breath.

###chapter 34: Did You Do It on Purpose?

Kelvin actually already had an answer in his heart.

However, he still looked at Jennifer's previous works.

But at this moment, he suddenly saw a piece of news, not very famous, but recommended under related entries.

He took a closer look and found that an industry insider had exposed that Jennifer had hired a ghostwriter.

Because she came from a family of literati, the paint she used was exclusively supplied by her family, and no one else had it. Under certain lighting conditions, it could achieve a sparkling effect.

However, some particularly excellent works did not have Jennifer's special mark.

"If it's hard to define, why not talk more about your design philosophy?" Kelvin did not judge who was plagiarizing because of this.

Because in such a highly-watched TV show, he wanted to give the plagiarist a bit of face.

"I'll go first." Jennifer understood the principle of taking the initiative and began to speak eloquently.

"I named this venue the Star Pavilion. In the venue, there is a central point, spreading outwards from the center. The distance between the star angles is 1706.04 feet, symbolizing my love for my fiancé, Mr. Cavendish. How can I tolerate others plagiarizing?"

The audience below was the best atmosphere group, exclaiming in surprise.

"Wow, were we just shown some love?"

"This is so enviable. The architect's love is integrated into the architecture, standing for a hundred years. I support Jennifer."

The audience even started shouting, "Christina, you plagiarist, get off the stage."

Jennifer's confidence grew, and she looked provocatively at Christina.

Christina smiled calmly and combined her two drawings.

"This work is called Embracing the Moon with Stars. Four Star Pavilions surround the crescent Moon Pavilion. During the design process, I fully considered the lighting conditions throughout the year, ensuring that the five pavilions are closely connected while maintaining proper lighting. It symbolizes the vast and infinite universe where humans unite and help each other."

Kelvin nodded appreciatively, "Not bad, this idea is very good, it could even be used as a national pavilion."

Such grand architecture, he seemed to have seen it in a designer before, so he subconsciously asked.

"Could it be that you are Christina?"

After saying this, he repeated Christina's name and exclaimed, "It really is you."

He had seen this designer's work online before. Although the technique was slightly immature, the design philosophy and safety were top-notch, with a promising future.

"Mr. Fisher, I came to participate in this competition today, not wanting my past reputation to be a burden. Now, please pretend you don't know and judge fairly."

Christina said calmly.

Because Kelvin had a microphone, his voice was heard by others.

"No way, is she really Christina? Our teacher showed us her work as an excellent example."

Several architecture students whispered.

For a moment, public opinion reversed.

"Jennifer has a history of using ghostwriters. Maybe she plagiarized this time too?"

"That would be terrible, but I think the ghostwriter did a good job. Otherwise, who would know Jennifer is incapable?"

Everyone laughed.

Jennifer felt like she was sitting on pins and needles on stage.

"Christina, why did you prepare two works? Did you do it on purpose?"

"Better safe than sorry. Besides, I said this was unfinished. I have a habit of carrying unfinished works with me." Christina smiled calmly.

What a joke! She had lived another life. If she wasn't cautious, wouldn't she have lived in vain?

In her previous life, she was driven off the stage by malicious words. In this life, she was fully prepared, even setting a trap for Jennifer to plagiarize her work.

If Jennifer didn't have such intentions, how could she have fallen into her trap step by step? She could only blame herself, no one else!

Kelvin, after carefully commenting on other works, cleared his throat and announced firmly.

"Alright, after everyone's judgment, the gold, silver, and bronze awards have been selected."

The host, not expecting things to develop this way, cleared his throat and said, "Please be quiet. Next, I will announce the winner of this architecture competition."

"The bronze award goes to Dora Carter, applause!"

Then he announced the silver award.

"The silver award goes to Beckett Barnes, congratulations on achieving second place."

The host, after announcing, deliberately elongated his voice, pretending to be mysterious, "Next, I will announce the winner of the gold award."

Everyone held their breath, waiting in anticipation.

In the end, it was not judged who plagiarized whom.

So, the final result was still suspenseful.

The host put on a smile and loudly announced, "The final winner is Christina! Let's congratulate her for overcoming difficulties and defeating her opponents, ultimately reaching the top."

"I don't accept this." Jennifer shouted, "Even if our design philosophies are the same, it doesn't mean I plagiarized. Why don't I have a place?"

Kelvin turned to look at her.

"Your ghostwriting issue has already caused a stir online. You should deal with this most fatal issue for a designer first."

Jennifer's face instantly turned pale.

It's over, everything is over!

Kelvin turned to Christina, smiling kindly, "I'm old and have trained many students. I was planning to retire, but it's rare to see such a talented young student like you. So, I want to ask if you would like to work at the architecture institute with me?"

Christina didn't expect such a reward, feeling both surprised and hesitant, "How can I accept this?"

"What? You don't think I'm good enough?" Kelvin joked.

"Of course not." Christina's voice couldn't hide her excitement, "I just think, would it be too much trouble for you? If I can learn from you, it would be my great fortune."

"No trouble at all. Having a student like you, I'll teach for a few more years, contributing to the country and making the most of my remaining years." Kelvin said with a smile.

A judge who was Kelvin's student immediately chimed in, "Christina, Mr. Fisher rarely personally selects students to mentor these years. This is a great honor. What are you waiting for?"

Christina nodded heavily, "Alright, Mr. Fisher, I also feel I need to improve. If you are willing to mentor me, I would be extremely grateful."

Everyone was happy, and the atmosphere was lively.

The two judges also joked, "From now on, you'll be our junior. Come on, call us seniors."

Christina, a bit embarrassed, still called out, "Teacher, two seniors, please take care of me in the future."

###chapter 35 This Matter Ends Here

Everyone burst into laughter.

Although the rankings had been announced, the event wasn't over yet; there were still some procedures to follow.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Christina carried the golden, heavy trophy that seemed to weigh a thousand pounds in her hands.

The trajectory of fate had quietly changed. In this life, she might be able to take control of everything.

Thinking of this, she raised her head high, a confident and radiant smile on her face, facing the crowd.

In the audience, a pair of eyes watched her.

She didn't care at all, glanced indifferently, raised her head, and accepted the flowers and applause.

Many audience members, organized by the hosts, ran up to the stage and handed her flowers.

"Congratulations, you're amazing."

"Thank you!" Christina nodded slightly.

This scene seemed to have played out countless times in her mind.

She looked up at the sky. They say that deceased children turn into stars. She hoped her Harper was still watching her, with the stars in the sky and the stars on the ground shining together.

"Come on, let's take a photo."

A reporter took out a camera.

Jennifer stood alone on the stage, with no one paying attention to her.

In the audience, William glanced at Bob beside him.

Bob walked up to the stage and approached Jennifer: "Mr. Cavendish wants to see you."

Jennifer held back her grievances and stepped off the stage.

Sitting next to William, she began to wipe her tears.

"They're targeting me. That Christina is so close to Mr. Fisher; she must have given him some benefits in advance."

William pressed his thin lips tightly, saying nothing.

"Mr. Cavendish, you have to help me."

Jennifer cried, "You must investigate thoroughly, cancel the competition results, and re-evaluate."

"Enough." William sternly stopped her.

Jennifer's expression froze.

"Mr. Cavendish, I..."

"This matter ends here," William said coldly.

Bob took out his phone: "Mr. Cavendish, the public opinion..."

Jennifer's face turned ugly, wanting to explain a few words.

But William didn't care at all: "I'll handle the reputation issue for you, but only this once."

"Mr. Cavendish, I knew you wouldn't ignore me." Jennifer stopped crying.

William looked up and coldly said to Bob: "Handle the follow-up matters well, and make sure today's incident doesn't get out. Prepare for the subsequent interviews."

Jennifer finally felt a bit more at ease.

Christina noticed the commotion below and glanced over indifferently.

Jennifer was indeed someone William favored. No matter how much trouble she caused, there was always someone to clean up after her.

But so what?

The road ahead, she would walk step by step!

Relying on herself, she would carve out a successful life.

The related reports would be suppressed, and Jennifer still accepted the post-competition interview.

In her words, she portrayed herself as very magnanimous and stated that she would keep working hard, believing that one day someone would see her brilliance. It was quite late when she finished.

When Christina came out, a group of admirers presented her with flowers.

"You're amazing, Christina. You're my idol. I'll strive to be like you."

"Thank you for your recognition. I hope you succeed too." Christina responded politely.

She had only walked a few steps, and her arms were already full of flowers. More people were trying to give her flowers, and she had to decline.

"Thank you all for your kindness, but I really can't hold any more."

People were a bit disappointed that she didn't accept the gifts.

But unexpectedly, someone in the crowd suddenly shouted.

"Christina, did you cheat?"

The voice was loud, causing everyone to turn their heads in surprise.

It turned out to be a few people causing trouble together.

Then a bouquet of thorny roses was thrown over. Fortunately, Christina dodged quickly and wasn't hurt.

"Did you steal Jennifer's award? How dare you accept flowers here!"

The situation was getting out of hand. Luckily, the venue's security personnel quickly rushed in and dragged the troublemakers out.

As they were being dragged out, they shouted crazily.

"I won't let you get away with this. I'll kill you, you bitch."

It was terrifying. Christina didn't expect there to be irrational fans of Jennifer. Her face turned a bit pale.

As it was getting late, Christina bid farewell to everyone and took a cab home.

As soon as she got out of the cab, a dark figure suddenly rushed out.

The commotion was loud, and she reacted immediately. Glancing sideways, she saw the dark figure holding a knife.

"Help, murder!"

She shouted while running away.

Perhaps because the area was a bit remote, there was almost no one around.

She couldn't outrun a strong man. In no time, the man grabbed her clothes, and the knife in his hand stabbed down.

She leaned back in fright, dodging the knife slightly. It only cut her clothes and didn't hurt her!

"What do you want?"

She questioned while retreating.

But she was already at a dead end, with nowhere to go. Just as Christina felt desperate, the sound of an engine roaring came from not far away.

Just as the man was about to pounce on her, a car suddenly rushed out and knocked the man down.

The driver controlled the force well, only knocking the man down without killing him. The man, still shouting, tried to get up.

Unexpectedly, the person in the car rushed out at this moment, throwing a punch that sent the man crashing to the ground.

Christina saw the knife fall to the side and quickly picked it up, holding it tightly in her hand.

Meanwhile, under the streetlight, she saw who had helped her and exclaimed in surprise, "Walter, is that you? You're back?"

He was Walter Cavendish, the son of the Cavendish family.

He had been abroad, but now he was back and had appeared to help her.

Walter didn't have time to respond. He threw a few more punches, knocking the man unconscious.

After finishing, he clapped his hands and stood up: "Hi, long time no see!"

"Long time no see. What are you doing here?" Christina asked in surprise. "Weren't you abroad?"

"I came back." Walter said with a smile.

"Does your family know?" Christina asked casually.

"No." Walter shook his head.

Christina asked, "Why didn't you tell them?"

"Because I wanted you to be the first to know." Walter smiled.

Christina was stunned for a moment. His words sounded a bit strange, but she didn't think much of it: "How did you know I was here?"

###chapter 36: Being Squeezed

Walter gave a mysterious smile, "Guess."

Christina shook her head and shrugged helplessly, "I can't guess."

"I saw you were going to compete, and I wanted to come back to cheer you on, but the flight was delayed. I figured I'd be late to the venue, so I came straight to find you. How did you do? What place did you get?" Walter asked with a smile.

Christina smiled and replied, "First place, so I didn't let all my hard work go to waste."

"Not bad. We haven't seen each other in a while. How about some late-night snacks?" Walter invited.

Christina glanced at the person lying on the ground, "What about him?"

"Just a small fry, let the police handle it," Walter said nonchalantly, dialing the police.

Then he carefully examined Christina, "Have you been mistreated while I was away? You've lost so much weight."

"No," Christina shook her head.

Walter reached out and pinched her cheek, "You have lost weight."

Christina was stunned for a moment and took a few steps back, "Maybe you should go home and see your family first."

Walter shrugged and chuckled softly, "Alright, I'm just happy that the first person I saw after coming back was you."

Not far away, a pair of cold eyes watched everything.

William squinted his stern eyes.

Early the next morning, Christina went straight to the architecture institute to report.

Kelvin wasn't there.

A group of people, having heard about her, looked at her with scrutinizing eyes as she entered.

Christina greeted them, "I'm the new one."

"You got in through connections, right? Mr. Fisher said he wasn't taking any more students. We've been with Mr. Fisher for years, so why is there a new person?" The tone of the crowd was unfriendly.

"Exactly. Mr. Fisher likes to take students, but it shouldn't delay our progress."

Christina thought Kelvin's students would be as warm and generous as those two seniors, but she didn't expect them to be so exclusionary.

Christina cleared her throat, "Anyway, Mr. Fisher has accepted me."

"People who get in through connections are always so confident," someone mocked.

"I didn't get in through connections," Christina smiled calmly, "I just won the gold medal in the architectural design competition, which is why Mr. Fisher accepted me."

The crowd burst into laughter, "Ask anyone here, who hasn't won a few awards? If you want to prove yourself, don't bring up awards, it's ridiculous."

"Then what should I do?" Christina suppressed her anger.

Being new, she didn't want to alienate these people.

"There's a difficult client here who isn't satisfied with many of our works. Why don't you try? If your work gets his approval and secures the cooperation, you might be able to become Mr. Fisher's student," an older person said, taking a file from the drawer and tossing it on the table in front of her.

"Take a look. If you find it too difficult, you can back out. I'm not forcing you."

With the offer made, adding that last sentence was pointless.

Christina glanced at the file and nodded, "Alright, I'll give it a try."

The crowd watched her with amusement, whispering after she left.

"I think she's overconfident."

"No worries, if she fails, she won't have the face to stay here."

They laughed and joked.

After leaving, Christina called the contact number provided.

She explained her purpose.

The other party chuckled, "Oh, it's that architecture institute. We've dealt with them before, and I wasn't satisfied. No need to contact us again."

"I'm new here. I hope you can look at my work," Christina said sincerely.

"What's your name?" the other party asked casually.

"Christina."

Upon hearing her name, the other party immediately said, "Oh, the recent award winner. Alright, I'll inform our boss."

"Thank you," Christina breathed a sigh of relief, finding things smoother than expected.

The assistant was sharp, having heard his boss mention Christina's name, praising her looks and design style. Unexpectedly, Christina reached out the next day.

After reporting, the boss was delighted and requested a meeting.

Christina soon received a call, confirming the time and place.

They arranged to meet in a hotel suite.

When Christina arrived on time, the person was already there. The assistant introduced, "Ms. Windsor, this is our boss, Harold Saunders."

Christina approached and greeted confidently, "Nice to meet you, Mr. Saunders. I'm Christina."

Harold invited her to sit, "I watched that show. I liked your design."

Christina smiled as she sat, "Really? It must be fate."

"But some aspects don't align with our company's philosophy. We'll need to discuss it further," Harold said, rubbing his chin.

"If we reach a cooperation, you'll be the client, and we'll fully consider your opinions for modifications," Christina cleared her throat.

"Let's have a drink first," Harold signaled his assistant.

The assistant filled their glasses.

"Come on, the night is long, let's take our time."

"I'm not good at drinking," Christina declined with a smile.

Harold's face darkened, "Are you disrespecting me? Fine, I hate people who don't respect me. There's nothing more to discuss."

Christina hesitated, feeling trapped with no way out.

She picked up her glass, "Mr. Saunders, I didn't mean to be rude. I'm just afraid of embarrassing myself if I get drunk. If you don't mind, I'll join you for this one."

"That's more like it. Cheers," Harold clinked glasses and drank.

Seeing him drink, Christina followed suit.

The whiskey's strength made it hard for her to swallow.

"I've reviewed your cooperation requirements. I believe our institute can meet all your needs," Christina said, taking out her portfolio.

"These are my previous works. You can review them before deciding."

Unexpectedly, Harold moved closer, squeezing beside her, his greasy hand brushing hers.

"No rush! Business can be discussed anytime. Look at this beautiful night."

Christina bit her lip, discreetly withdrawing her hand, "Mr. Saunders, if you're not in the mood now, you can take it home to review."

"What's the hurry?" Harold's hand touched hers again.

"Sometimes shortcuts are easier."

###chapter 37: I Think You're About to Die

Christina's face turned cold, and a wave of disgust surged in her heart.

She withdrew her hand but maintained a polite smile on her face, "Mr. Saunders, please behave yourself. We are here to discuss a collaboration."

Seeing Christina's firm attitude, Harold's face turned a bit awkward, but he still forced a smile.

"Oh, young people just don't understand charm. I just think you're great and want to get closer to you."

Christina understood clearly that once she compromised, it would mean losing her principles.

She suppressed her discomfort and said calmly, "Mr. Saunders, if you really think my design is good, we should communicate on a professional level. Please respect me, and that is also respecting yourself."

Harold was angered by Christina's attitude, and the smile on his face gradually disappeared, becoming somewhat fierce.

"You woman, how arrogant. Who do you think you are? You're just a small designer, and you really think you're somebody."

Christina stood up and looked at Harold calmly.

"Mr. Saunders, if this is how you view collaboration, then I don't think there's any need for us to continue talking. Goodbye."

Harold, however, blocked the door before she could leave, "Want to leave? Too late!"

Christina stood up but suddenly felt a bit dizzy, with a burning sensation in her chest.

She immediately realized that there was something wrong with the wine.

She smashed the wine bottle and pointed the broken edge at her neck, "Fine, if you won't let me leave, we'll both suffer. If I die here, with all the evidence on the scene, do you think you can get away with it?"

Her fierce and ruthless demeanor startled Harold.

He dared to do such things, but getting involved in a death...

"Come on!" Christina's eyes glinted fiercely.

Harold chickened out, stepped back, and let her pass.

"Fine, well done. You'll never get this collaboration."

"Who cares about collaborating with someone like you." Christina suppressed her discomfort, picked up her belongings, and quickly walked out the door.

She feared that if she delayed even a moment, she would fall into an abyss.

She finally got out, and the cool air made her a bit more clear-headed, but her steps became increasingly unsteady.

Uncomfortable, so uncomfortable!

She struggled to an empty place, but the burning sensation in her heart continued to consume her.

She couldn't bear it any longer and started tearing at her clothes, seeking some coolness.

But just then, the door to the fire escape suddenly opened.

William appeared at the door, looking at her with cold, mocking eyes.

"What's wrong with you?"

"Go away! Close the door." Christina was about to lose control but didn't want him to see her in such a state.

William approached, speaking mockingly, "You look like you're about to die."

"You'll die first!" Christina bit her lip and forced out a few words through clenched teeth.

"Still being stubborn at this point. Beg me, and I'll help you."

As he spoke, William had already walked up to her.

Christina felt only embarrassment and shame, but she gritted her teeth and coldly retorted, "Dream on! I'd rather beg a dog outside than beg you."

William's expression changed instantly.

He grabbed Christina's jaw harshly and said mockingly, "It seems you need a lesson to know your place."

With that, he kissed her forcefully.

Christina's mind went blank, and her body felt like it was on fire, waves of heat making her unable to resist.

William's kiss was like a storm, punishing and suffocating her.

She struggled to push him away, but her strength seemed to be drained, making her efforts futile.

She could only bite down hard.

William let go of her in pain, smiling faintly, a drop of blood blooming on his lips, looking both seductive and sinister.

"I'd rather die than have anything to do with you," Christina said fiercely.

"You really are like a hedgehog." William laughed, scooping her up.

Christina was terrified, struggling frantically, "What are you doing? Let me go!"

"If you move again, I'll take you in front of everyone and let them see your predicament."

William threatened maliciously.

Christina felt like she was about to burst into flames.

If she was seen by everyone, it would be even more humiliating. She had no choice but to endure, letting him take her to the car and then back to the villa, where he threw her onto a soft bed.

She thought he was going to do something to her and retreated a few steps, curling up in the corner, watching him warily.

William looked at her sheepish expression and burst into laughter, "You think too highly of yourself."

With that, he turned and left. Only after hearing the door close did Christina breathe a sigh of relief.

Her body felt like it was about to explode. He wouldn't hate her so much that he would leave her here to fend for herself, would he?

As she was lost in thought, the door opened again.

Joseph walked in quickly.

Seeing Christina, he clicked his tongue in sympathy.

Seeing him, Christina relaxed a bit. Even though they didn't get along, he was a doctor and had some medical ethics.

Joseph quickly took out his medical kit and started an IV, then said sarcastically, "Why is it always you? Why are you always getting hurt?"

"I don't want to either," Christina said hoarsely, "Besides, is it any of your business?"

Joseph pouted, "I should have taken my time getting here, let you suffer more. Otherwise, how would you still be so talkative?"

"Whatever," Christina said indifferently.

She had to admit, the IV made her feel much better.

Slowly, her blood seemed to cool down.

Joseph took her temperature.

"You're fine. Just remove the IV when it's done."

"Then you can leave now," William said coldly.

"What, am I just your tool? You use me and then discard me. Fine, I won't disturb you." Joseph sighed and left.

The room was instantly filled with awkward silence.

Christina glanced at William, "I'm fine now. You can leave."

William didn't leave immediately but sat by the bed, looking at Christina with a complex expression.

"Do you think I wanted to save you?" he said coldly.

Anger surged in Christina's heart. She glared at William and said through gritted teeth, "Whether you save me or not, it makes no difference to me. I won't thank you, nor will I hate you."

William smiled, a smile filled with an elusive coldness and mockery.

###chapter 38: So, you're saying I'm meddling in other people's business?

Christina turned her head away and stopped looking at William.

However, when you hate someone, even their breathing next to you feels suffocating.

Christina impatiently said, "Can you get out of my sight? Now that something has happened to Jennifer, shouldn't you be with her?"

"Don't forget, if it weren't for me, you would now..."

"So I should thank you?"

Christina interrupted with a cold laugh.

What good is it that William helped her this time?

She would never forget the painful experiences of her past life. No matter what William did, Harper could never come back to her.

Harper's hopes, disappointments, and pain-she would never forget any of it!

William squinted his eyes, "Is your hostility towards me that great?"

Christina had changed so much from before, not just towards him, but also towards Jennifer, and even her own mother, including Missy.

If this weren't the 21st century, he would really suspect that Christina's body had been taken over by another soul.

"Since you can feel it, why do you still interfere with me?" Christina spoke bluntly.

She had no good feelings towards William, only endless hatred. She wouldn't be grateful and worship William as a god just because of a small favor.

It was the first time William had seen a woman as ungrateful as Christina.

"Who is interfering with whom?"

William's eyes darkened.

Christina didn't speak.

In William's eyes, her first involvement with him was very abrupt. Then there were the things she did, reporting Jennifer, entering the competition herself.

Including at the school gate, where she accidentally got into his car, and now, he thought she did it on purpose.

"I have no intention of interfering with you. If you want to help, that's your business."

Although these words were annoying, they also made William unhappy.

William's face darkened, and he sneered, "So, I'm meddling in other people's business?"

Christina didn't speak.

But silence meant acquiescence.

William called Bob, "Bring that man in and have him recreate the scene."

William hung up the phone and turned to leave.

Christina really didn't expect William to go this far, recreating the scene-was this a movie?

But William was serious.

The half-dead Harold was thrown in front of Christina. Seeing Christina, Harold begged repeatedly, "Ms. Windsor, I didn't know your relationship with Mr. Cavendish. Please ask Mr. Cavendish to let me go, I beg you."

Harold didn't dare do anything to her.

Christina sneered, but before she could say anything, William's voice came from not far away, "The condition for letting you go is to do it like before."

"What?"

Harold was completely stunned.

Like before?

Christina wouldn't give Harold this chance, and she wouldn't give William the chance to watch the show either. She coldly said, "Only someone like you would have such a perverted hobby."

The next second, she stepped forward and grabbed Harold by the collar, "Only scum like you!"

Then, Christina kicked Harold in the stomach.

Harold let out a miserable scream, "I already know I was wrong. Why are you still hitting me? Do you want me to die? Besides, every industry has its rules. If you don't know this, what are you doing here?"

"So you're saying it's my fault?" Christina punched him twice more.

She was using Harold as a punching bag to vent her anger, but she also realized that in this life, she had many things to do and would inevitably face many unknown dangers.

She had to learn some self-defense skills. Otherwise, just like with William, he could easily break her hand.

If she knew martial arts, William wouldn't even be able to get close to her.

Harold cried out in pain, "I didn't say it was your fault. I've already apologized. And I've been beaten like this. What more do you want? Do you really want me to die?"

"I'm not asking you to die, but you should suffer."

Christina said as she continued to hit him.

She was venting her anger and also treating Harold as if he were William.

Seeing Christina hitting so happily, William's face darkened.

He had intended to punish Christina for thinking he was meddling, but instead, he had given her a convenient way to vent her anger.

Bob, who was behind him, had already realized this. William's special treatment of Christina was not a good sign!

But now, he didn't dare say anything.

Christina got tired of hitting, and Harold was left barely alive. Christina pointed at his nose, "What you call a common phenomenon doesn't work with me. From now on, if you see me, go the other way!"

"Okay."

Harold used his last bit of strength to respond to Christina.

Harold was dragged away, leaving only Christina and William in the room.

But the two didn't communicate. William's thin lips were tightly pressed into a straight line, his eyes coldly fixed on Christina, with a hint of sharpness.

"You've finished watching the show. Is there anything else?"

Christina spoke indifferently.

At that moment, her meaning was clear: if William had nothing else, he could leave.

William's voice came out from his nose, "You want to leave after using me? Who taught you to do things this way?"

"No one taught me. I just don't want to have any contact with you. In case you think I'm seducing you, deliberately approaching you. I have a reputation to maintain."

Christina's voice was cold. At this moment, she didn't want to see William at all.

Hating someone truly comes from the heart, and that sense of repulsion is impossible to suppress.

William seemed to hear the biggest joke, "Reputation? Do you still have a reputation?"

"Why wouldn't I have a reputation?"

She had already explained what needed to be explained. If people wanted to attack her, that was their business and had nothing to do with her.

William didn't respond, but the sarcasm at the corners of his mouth became more apparent.

Christina hated William's contemptuous and superior attitude. Seeing William unmoved, Christina didn't want to struggle with him verbally.

But just as she was about to bypass William, he grabbed her wrist, "Where are you going?"

"Uncle, I asked you to leave, but you didn't. I know your status is high, and it's hard to listen to me. If you don't leave, then I have to go." Christina coldly mocked.

William's expression was extremely unpleasant, and his eyes seemed to reflect endless sharpness, "Christina, are you looking for death?"

###chapter 39: "What do you want so early in the morning?"

Christina struggled, unable to shake off William due to the difference in strength between men and women.

This sense of powerlessness and anger made her increasingly aware that she must learn self-defense and combat skills. It was very necessary.

Unfortunately, her other hand still couldn't muster much strength.

She feared that even if she cried out for help, no one would come to her rescue with Bob guarding outside.

Christina gave up, "Yes, I want to die. Uncle, give me a quick death. It would be good for both you and me."

"Then you won't have to suspect that I have any ulterior motives to seduce you."

William sneered, "And then I go to jail and get the punishment I deserve?"

Christina smiled broadly, "Oh, Uncle, you're so smart! Have you studied me? Or is it that you..."

"Get out!"

Christina knew exactly where William's bottom line was.

As soon as she said this, William indeed became furious and threw her aside. She stumbled and almost fell. Fortunately, she didn't.

However, Christina took advantage of the situation and quickly left.

Tonight, she wanted to resist for once and found a hotel to stay in.

What she didn't expect was to run into Walter there.

Walter walked towards her with large strides, clearly noticing her.

"What are you doing here?" Walter frowned.

This was a hotel.

Moreover, Walter saw the documents in Christina's hand and immediately understood that she was here to check in.

The matter between Christina and William had caused quite a stir in the Cavendish family, but only the Cavendish family knew about it. Someone like Walter, who was abroad, wouldn't have been informed by Gabrielle.

"I left the Cavendish Mansion. I haven't found a place to stay yet."

She couldn't possibly tell Walter that her entanglement with William was the reason she didn't want to stay at William's villa.

Walter's gaze was so gentle and kind, "Did you have a fight with your mom?"

"No, I just wanted to leave the Cavendish Mansion. I haven't been very happy there these past few years. Alright, Walter, you're busy, so I'll head to my room now."

She had already checked in and paid.

Walter understood Christina's situation and didn't say much. But a girl being out so late, Walter couldn't help but give a few more reminders, "Lock your door when you sleep tonight, and don't order any takeout. Wait until tomorrow to go out for food."

"Okay."

Christina nodded and was about to turn away when Walter called out to her again, "Christina, wait. We haven't exchanged contact information. Let's do that. If I have time tomorrow, I can help you find a place."

Walter was one of the few people in the Cavendish family who treated her well.

But how could she trouble him?

"Walter, you helped me last time. How can I trouble you again this time? Besides, I can stay at school and find a job that provides room and board. You go ahead with your work."

If she accepted Walter's kindness and Gabrielle found out, wouldn't she go crazy?

And she hadn't even moved out of William's villa yet. If she started looking for a place so soon, wouldn't William kill her?

But they did add each other on Facebook.

Christina was really tired. As soon as she got to her room, she lay down on the bed and fell into a deep sleep. William called her.

It was obvious that William was calling to scold her.

She pressed the mute button and tossed her phone aside.

No matter how many times William called or tried to find her, she was a person and deserved her own freedom.

When William saw that Christina wasn't answering, he immediately instructed Bob, "Find out where Christina is now."

Since Christina hadn't turned off her phone, locating her was a matter of minutes.

Bob reported truthfully, "Ms. Windsor is at a bed and breakfast hotel. Should we go get her now?"

William had asked him to locate Christina, clearly intending to go find her directly.

William's face was dark, his lips pressed into a thin line. But before he could say anything, Bob spoke up, "Mr. Cavendish, it's best not to go now. It's already very late. If we make a scene, it might attract media attention."

"If that happens, it could cause endless trouble for your reputation, Mr. Cavendish, and it might be hard to control."

Bob had been with William for many years. He had benefited from William's kindness and experienced his severity, but he knew what kind of person William was.

He didn't want to see William affected by such a small matter.

William said coldly, "Arrange for someone to pick her up tomorrow."

"Yes."

With William's orders, Bob had nothing more to say.

Without William and given how tired she was, Christina had a good night's sleep.

She woke up naturally.

As she was about to get up and wash, there was a knock on the door.

Christina looked through the peephole and saw several bodyguards in black suits, led by Bob.

Christina immediately understood that they were sent by William to bring her back.

Christina was speechless. She didn't open the door, and the knocking stopped. But she knew that if she didn't open the door, Bob would get a key card from the front desk.

Realizing this, Christina quickly opened the door and called William.

William didn't answer, so she called again.

This time, William's cold voice came through the phone, "What do you want so early in the morning?"

Christina laughed at William's words, "What do you want so early in the morning? What, I don't have my own freedom? In just a few days, have you seen my belly grow from pregnancy or morning sickness?"

Even if she had to stay at his place for half a month, it wasn't like she was a prisoner.

"Half a month hasn't passed yet. Do I need to remind you repeatedly?" William's face was dark, clearly impatient.

All his patience had been exhausted by Christina.

Christina coldly retorted, "I don't need you to remind me repeatedly. I have a memory, unlike you, who has no sense of security. Otherwise, you wouldn't keep doing these things."

Christina was really angry. Otherwise, she wouldn't be arguing with William. She wasn't as idle as William!

"Christina, don't push me to lay a hand on you!"

###chapter 40: All Blame on Him

Christina was infuriated by William's words, "Haven't you ever laid a hand on me?"

Her hand was broken by him, and it still wasn't fully functional.

Moreover, William had acted like he was going to kill her in front of her mother, no, in front of everyone, forcibly keeping her by his side.

William never feared anyone and never took her seriously.

To William, she was just a scheming woman trying to seduce him into sex and even using her pregnancy to force him into marriage to become wealthy.

Christina wasn't afraid of William laying a hand on her, "If you have the guts, kill me. I won't go with your people; I have my own plans. If you force me..."

Christina deliberately paused, then continued, "William, you wouldn't want me to call the police or publicly announce our relationship, would you?"

"You wouldn't dare."

The cold words squeezed out from William's teeth.

Christina laughed, "Why wouldn't I? You've been targeting me everywhere, so why can't I fight back?"

With that, Christina hung up the phone.

However, Bob was William's trusted confidant.

With Bob and his men around, taking Christina away and preventing her from calling the police was a piece of cake.

Although Bob didn't want to bring Christina to William, William had already given the order.

Christina was practically dragged in front of William by Bob and his men without even washing up.

She didn't know any basic self-defense, let alone against Bob's professionally trained men.

Seeing William in the villa, Christina immediately started with sarcasm, "They say a day apart feels like years. How long has it been since we last saw each other?"

Seeing William's increasingly displeased expression, Christina felt extremely pleased and satisfied.

Early in the morning, William made her unhappy, so she would make William unhappy.

Before William could speak, Bob's low warning came from behind, "Ms. Windsor, if you don't want to suffer, you better show some respect to Mr. Cavendish."

Respect?

William had never respected her, so why should she respect William?

"William hasn't even spoken yet."

Christina's words were full of sarcasm.

Bob had been with William the longest, and William trusted him. In her previous life, when Harper had a fever and she couldn't reach William, she had called Bob.

But what did Bob say?

"Mrs. Cavendish, even I can't be fooled by such a lowly trick, let alone Mr. Cavendish."

She cried and begged Bob, but Bob didn't care and hung up the phone immediately.

Bob, Missy, Joseph, Jennifer, she would never forget these four people!

Bob was choked by her words. He had meant to remind Christina, but Christina didn't appreciate it!

Bob shut his mouth.

From now on, he wouldn't meddle anymore. He wanted to see how miserable Christina would be later.

Soon, only Christina and William were left in the living room.

William was still lazily sitting on the sofa, but his eyes were filled with a dead silence, "It seems you've been quite arrogant lately."

Since that night, Christina had changed. She would sarcastically respond to anything.

Christina's lips curled into a sneer, "It's not arrogance; I'm protecting my own interests. You asked me to stay in your villa, and I did. I haven't involved you in anything I do, so why do you always think I want to have your child?"

Christina was exasperated, "If you really don't believe me, why don't I start taking birth control pills every day from now on?"

It had been several days since that night, and taking birth control pills now was completely unnecessary.

If William agreed, he would be no different from a fool.

William's face was extremely ugly, "Do you think you're smart?"

"I don't think I'm smart; I just feel helpless. In the Cavendish Mansion, no one believes me. After I leave, you still restrict my freedom."

"I'm a person, not an object. You keep saying I'm scheming against you, but aren't you scheming against me?"

"You say you're afraid I'll get pregnant and bring me to your villa. But in reality, you're just satisfying your own desires. Uncle, were you really not clear-headed that night?"

"And the few times I got into trouble, you were always conveniently around. How could it be such a coincidence?"

That night, William was indeed drugged and not clear-headed, unable to recognize her.

She knew William never had any feelings for her and just wanted to make sure she wasn't pregnant. But she deliberately said it this way.

She wanted to argue until William couldn't respond.

"Uncle, if you like this kind of forbidden love, with your ability, you can find many. I beg you, don't interfere with me anymore."

"I had such a hard time in the Cavendish Mansion, I just want to survive. Is that so difficult?"

The more Christina spoke, the more helpless she felt.

William's eyes narrowed, "Enough, don't make yourself sound so innocent. If you want to stay in the villa to be observed, then stay properly."

Her frequent outings causing trouble, what was that about?

He didn't have the time to keep solving her problems.

William didn't say much, but Christina could read everything from his expression.

"Uncle, I can tell you clearly, if you want me to stay, I'm just cooperating with you. But I also have the right to refuse."

"If I have the right to refuse, why don't I have the right to act on my own?"

Christina's eyes were full of arrogance.

William's face darkened, as if a thick layer of gloom had settled over him.

But before he could say anything, his phone rang.

It was Jennifer calling.

Jennifer's voice was hoarse, "William."

Since the Golden Cup incident, Jennifer's reputation had plummeted. The architecture institute had fired her, and even the publishing house was scrutinizing her published books.

She stayed at home every day, not daring to go out.

She had texted William, but he didn't reply. With no other option, she called him. At this moment, she was outside William's villa.

As long as William agreed, she could come in immediately.

"Say what you need to say." William's tone was cold, so cold it was as if he had become a different person.

Jennifer felt a pang of heartache. William wasn't like this before, but now, Jennifer knew it was all because of Christina.

Since that night when Christina took the initiative, and William brought Christina to his villa, everything had changed.

###chapter 41: "I'm talking to William, what does it have to do with you?"

But now, Jennifer could only suppress her emotions.

She took a deep breath and then said, "William, I'm outside your villa right now. Can I come in? There are some things I want to say to you in person."

"Come in."

Jennifer was already outside; he couldn't possibly stop her from coming in.

Jennifer moved quickly.

She knew Christina was in William's villa, but the moment she walked in and saw Christina, her inner resentment and dissatisfaction grew infinitely.

"Christina, are you satisfied now? You framed me and got me expelled from the architecture institute, you entered the institute yourself, and became Mr. Fisher's apprentice. Now you're even living in William's villa."

Jennifer laughed sarcastically.

Her gaze was provocative and contemptuous, as if saying to Christina, "Don't think you've won. The future is still uncertain."

Christina crossed her arms and smiled sweetly, "Yes, I'm very satisfied now. Not only did I get in, but I also removed a pest from society. There's nothing wrong with that."

"As for me living in Uncle's villa, it was Uncle who personally brought me here. If you're unhappy, take it up with Uncle. Don't sarcastically mock me."

"I didn't even want to come. This morning, Uncle specifically sent Bob to bring me here. Maybe that's the difference."

"Uncle, despite the rumors, if you want to marry me, I wouldn't mind at all."

She had no intention of marrying William.

She said this entirely to provoke Jennifer.

Jennifer was the creator of all the tragedies. What Jennifer was experiencing now was nothing compared to what she had gone through in her past life.

"Christina, go back to your room," William said with a dark expression, throwing the words at Christina.

Christina had no interest in their entanglement, but before leaving, she had to make Jennifer feel worse.

She smiled and said, "It's still comfortable living in Uncle's villa. Jennifer, if you want to come, you better hurry. Otherwise, I might really become William's wife in the eyes of others."

Christina left, leaving freely, but her words and her departure deeply rooted in Jennifer's heart.

The main thing was that William didn't stop Christina from saying those words.

What did that mean? Was he tacitly agreeing?

Jennifer was really worried that in the end, it wouldn't be her staying by William's side, but Christina!

"William, look at her. She used schemes to ruin my reputation. I can't stay in the architecture institute anymore. Now she wants to do this to me, but she's your nominal niece. Are you really going to marry her?" Jennifer was so unbalanced.

She had made so much effort over the years to stay by William's side, and in the end, everything was benefiting that bitch Christina!

William's face was cold, and his words carried a hint of displeasure, "When did I ever say I was going to marry her?"

William's expression didn't seem fake.

But if William wasn't going to marry Christina, why did he place Christina in his own villa? Like Christina had just proudly said, he even arranged for Bob to personally pick her up!

And then there were the rumors outside.

One rumor spreads to ten, ten to a hundred.

In the end, wouldn't it be said that Christina was William's kept mistress?

William and Christina, a forbidden love, and so on.

Jennifer couldn't stay calm thinking about this, "I'm afraid the situation will develop to the point where you have no choice but to marry her. William, it's all my fault. If it weren't for me..."

Jennifer lowered her head, her voice hoarse, and tears fell like broken pearls.

William didn't like people crying in front of him, but Jennifer had cried many times.

Before, William would comfort Jennifer.

This time, William frowned and said coldly, "Crying is useless. You were expelled from the architecture institute, and I can't help you with that."

"I was just momentarily confused. My previous work..."

Jennifer didn't expect William to still have this attitude. After the competition scandal was exposed, William had been very cold towards her.

She knew that William hated deceitful people the most.

She didn't dare to say much more.

But a day had passed, and she thought William would have calmed down, and she just needed to act as usual. But what was the result?

William didn't even want to hear her continue, "What you're saying is useless. In the Golden Cup Award, you plagiarized, you hired a ghostwriter. Jennifer, the architecture institute is a national institution, and the competition was live-streamed, with so many eyes watching. Do you think I have the power to get you back into the institute?"

If it were a company, he could have kept Jennifer, but this was the architecture institute!

Jennifer saw that William was angry and quickly explained, "That's not what I meant. William, I'm just worried about you. I can have no future, but should your future be ruined because of Christina?"

"You've seen the rumors about you and Christina."

William hated baseless rumors the most.

"So, you came here just to remind me that I can't keep Christina here?" William squinted his eyes, his long gaze falling on Jennifer.

Tears were still welling up in Jennifer's eyes.

Jennifer was crying miserably.

But she quickly waved her hand to deny, "Not entirely. I just missed you and wanted to see you. And I know you're very angry about the competition incident."

Her image in front of William had always been good, but now, because of this incident, her image had plummeted. She came to restore her image, which was her main purpose.

But William didn't seem to have the patience to listen to her.

At this moment, Christina's voice came from above, "Jennifer, I find you very good at talking. Why don't you just say what you want to do?"

"Your goal is to restore your image in William's eyes and see if William can help you get back into the architecture institute!"

Christina had long seen through Jennifer's intentions. Since she wanted to make Jennifer unhappy, she would make sure it went all the way.

Jennifer's face changed dramatically. She looked at Christina, who was leaning on the railing, looking down leisurely.

Christina's lips curled into a smile, even a bit smug.

Seeing this, Jennifer couldn't control her anger. She even wanted to rush up and tear Christina apart.

She gritted her teeth, "Christina, what does it have to do with you when I'm talking to William?"

###chapter 42: Christina, Are You Courting Death?

Christina's smile didn't fade, "It's none of my business, but it's hard not to hear what you're saying when it reaches my ears."

"Ms. Spencer, just tell me, is what I'm saying true?"

Christina's smile didn't reach her eyes.

This expression made Jennifer extremely angry. She had tried so hard to move into William's villa but failed, while Christina moved in so easily and was so arrogant about it.

William hadn't said a word yet. Was he tacitly approving of everything Christina did?

Jennifer could only suppress the anger in her heart. She turned to look at William, crying miserably, "William, I didn't expect it to be like this. I know, you always thought I was good, that I didn't quite deserve it. I really do want to go back to the School of Architecture. I stayed there for so long."

Jennifer was only exposed in a scandal during a competition, even if she had someone ghostwrite for her. She had been in the School of Architecture for a long time, and Jennifer also had the connections her father had accumulated.

Her father had clearly told her to avoid the current storm and then return to the School of Architecture later.

But for Jennifer, this was torture.

The School of Architecture was full of talent. Every day she didn't go, many people were desperately trying to get in, and Christina had already been taken as an apprentice by Kelvin.

She was very anxious.

That's why she thought of coming to William, hoping he could get her into the School of Architecture directly.

Who would have thought, Christina was here saying these things, intensifying the conflict, disrupting her plans!

William didn't speak. He looked up, his eyes narrowing as he looked at Christina.

Christina's smile didn't fade a bit, her eyes even looked provocative, as if saying, "See, I'm right."

"I don't get it. You've been with William for so long. If you want something, can't you just tell him directly? All these twists and turns, don't you find it tiring?"

"Christina, if you don't want me to lose my temper, go back to your room immediately." William's angry shout, with a look of oppression, immediately swept towards Christina.

Christina wasn't scared off by William. Instead, she had already left an indelible mark in Jennifer's heart, achieving her goal of making Jennifer uncomfortable.

Jennifer's nails dug deeply into her flesh, and at this moment, anger surged within her chest.

Really, for the first time, she wanted to kill someone, no, she wanted to tear Christina to pieces!

"Everyone makes mistakes. I can't interfere with your choices." William spoke lightly, pulling Jennifer's thoughts back.

Jennifer looked at William in disbelief, "William, are you trying to distance yourself from me?"

William's expression was indifferent.

William was known for his cold and distant personality, but he had never treated her like this before.

Jennifer was truly scared.

"I said, if you have any difficulties, I will help you."

William's tone didn't change.

This was a promise William had made early on, just because she had saved him once. But back then, she had only taken advantage of the situation.

However, William was so outstanding. From the first time she saw him, she had fallen in love with him at first sight.

It wasn't really about her saving him, it was her secret!

Jennifer's throat felt like it was blocked, "William, what I want most now is to return to the School of Architecture. And, if you don't want to take responsibility for Christina, can you let me stay? You know, my only wish is to marry you."

Jennifer opened her arms and hugged William.

She cried softly in his arms.

In the past, Jennifer had hugged William before, and William didn't feel much, the most he did was pat her shoulder or back.

She wanted him to marry her, and he had agreed.

But now, William felt a bit impatient, probably because he saw Jennifer's tears.

"Too many things have happened recently. Let's put the marriage on hold for now. As for the School of Architecture, you can't go back at this critical moment."

"But where should I go?"

She couldn't continue to submit manuscripts to the publisher for now. The editor said that if she wanted to submit, she had to change her pen name.

That pen name had taken her years to build up. Change it? She was unwilling.

William's voice was calm, "If you feel you have nothing to do recently, you can stay by my side and do some work."

"Okay."

There had never been a female secretary by William's side. If she stayed by his side, she could seize the opportunity. She needed to find a chance to have a relationship with William.

Previously, Christina had taken advantage of the situation. She knew that this time, it wasn't just about having a relationship with William. She had to get pregnant with William's child so that he would marry her.

"Then I..."

Jennifer spoke hesitantly.

She actually wanted to stay.

Unexpectedly, William had no intention of letting her stay, and even said, "You should go back. I'll notify you when there's a schedule."

"Okay."

Since William said so, she couldn't say more.

She left unwillingly.

Now, she could only wait and find another way later.

As for Christina.

Although she didn't continue to stand by the railing, she didn't go back to her room either. She listened to their conversation from a corner where William and Jennifer couldn't see her.

Look, as long as Jennifer cried a little in front of him, William had no resistance at all. But when she had cried her heart out in front of William with her daughter, William hadn't softened, not even for the child. She was more determined to drag Jennifer into hell.

Because that way, Jennifer would be in pain, and William wouldn't have it easy either!

"Come out."

William's cold voice hit Christina, bringing her thoughts back. She walked out, smiling at William, "Uncle, you know me so well."

William's eyes flashed with a deadly coldness, "Why do you have such hostility towards her? You can't break us up just because you want to."

"What hostility do I have towards her? I just don't like her and speak the truth. If you don't like it, don't listen. After all, you have the right not to listen to me."

Christina was unaffected, her smile even deepened, "Or, Uncle, are you too focused on me? Are you addicted to me now?"

Jennifer was already furious, so William had to use some means here too.

If she didn't torment these two, how could she make up for the pain she and Harper had suffered?

The next second, William was indeed furious, "Christina, you're asking for death."

###chapter 43: Then Live Humbly and Low-Key

William took a big step forward, and Christina immediately retreated. She said, "I'm just telling the truth. Are you so angry because you're embarrassed?"

Christina moved quickly too. She immediately pushed open the door and entered the room.

No matter how angry William was, it was impossible for him to chase after her.

Unexpectedly, William pushed the door with his hand, and it opened.

William's eyes flashed with endless cold light. "Christina, have I ever told you not to try to challenge my bottom line here?"

"You did, but I'm also telling the truth. You can't see through Jennifer, so I'm helping you see her clearly. There's nothing wrong with that." Christina saw William's increasingly fierce eyes.

Let William be furious. No matter how angry he gets, she would only suffer a little physical pain.

But William, he would be affected by her words.

William's anger surged, and the next second, he grabbed Christina's wrist and pulled her in front of him.

It was still the hand he had broken before.

"I see Jennifer clearly, and then I fall for you, right?" William's cold tone squeezed out from between his teeth.

Her hand hadn't fully healed, and now William was using so much force again.

The pain made her tremble.

But she still didn't give in. "I never said that. You always like to misinterpret my words. Including me staying here, that's because you're too crazy!"

"William, if you kill me, you won't have a good time either."

William sneered and threw Christina away harshly.

Caught off guard, Christina's head hit the edge of the bed.

Fortunately, the bed was soft, and she didn't hit anything hard.

William's eyes stared coldly at Christina. "I'm not that stupid."

Christina's mother, Elisa, was still at the Cavendish Mansion. If he really did something to Christina, Elisa would be the first to not let it go. He didn't have the time to deal with Elisa's daily tantrums.

"Yeah, you're very shrewd, shrewd enough not to miss any opportunity." Christina's mouth curved into a deep sneer.

William said coldly, "I don't need your evaluation of my shrewdness. Just do your part and don't act like the mistress of the house. You don't have that qualification."

Christina clicked her tongue twice. "Me acting like the mistress? Even if you wanted me to be your mistress, I wouldn't agree."

This reminded her of what she told her mother that day: she would rather marry a dog than marry William.

She was truly disappointed and hated William to the extreme.

"Don't say you wouldn't. You don't have the qualification. From now on, correct your identity and attitude. Here, live humbly and low-key."

After saying this, William turned and left without looking back.

His indifference was deeply imprinted in Christina's eyes.

Christina's mouth curved into a deep sneer.

Live humbly and low-key to please William? No way!

On Jennifer's side.

On her way home, she made a call, sounding frantic. "I can't care about anything else now. I want her dead. I must make her die!"

Only if Christina died would William not have so many exceptions for her, and she could still be the only one by William's side like before.

Even if Nicholas didn't like her, how many more years could Nicholas live? She could wait, she could outlast Nicholas.

And one more thing!

She was pregnant, and Nicholas would never let a Cavendish family child be left out in the cold.

After a while, Jennifer's face changed dramatically. "I don't care about all that. These are just excuses to me. Christina is not difficult for you at all."

"Stop giving me so many excuses. My only thought now is to make Christina die." Only if Christina died would everything settle down.

"I can't wait any longer."

This person told her to wait, that person told her to wait. How long was she supposed to wait?

Wait until Christina was firmly established in the architecture institute, wait until Christina became famous, or wait until Christina and William walked down the aisle?

No, she couldn't wait any longer. She was now eager to kill Christina. Her eyes were filled with endless ferocity. "Within this month, I must make Christina die."

After saying this, Jennifer hung up the phone with a snap.

She threw her phone onto the console. Even if Christina didn't die, she had to make Christina pay a painful price.

On Christina's side, she washed up and sprayed some medicine on her hand.

Joseph was indeed a professional. After a period of plaster consolidation, she removed it herself, and the medicine promoted blood circulation and removed blood stasis.

But William really didn't know how to control his strength!

She lay on the bed, thinking about her next plan.

In this life, without children, she had already won the Golden Cup Award. Next was the art competition, which had been postponed repeatedly.

But she was still determined to win.

She just didn't expect her mother to call at this time.

Since the last time at the hospital, when Christina's blind date with Zachary failed, Elisa had been bedridden at home in anger. Now calling Christina meant she had calmed down.

Christina answered, speaking bluntly, "Let me tell you first, if you're calling to talk about blind dates, then forget it."

Not mentioning blind dates was fine, but as soon as blind dates were mentioned, Elisa remembered what happened at the hospital that day.

She immediately became furious. "Christina, do you think you can avoid blind dates like this? You're ruining your future, do you know that? What you did has already ruined your reputation. Who would want to be with you?"

Zachary was the only son of the Bennett Family. Although Raymond had spoken to the Bennett Family, who knew what Zachary really thought?

Christina chuckled. "Isn't that just perfect? You can also have some peace and live well with Raymond."

Although the Cavendish family didn't treat her well and didn't respect her mother, Raymond was genuinely good to Elisa.

Christina still blessed them.

Elisa was choked by Christina's words. She originally wanted to lecture Christina, but instead, she was scolded by Christina.

What was this?

Christina made her feel like she was meddling in other people's business.

Elisa wanted to say more, but Christina spoke first, "Mom, I'm only 21 years old. I have a clear plan for my future. If you can't help me, then don't cause me trouble."

After saying this, Christina hung up the phone.

Listening to the busy tone, Elisa felt a heavy weight on her chest, as if a huge stone was pressing down, making it hard to breathe.

But what could she do? She could only slowly think of a way.

###chapter 44 Kaitlyn

Christina got up early and left William's villa while he wasn't paying attention. She spent some time on the road and arrived at the architecture institute right on time.

When everyone saw her, they raised their eyebrows and mocked, "I thought you'd be too embarrassed to show up."

Wasn't that indirectly calling her shameless?

Yes, she did mess up the collaboration, but she would rather not work with such people.

"Mr. Saunders already said that you started acting like a diva as soon as you got a bit of fame. There's no chance of future collaborations, and you can leave now."

A woman sneered.

If she hadn't come today, they would have thought Christina didn't dare to show up.

Just as Christina was about to speak, Kelvin arrived, accompanied by a young and beautiful girl, Kaitlyn Fisher.

She looked about twenty years old, dressed fashionably, and affectionately called Kelvin grandpa.

"Grandpa, when Stanley Harrison comes back this time, don't send him on such long trips again."

Kelvin, helpless, said, "Kaitlyn, in our line of work, we have to travel all over the country. Stanley can handle things on his own now; we can't limit his career development, can we?"

"Then don't be so strict with me," Kaitlyn pouted and acted spoiled.

Kelvin patted her hand.

"We'll talk about this later. You go to the office and wait for me; I have something to say to the students."

"Okay." Kaitlyn tilted her head and greeted everyone.

When she saw Christina, she gave her a once-over, a strange look flashing in her eyes.

After his granddaughter left, Kelvin's face turned stern.

"It's quite lively when I'm not around."

Everyone fell silent.

It seemed that in front of Kelvin, they didn't dare to openly exclude anyone.

Kelvin sighed and quickly walked in, looking at Christina. "They didn't give you a hard time, did they?"

Christina shook her head. "No, Mr. Fisher."

Seeing that she didn't mention what had just happened, Kelvin sighed again.

"Since I brought you into the architecture institute, I'll be responsible for you. Learn more and observe more recently."

"I understand!" Christina nodded.

"You all, teach the newcomer more," Kelvin said sternly.

No one said a word.

One bold person complained.

"Everyone's busy now; who wants to deal with someone causing trouble?"

"Who said causing trouble?" Kelvin's sharp gaze swept over.

The person, emboldened, said, "Isn't it? She couldn't even secure a collaboration!"

Kelvin squinted his eyes. "The collaboration isn't urgent."

"Isn't that favoritism?"

Someone muttered.

At that moment, an assistant hurried in.

"We just received a call from Gerald Campbell, the CEO of the construction company. He said there's a new commercial area in the new district that we can design."

Kelvin glanced around.

"Bruce Rivera, you go!"

It was the same person who had just criticized Christina.

Bruce immediately stood up and made a solemn promise.

"Don't worry, Mr. Fisher, I'll definitely secure the deal."

Kelvin remained expressionless.

Bruce didn't mind; as long as he could secure the collaboration, Kelvin would surely value him.

He had already walked out when the assistant looked troubled.

"Mr. Campbell specified someone."

He was sweating, not finishing his sentence, making Bruce lose face.

It's over!

"Who is it?" Kelvin turned to ask.

The assistant's gaze fixed on Christina. "It's Ms. Windsor."

"Me?" Christina was also surprised. "Why? I'm just a newcomer with little experience."

The assistant cleared his throat. "I asked Mr. Campbell about this. I wanted to find someone more experienced, but Mr. Campbell said he really liked your work in the competition. It was bold and innovative."

Christina touched her hair, looking a bit shy. "I have to thank Mr. Campbell for liking it."

"The person in charge over there is trying to reach out. You should go over and have a preliminary discussion. The new commercial area's development will probably start in a month, so there's no rush," the assistant smiled.

"Okay!" Christina nodded and looked at Kelvin.

Kelvin nodded.

"Since Mr. Campbell requested it, you should give it a try."

"Thank you, Mr. Fisher." Christina breathed a sigh of relief.

Meanwhile, Bruce's face was a mix of jealousy, anger, and embarrassment, making him look somewhat ridiculous.

Kelvin originally wanted to go with Christina to take a look, but seeing their expressions, he changed his mind.

"The client chose her. Instead of wasting time on these trivial matters, you should improve your design skills. You all had great design sense initially; don't waste your energy on these petty issues."

Even if they were dissatisfied, they had nothing to say.

Because someone sought collaboration based on her design, Christina had established herself under Kelvin's mentorship.

As they were leaving, a man approached and greeted them.

"Mr. Fisher."

Seeing him, Kelvin's expression softened, and he introduced him.

"This is my student from two years ago, Stanley."

"Hello!" Christina greeted.

Stanley was tall, wore square-framed glasses, had a gentle demeanor, and looked scholarly, exuding an air of elegance and talent.

Possibly due to his travels, his skin was slightly tanned, but his eyes were bright, and his features were sharp and defined.

"Hello, I've heard about the new junior student. Seeing you today, you are indeed extraordinary," Stanley's gaze lingered on her for a moment.

Christina smiled without saying anything.

Kelvin, smiling, praised, "And she has some skills too. She just joined our architecture institute and immediately secured a project."

"Congratulations," Stanley nodded and smiled.

After exchanging a few pleasantries, Stanley said to Kelvin, "Mr. Fisher, Glenn Foster from the National Academy of Sciences will be here soon."

"What does he want with me?" Kelvin sighed, but it was clear he had a good relationship with Glenn.

After a bit of grumbling, he asked the assistant to prepare coffee in the office.

Christina didn't stay long and went straight to the coffee room to meet someone.

Today, it wasn't Gerald who came but a man in charge of the project, named James Lawson.

After exchanging business cards, Christina invited him to sit down, poured a cup of coffee, and said seriously.

"I didn't expect my design to catch your CEO's eye. I'm truly honored, but I still lack experience. Can your CEO really trust me with designing a large commercial area?"

James laughed. "With Mr. Fisher overseeing, do you think you could design a post-apocalyptic wasteland?"

"Of course not. I just feel like no one would choose to hire a complete newcomer," Christina smiled, expressing her concern.

###chapter 45 Subsequent conditions can be discussed slowly

"Our boss naturally has his own considerations." James took a sip of coffee, his deep eyes obscured by the steam, revealing no emotion.

Christina nodded knowingly and didn't delve further into the matter. Instead, she took out a pen and paper and asked seriously.

"Alright, what kind of design style does your company want?"

James pondered for a moment before speaking slowly.

"We want a commercial district that has a modern feel but doesn't lose its traditional charm. It should attract customers of different age groups and have enough cultural depth and commercial vitality."

Christina's pen paused slightly, and she showed an awkward but polite smile.

"This concept seems quite vague."

"Yes, our boss just won the bid for this project a few days ago. To be honest, he doesn't have a specific idea yet; he just wants to create a commercial district." James spread his hands, indicating his helplessness.

Christina was stunned for a moment, feeling that something was odd.

"If there's plenty of time, why not take your time to find a designer?"

"It's because you just won the gold award, and people must be flocking to you. If we don't book your schedule in advance, we might not be able to book you later." James candidly explained the reason.

Christina felt a bit embarrassed.

Although she wasn't exactly in high demand, she wasn't completely without clients either.

The concern he mentioned was unlikely to happen in the short term.

"That won't be a problem. If you are sure you want to collaborate with our architectural firm, we can draft a preliminary contract, and I'll keep my schedule open."

"Sure, that's no problem." James laughed, "As long as you agree, we can discuss the subsequent conditions slowly."

Christina was a bit unsure.

Why did she feel that he was more anxious than she was?

But she couldn't figure out the reason.

After hesitating for a moment, she asked, "Alright, before we officially sign the contract, can I meet your boss to discuss the specific ideas?"

"Of course." James agreed without hesitation, "I'm just here to check your availability. It's good that you have time."

Christina stood up and poured him a cup of coffee.

"Here's your coffee."

Stanley had just arrived at the office when Bruce came over. "Mr. Fisher used to favor you the most, but it seems like that might change now, with the newcomer stealing the spotlight."

Stanley didn't say anything. He just tidied up the blueprints on his desk and locked them in the drawer.

Bruce felt awkward and was about to leave, but he still leaned in. "Hey, aren't you going to do something about it? Letting someone like Christina mix in with us!"

"What's wrong with us? Are we so noble?" Stanley frowned and retorted.

Bruce was taken aback.

Stanley glanced at him and said calmly, "No wonder Mr. Fisher said what he did. You don't focus on your designs and instead think about these irrelevant things. Is it worth it?"

"Fuck! Stop pretending to be so high and mighty." Bruce got angry and slammed the table. "Everyone knows you suck up to Mr. Fisher's granddaughter, and now you're pretending to be all noble. We're being nice because you're one of us!"

Stanley's actions paused slightly.

Bruce got more agitated. "Look at you. Mr. Fisher used to give you all the dirty and tiring jobs, and now she comes in and gets to design a commercial district right away. Do you think you'll ever make it into the mainstream design industry?"

Stanley looked up at him. "We're all doing the work of architects. There's no high or low."

"You can fool us with that, but don't fool yourself." Bruce sneered. "You've been close to Mr. Fisher all this time and haven't gained any benefits. I really feel sorry for you."

Just then, Kaitlyn appeared out of nowhere, glaring.

"What are you doing, Bruce?"

Bruce's expression changed instantly, showing a bit of a fawning smile. "I'm just having a chat with Stanley."

Kaitlyn put her hands on her hips. "Hmph, no one can bully him."

"We're not bullying him." Bruce glanced at Stanley. "Right?"

Stanley couldn't be bothered to respond. He packed up the materials in the drawer and quickly left the room.

Seeing him ignore her, Kaitlyn stomped her foot in anger and was about to chase after him.

Bruce quickly called her back.

"Hey, haven't you noticed that he's never lost his temper or shown any emotion all these years? Don't you want to know why?"

"Ugh, I don't care about your petty issues." Kaitlyn snorted and turned to leave.

Bruce cleared his throat and said loudly, "It's all because of that new girl, Christina. We were talking about Christina, not him, but he got upset and started mocking us."

Kaitlyn stopped in her tracks.

The new girl, Christina. When she brought her grandfather in earlier, Christina was standing right there.

Christina had long hair and was very attractive, standing out among a group of men.

To be honest, she had never seen Stanley stand up for a girl before.

She snorted and left angrily.

Stanley delivered the materials.

Glenn had just arrived and greeted him warmly. "Come on, don't leave. Have a seat."

As he spoke, he looked at Stanley like a big bad wolf eyeing a little rabbit.

Stanley felt a chill down his spine.

"Hello!"

Kelvin took a sip of his coffee.

"What brings you here?"

"This is a bit difficult to say." Glenn sighed.

Kelvin could see through him. If it were really that difficult, he wouldn't have said it. Why put on an act in front of him?

He didn't expose him, nor did he follow Glenn's lead. He just sipped his coffee.

The air was filled with an awkward silence. Sure enough, Glenn couldn't sit still and cleared his throat. "I'm here to ask if I can borrow a few people."

"Borrow people from me?" Kelvin put down his coffee cup. "You have so many people under you. Why borrow my students?"

"I'm in a tough spot." Glenn sighed. "A few days ago, it was reported that a small place in the countryside had discovered medieval buildings in ruins. They said it had restoration value, so they brought a team to restore it to its original appearance."

Kelvin took a deep breath and frowned.

"I remember you have Manuel Jenkins under you. He can lead a team himself now, and he's good at this. Why borrow people from me?"

"Exactly." Glenn spread his hands, looking helpless.

"But the problem is, he broke his leg while restoring the ancient buildings. Now, the cultural relics institute doesn't have any architectural talent and doesn't dare to start work. They called me to find a solution. My students are abroad, and the others are busy. I really can't spare anyone."

Kelvin thought for a moment. "Indeed, we should strongly support the restoration and protection of ancient cultural relics and buildings."

###chapter 46 Deep Hostility Towards Her

Glenn's eyes lit up.

"You agreed?"

"I didn't agree!" Kelvin didn't dare to be too absolute: "I have to ask who is willing to go? If someone is willing, I'll lend them to you."

Glenn's eyes dimmed.

Stanley, who was standing nearby, wanted to say something but thought better of it.

When Kelvin and Glenn came out of the office, they happened to run into Christina, who had just seen someone off.

Christina immediately recognized Glenn and greeted him.

Glenn smiled and praised, "This is the new student you recruited? Looks really good, and you recruit people so quickly."

"You're getting old and still so improper." Kelvin glared at him.

Glenn immediately raised his hand in apology: "Yes, yes, I shouldn't embarrass you in front of your student."

After entering the office, Kelvin began to inquire.

"Glenn has a job from above to restore ancient buildings and lead his team as consultants. Is anyone willing to take it?"

At first, everyone was excited to hear there was a job, but when they heard it was to restore ancient buildings as consultants, no one spoke up.

To avoid leaving Kelvin hanging, someone stood up and said, "We don't have any relevant experience in that area."

"Not much experience is needed." Glenn didn't notice everyone's reluctance and immediately said, "There are professional archaeologists for artifact protection. You just need to provide relevant opinions on the building's load-bearing aspects."

"Doesn't that mean we have to watch over it day and night?"

Glenn nodded: "Yes, it's a bit tough, but it's very fulfilling to contribute to the protection of ancient buildings for the country."

Everyone shook their heads and started making excuses.

"I just started a new case, so I can't leave."

"Me too. I have some free time these days to watch over it, but soon I have to go on a business trip. I can't make the whole team wait for me."

Kelvin knew this would happen and turned his gaze to Bruce.

"What about you?"

"Me?" Bruce's eyes darted around: "I haven't taken a vacation in a long time. I planned to go home and see my mom. She's getting old, and I can't go back on my word and make her sad."

Kelvin sighed.

This group of people with high expectations but low abilities just didn't want to do it because the pay was low.

The national ancient building protection project wouldn't pay much, only a few thousand dollars per project, which couldn't compare to the jobs they took outside.

Although those jobs weren't easy either, the treatment and effort were worlds apart from protecting ancient buildings.

Kelvin didn't really want to agree to lend people, but after agreeing, he couldn't find anyone, which made him a bit embarrassed.

At this moment, two people suddenly spoke in unison.

"I'll go."

Hearing the same voice, Christina looked at Stanley in surprise, not expecting they had the same thought.

Kelvin looked at them.

"Stanley, you just got back from a business trip. That place is very remote, and it might take a long time. You haven't had a good rest yet."

Stanley shook his head: "Mr. Fisher, I just entered this industry not long ago and hope to gain more experience."

"Don't you have a partner looking for you? Why do you want to go? This job is tough." Kelvin looked at Christina, unable to make up his mind.

These two were young under his tutelage. It wasn't that he doubted their abilities, but he was afraid new faces wouldn't be convincing.

"Looks like Senior and I had the same thought." Christina smiled gracefully and said, "We both want to gain more experience."

"The more, the better." Glenn, afraid Kelvin would disagree, finalized the matter: "Young people with a desire to train should be given the chance."

There was no turning back now.

Both had agreed, and Glenn wasn't picky, so Kelvin agreed, deliberately putting on a stern face.

"Alright, you better not mistreat my two students."

Glenn, having settled the matter, was naturally grateful.

"Don't worry, once this is done, I'll treat everyone to a meal as thanks."

Kelvin asked, "When do they leave?"

"Tomorrow. They can't wait over there, so please accommodate." Glenn knew Kelvin was reluctant and spoke nicely.

Kelvin nodded and couldn't help but remind them, "The countryside is very remote. Take more things with you, don't suffer, and make sure to rest and not overwork."

Unexpectedly, Kelvin, a titan in the architecture world, was so considerate.

Christina nodded and said seriously, "Don't worry, Mr. Fisher."

They saw them off.

Glenn and Kelvin seemed to have something to discuss, so the two didn't follow them out.

Christina felt the situation was a bit dry without saying something, so she smiled and said, "Senior, I have no experience, so please guide me in the future."

"Just help each other." Stanley withdrew his gaze and smiled faintly.

"Calling him 'Senior' so affectionately." Kaitlyn stood at the corner of the hallway, arms crossed, looking at them with jealousy.

When the two looked at her, she snorted and walked over quickly, sizing up Christina.

"You don't look like someone who works in architecture."

"Really? But you can't judge a person by their appearance." Christina smiled faintly.

She could tell that Kelvin's granddaughter was very hostile towards her.

Kaitlyn sneered, "You're so pretty, why do such hard work?"

Besides, Kelvin hadn't taken any students in the past two years. Most architects were over thirty, and there were very few women. A woman appearing among a group of men would certainly cause a stir.

Moreover, Christina was quite attractive.

Kaitlyn looked her up and down again, feeling a strong sense of crisis.

Christina answered sincerely, "I do this because I like it, not for any other reason. What do you like?"

Kaitlyn raised her chin and said without hesitation, "Eating, drinking, and having fun."

Hearing this answer, Christina was genuinely stunned for a moment but still patiently smiled and replied, "Just like your eating, drinking, and having fun, I like this industry, so I do it."

Kaitlyn hadn't thought much of it before, but now, comparing these two dreams, she suddenly felt like she had no ambition or goals.

She didn't want to continue this topic and directly took Stanley's hand.

"Stanley, will you go shopping with me? You've been away on a business trip for so long, and we haven't seen each other in ages. After shopping, I'll treat you to a meal."

Stanley calmly removed her hand and said indifferently, "I have things to do, so I can't go with you. You go by yourself."

###chapter 47: Why Don't You Take Care of Me?

As soon as Kaitlyn heard this, her fiery temper flared up again.

"Did my grandpa give you another task? You just got back, can't you rest for a few days?"

Seeing Stanley not speaking, Kaitlyn turned her head, "I'll go talk to him."

"It has nothing to do with Mr. Fisher, it's my own decision to go," Stanley said helplessly. "Don't go talk to him, I really want more opportunities."

Kaitlyn turned back, pouting, with a somewhat aggrieved expression on her face.

"Am I getting in your way?"

"No," Stanley said patiently. Despite Kaitlyn's pestering, he didn't lose his temper, just smiled gently.

Christina knew they had more to say to each other and was about to leave.

But Stanley suddenly called out to her.

"Hey, I need to discuss something with you about the building restoration."

Christina was taken aback, "Okay."

"Let's go!" Stanley walked ahead.

Christina immediately followed.

Kaitlyn wanted to call him but couldn't, a look of resentment flashed across her face.

"You two, you two!"

Just then, Kelvin came in and saw her stomping her feet in anger. He asked with a smile, "Who made my precious Kaitlyn so angry?"

"It's that Stanley!" Kaitlyn said unwillingly, glancing in the direction they left, fuming. "He dared to ignore me, I won't let him get away with it."

Kelvin shook his head helplessly.

"He's busy, unlike you, who have nothing to do all day."

"If you don't give him work, he wouldn't be busy, right?" Kaitlyn pouted, resting her head on her hand, and then smiled as if she had thought of something. "If he's not busy, he can spend more time with me and we can go to the amusement park."

Kelvin, with his hands behind his back, said, "I originally planned to give him a few days off, but Glenn urgently needs talent for a business trip. Out of all my students, only he and Christina were willing to go."

The more he spoke, the more he felt sad.

His students were always thinking about fame and fortune.

Contributing to the country by restoring old buildings? No one was eager to step forward.

The more he thought about it, the sadder he became. "Fortunately, the two of them stepped up. Otherwise, if everyone kept making excuses, I would have been embarrassed in front of Glenn."

Kaitlyn suddenly caught the key point sharply, "The two of them on a business trip? That's not okay! You need to call one of them back."

"That's not possible, everything is already decided," Kelvin said, deliberately putting on a stern face. "You can be willful about other things, but this kind of thing can't be decided based on your preferences."

Kaitlyn opened her mouth but couldn't say a word.

Letting the two of them go together? She still couldn't feel at ease. They had just met and already seemed to admire each other.

If they stayed together in some remote place, wouldn't they come back with a child?

"No, no!" Kaitlyn was scared by her own imagination.

She absolutely couldn't let this happen!

The next day, when Christina arrived at the meeting point, she saw a bus parked in front of her.

Although Glenn was quite famous in the industry, he was very amiable.

"The conditions are limited, and we need to carry equipment, so you'll have to make do with the bus."

"It doesn't matter, any vehicle is fine as long as we reach the destination," Christina said, not minding.

Glenn called someone to put her luggage in the bus's luggage compartment.

As she was about to get on, Stanley arrived and greeted her.

"You're here early."

Christina nodded and got on first, finding a seat.

The bus windows were very clear, and there would probably be a lot of beautiful scenery along the way. She decided to make the best of it.

As she was looking out the window, Stanley suddenly sat next to her.

There were other empty seats, but since she didn't know anyone else on this trip, it was nice to sit with someone familiar.

Almost everyone had arrived, and the bus was about to depart when a car stopped in front of it.

The bus driver quickly hit the brakes and stuck his head out, "What are you doing? Do you have a death wish?"

As he spoke, a beautifully dressed girl got out of the car and waved her hand, "Move my stuff onto the bus, be careful not to damage anything."

Hearing the commotion, Christina looked up and saw it was Kaitlyn. She was dressed beautifully in a country-style floral dress, wearing a straw hat, looking like she was going on a picnic, and wearing 4-inch high-heeled sandals, looking like a pretty little princess.

After getting on, Kaitlyn's eyes searched around, and when she saw Stanley next to Christina, her face immediately lit up with a sweet smile.

"Hi, Stanley, I know my grandpa likes to use his people to the fullest. Who knows when he'll give you a break, so I decided to join you on this trip and treat it as a vacation!"

Kaitlyn was initially very happy, but when she saw Christina, her smile froze.

Although she knew they would be on this trip together, seeing them sitting so close on the nearly empty bus made her uncomfortable.

But she didn't rush to pull Stanley away. Instead, she sat parallel to them, staring at them without saying a word.

After a while, the bus left the city, and the road became rough and bumpy.

Kaitlyn dry-heaved a few times and looked at Stanley with teary eyes, "I feel so sick, I'm getting carsick."

"We still have over an hour to go, and the road will get worse. If you can't handle it, you can go back now," Stanley said calmly. "Besides, we're here to work, not to play."

Kaitlyn pouted but had no choice.

She couldn't just rush over and separate them like a shrew, that would be too embarrassing!

Christina usually didn't get carsick, but the bumpy mountain road made her face pale, and she felt nauseous, almost about to throw up.

Stanley took out a thermos from his bag, "It's insulated, the water should be at a good temperature now. Drinking some warm water will help. I also have some plums."

"Thanks," Christina wanted to refuse, but as soon as she opened her mouth, the nausea surged up, so she accepted Stanley's kindness.

"Why aren't you taking care of me?" Kaitlyn whined, but her face was already pale.

Christina thought for a moment and decided to pass Stanley's kindness to Kaitlyn.

Before she could hand it over, Stanley stopped her.

###chapter 48: Harm Others, Harm Yourself

"Don't mind Kaitlyn."

However, Christina noticed that Kaitlyn was genuinely uncomfortable, not pretending.

Stanley's sharp eyebrows slightly furrowed as he coldly said, "These things have nothing to do with her, yet she insists on coming along. Let her suffer a bit, so she'll remember and won't come so easily next time."

Christina was indifferent.

"Kelvin used to bring her along, and we always took care of her," Stanley shook his head, sighed, and lowered his voice, "She won't last long. Let her go back, and our work will be faster."

That might be for the best.

Christina didn't insist anymore. The sour and sweet plums were delicious, and the nauseous feeling was indeed suppressed a lot.

After finishing, she glanced at Stanley, "Don't you get carsick? Why aren't you eating?"

"I travel a lot for work, so I don't get carsick. I'm used to this kind of environment," Stanley said calmly.

Since it wasn't for himself, could it be for someone else?

Christina suddenly realized that she might be the one he specifically brought the plums for, and she felt a bit awkward.

"Senior, I didn't expect you to take such good care of your junior."

Stanley remained indifferent, "It's my duty."

Christina didn't mind, "Thanks."

An hour later, they arrived at their destination.

Originally, she thought it would be some particularly tough countryside, but the small town was quite prosperous, with everything available.

Kaitlyn got out of the car and almost threw up, taking a long time to recover.

She leaned against the car, seeing the current situation, and sighed in relief, "At least it's not some poor and remote place. Although it's a bit lacking, it has everything."

The person in charge called everyone down and said, "We haven't arrived yet. It's already noon, so let's rest for a while. We can go this afternoon or tomorrow morning. I need to contact the other side first and arrange accommodations."

"Do we still have to go? How long will it take?" Kaitlyn felt very uncomfortable.

"One or two hours," the person in charge wasn't very sure. He warmly invited everyone, "Come, come, let's eat first. Don't worry about these things. How can we let you help us without eating well? There are many local specialties here."

The group entered a restaurant.

The signboard listed several local specialties.

Local chicken, wild vegetables from the mountains, a dazzling array of dishes.

The person in charge arranged a big meal.

Christina got off the car and took a few breaths of the mountain air, feeling much better. She was indeed a bit hungry.

As she sat down, a familiar voice suddenly came. How many years?

"Mr. Cavendish, developing this area into a resort would be great."

William walked in with a frown.

"The roads are still inconvenient."

"No problem, we can slowly improve them," Jennifer said with a bright smile, "If I handle the planning, I'm confident I can make this resort the most popular high-end resort in the country."

She stopped mid-sentence.

Her gaze fell on Christina sitting at the table.

Now, the two were like enemies meeting, their eyes blazing with anger.

But with William present, Jennifer wouldn't go too far.

William's gaze also fell on Christina.

At that moment, Stanley served her a bowl of soup and said considerately, "The chicken from the countryside is fresh and nourishing."

"Thank you!"

Christina accepted it.

Stanley's gaze shifted upward, and he suddenly said, "Don't move."

Christina's body stiffened, "What's wrong?"

Stanley reached out with his distinct fingers and gently removed a willow catkin from her hair, "There are many willow catkins in the mountains, and you got one on you."

"I see, it's harmless," Christina waved her hand indifferently.

Unexpectedly, this action made both of their eyes narrow.

Kaitlyn gritted her teeth, watching them.

Jennifer was stunned for a moment, then suddenly laughed, "It seems Christina is doing well recently, even having a romantic interest."

William's deep gaze narrowed.

"Let's go."

"Aren't you going to say hello?" Jennifer deliberately instigated.

William said nothing and went straight upstairs.

Christina quietly sighed in relief.

At that moment, Kaitlyn suddenly screamed, "Ah! Snake!"

Thinking there was a snake on the ground, Christina was almost scared out of her wits.

But it turned out to be a dish brought by the waiter.

The waiter explained with a smile, "This is our local specialty snake soup, extremely delicious. Many local farmers raise snakes, all freshly killed."

Kaitlyn looked disgusted, "Ew, I won't eat it! Take it away!"

The person in charge, who had finalized the menu, looked a bit embarrassed. Since they were here, he naturally chose some local specialties.

Stanley directly took a piece and nodded repeatedly, "It tastes good."

The person in charge quietly sighed in relief, "Everyone, enjoy your meal. After eating, you can explore the area."

Everyone was indeed interested.

Christina was the first to go out. She had to admit, this place was truly picturesque. A few miles south, there was a small forest, and at the end of the forest was a reed marsh.

In the distance, the lake and mountains met.

At that moment, a voice came from a few meters behind her.

"Hey, look up!"

Christina looked up and saw a small wasp nest above her head.

Kaitlyn showed a malicious smile, "You're doomed."

She then used a long stick to knock down the wasp nest.

Christina was both angry and scared, "Are you out of your mind?"

But she couldn't care less and had to run for her life.

At that moment, a pair of large hands suddenly grabbed her. She looked up and saw that it was William.

"Why are you here?" she asked in surprise.

Could he have followed her out?

William narrowed his cold eyes, "Now's not the time to talk. Let's go!"

He led her to a muddy area with abundant water plants. Although there were many mosquitoes, the mud and water in the swamp were effective in preventing wasp stings.

Covered in mud, they hid behind the reeds.

The mud seemed to work, as the wasps didn't track them and instead turned to attack Kaitlyn.

Although Kaitlyn was spoiled, she wasn't stupid. She quickly realized why the wasps weren't chasing them.

She bit her lip and, not caring about the dirt, dove into the mud, even moving forward a few steps to avoid the wasps.

After a while, the wasps left.

Christina looked at Kaitlyn, who was not far behind her, and coldly said, "Those who harm others end up harming themselves."

She then slowly moved out of the mud and cleaned herself by the shore.

###chapter 49: What are you doing here?

"Why are you here?" William looked at Christina with a probing gaze.

"I should be asking you that," Christina replied with a forced smile.

It was clear that they couldn't agree on this issue, so they decided to drop it.

William gave her a cold glance. "Don't cause trouble."

Christina didn't respond. What did he mean by 'don't cause trouble'? When had she ever caused trouble?

But she couldn't be bothered to argue.

William, seemingly unable to stand the mud on him and seeing that she was out of danger, left directly.

Christina watched his back.

"Ridiculous."

She was about to leave when she heard Kaitlyn struggling.

Turning around, she saw that the mud pit was extremely unstable, and Kaitlyn was stuck up to her thighs, struggling to get out.

After thinking for a moment, Christina picked up the long stick Kaitlyn had used to poke the wasp nest and extended it from the shore.

Kaitlyn was stunned when she saw the stick.

This was the stick she had used to poke the wasp nest to harm Christina, and now Christina was using it to save her!

She hesitated for a moment, not immediately reaching out.

Christina didn't expect Kaitlyn to be so stubborn and proud. She laughed and said, "There might be leeches in this mud pit. If you don't get out soon, they'll suck you dry."

Kaitlyn shuddered and quickly grabbed the stick.

With the support, she climbed out effortlessly.

By the time she got out, she was panting heavily. She glanced at Christina beside her.

"Why did you help me?"

"Did you expect me to watch you drown here?" Christina retorted.

"But I just..." Kaitlyn trailed off.

Seeing her guilty expression, Christina asked deliberately, "Do you realize you were wrong? How old are you, still playing childish pranks!"

"I wasn't playing a prank. Who told you to get so close to my Stanley?" Kaitlyn lifted her chin.

Christina shook her head speechlessly. "I just met him today as a colleague. You don't have to see me as an enemy. That's not how you like someone."

"Do you have a lot of experience?" Kaitlyn asked eagerly.

Experience? Not really, but she could probably fool Kaitlyn.

After thinking for a moment, Christina said, "I don't know much about him, but he probably loves architecture. He takes on all kinds of dirty and tiring work. If you like someone, you should support what they love."

"But I don't like it," Kaitlyn sighed, hugging her knees sadly. "He's always running off, and Grandpa won't tell me where he goes."

"Then try to keep up with him and don't cause trouble," Christina said, standing up and extending her hand. "Otherwise, you'll just push him further away."

"Really?" Kaitlyn looked at her with wide eyes.

"Really!" Christina nodded firmly.

Kaitlyn seemed to take it in, looking thoughtful. Suddenly, she asked, "You won't blame me, will you?"

"No, everyone makes mistakes," Christina said, seeing that Kaitlyn was genuinely remorseful. It wasn't a big deal, and being too serious about it wouldn't help. Kaitlyn just used the wrong method to express her feelings.

Kaitlyn propped her chin and sighed.

Christina stood up and dusted herself off. "Alright, let's go back. You're all wet. Be careful not to catch a cold."

Kaitlyn quickly got up. "Wait for me."

The tension between them had been palpable to the whole group, but now Kaitlyn was sticking close to Christina.

"Christina," Kaitlyn said, having changed into a new outfit. "Do you think this looks good for the scenery?"

Christina nodded. "It looks good."

"It's too conspicuous. It won't look good in the sunlight," came a voice from behind. It was Jennifer.

"Who are you?" Kaitlyn asked rudely.

Jennifer's gaze shifted between the two of them before she smiled faintly. "I guess I'm a friend of Christina's. Right, Christina?"

"I don't remember having a friend like you," Christina said bluntly.

After all, they would part ways soon.

Jennifer's eyebrow twitched, and she looked displeased.

But the more you want something, the harder it is to get it.

Just then, the person in charge came over, smiling. "Everyone rested? Let's head out. These people are going the same way, so you can keep each other company."

The people he referred to seemed to include William.

It seemed the more you wanted to avoid someone, the more likely you were to run into them.

But Christina didn't ask much. Along the way, Kaitlyn chattered like a bird.

Now that they were sitting together, Stanley looked quite surprised.

An hour later, they reached their destination. It was indeed desolate. If not for the ancient buildings waiting to be restored, it would have felt like entering a no-man's land.

The person in charge was about to take them to their rooms when Kaitlyn suddenly looked unwell and collapsed.

Christina, standing next to her, quickly caught her, preventing her from hitting the ground face-first.

Everyone panicked, but the person in charge remained calm.

"Call the medic."

The medic arrived quickly and did a simple check but couldn't find the cause.

"What's going on? It's not low blood sugar."

Even pressing the acupressure point didn't work; there was no response.

"Take her to her room and let the doctor take care of her," the person in charge said.

A whole day passed, and Kaitlyn still hadn't woken up.

Jennifer, aware of the situation and Kaitlyn's identity, hatched a plan.

"Is she still unconscious?" she asked one of the team members.

"Yes," the team member nodded.

Jennifer lowered her voice. "I saw that girl accidentally poke a wasp nest the other day, almost getting Christina stung. I can't believe they're so close now."

The team member was puzzled. "I know, right? Kaitlyn was so sarcastic to Christina the whole way. How did they become friends so quickly? It's really strange."

Jennifer squinted. "I know Christina well. She's sneaky. She might act indifferent, but who knows what she did to make Kaitlyn unconscious."

The team member suddenly understood. "That makes sense."

###chapter 50: What are you doing here?

Everyone here had nothing to do, and it was a small circle, so rumors spread quickly and almost became true.

"Kaitlyn is so pitiful, her parents are not around, and she has always been with Mr. Fisher. I didn't expect Mr. Fisher's student to harm her."

"That's right."

Stanley heard these rumors, frowned, and stopped them, "What nonsense are you talking about?"

"Kaitlyn hasn't woken up since she fainted yesterday. What kind of illness can cause such a coma?" The team member spoke as if it were true, "Everyone is saying so!"

"Spreading rumors comes with responsibility!" Stanley frowned and said coldly.

As they spoke, a special vehicle arrived.

The person in charge quickly greeted the medical staff from the car.

"She's in the second room upstairs."

The medical staff carried a stretcher upstairs and quickly brought Kaitlyn down and placed her in the car.

Immediately after, Christina also came down and got into the car.

Seeing this, Stanley quickly stepped forward to ask, "What's going on?"

The person in charge saw him and briefly explained the situation, "Our medical conditions here are really limited, and Kaitlyn hasn't woken up. Mr. Fisher is particularly worried, so he sent a medical vehicle to take Miss Fisher to the hospital for treatment."

Christina was also vaguely worried, and she had heard the rumors outside in the past two days.

She just felt that the incident happened suddenly and didn't know where to start solving it. Now that Kaitlyn was being transferred for treatment, she naturally had to go back and see the situation.

"Senior, I'm really sorry. I originally said I would solve this matter with you, but now I can only go back first. You'll have to take care of things here."

She said apologetically.

Stanley didn't take this matter to heart. If it weren't for the imminent building restoration here, he would also want to go back and see.

"Okay, after you go back, if Kaitlyn wakes up, remember to let me know she's safe."

"Don't worry, senior." Christina said, closing the door.

Jennifer watched the car and picked up her phone to make a call.

"Is the press release ready? Send it out immediately. I want her to face a disaster when she gets back."

Jennifer looked at her newly done nails, a smug smile on her lips.

William came out of his place.

He had basically packed everything and put it in the car. Jennifer quickly followed, "Didn't you say you were going to investigate here for a few days? Why are you in such a hurry to go back?"

"I have something to take care of." William said coldly.

Jennifer was stunned for a moment, feeling uneasy.

"Okay, I'll go back with you."

She always felt that it was because Christina had already gone back that William was in such a hurry to return, but she had no evidence, just a vague guess.

After returning, Kaitlyn was arranged to receive treatment in the hospital.

Although the medical conditions were good, it wasn't easy to find out the cause of her coma.

Rumors were everywhere outside, and Kelvin heard some public opinion on the way and became even more anxious!

He came to the hospital, saw his granddaughter, and quickly asked the doctor.

"What happened to my granddaughter?"

The doctor looked at the examination report and sighed, "For now, all her physical indicators are normal. It shouldn't be a pathological cause."

"Then what is the cause?" Kelvin became more anxious. If they couldn't find the cause, it would be difficult to treat.

The doctor couldn't guarantee anything and hesitated, "We plan to observe for a few days."

"Could it be man-made?" Kelvin thought of the rumors in the press release and anxiously asked.

The doctor pondered for a moment, wanting to shake his head in denial but also thinking that this cause could be man-made.

He sighed, "After we investigate and understand, we'll give you a definite answer, okay?"

Kelvin's legs felt weak, and he was filled with regret. He had always kept an eye on Kaitlyn, not letting her run around outside. This time, he didn't watch her, and she had only been out for two or three days before falling into a coma.

He only had one granddaughter. What should he do now!

After Christina finished the hospitalization procedures, she saw Kelvin and immediately greeted him, "Mr. Fisher!"

Thinking of the online rumors that Kaitlyn's coma was related to her, Kelvin felt uneasy.

"What are you doing here?"

His voice carried a hint of suspicion.

Christina could hear the doubt in his tone and had to speak honestly, "There are many rumors about me online. I thought I should come back and see."

Kelvin was extremely troubled and couldn't judge the situation. After thinking for a moment, he waved his hand.

"You don't need to take care of things here. Go back and rest."

Christina wanted to explain but didn't know where to start.

"Mr. Fisher, if you need anything, just call me."

She also wanted to know why Kaitlyn was in a coma.

But she had a rough idea of who was behind the online rumors. She just hated that she didn't have medical skills to find out the cause of Kaitlyn's coma and clear her name.

Online, it was almost one-sided!

Because she had recently won the gold medal in an architecture competition, she had some fame and was widely discussed.

Several people claiming to be insiders posted.

"I work at the architecture institute where Mr. Fisher is. Let me tell you, these two have been at odds since their first meeting. This time, they happened to be on a business trip to the same place. Christina must have taken the opportunity to retaliate. It's obvious."

"How can Christina be so vicious? She was highly regarded in the design competition, and Mr. Fisher supported her, giving her a chance to learn by his side. I didn't expect her to be so ruthless, taking the opportunity to harm Mr. Fisher's granddaughter during the business trip."

"She's simply inhuman!"

Christina looked at these so-called insider posts and couldn't figure out who posted them!

And some online speculations seemed so real, as if they had witnessed everything firsthand.

"Before this project started, the two were at odds. Somehow, they got closer. Christina must have done it on purpose to retaliate."

"Seeing her on TV, she doesn't seem like a good person. Poor Kaitlyn, an innocent socialite, was led into a trap by Christina step by step."

Sometimes Christina really wanted to report them for defamation.

But unexpectedly, a netizen said, "I've already reported it to the police. They might open a case. Just wait, I'll bring Christina, this bad woman, to justice."

Christina was shocked and didn't know if the other person was telling the truth.

###chapter 51: Just Say It

But unexpectedly, the other party wasn't lying.

In the afternoon, the police came directly to the door. After showing their IDs, they asked Christina, "Are you Christina?"

Christina was stunned for a moment, "Yes, that's me!"

Elisa heard voices at the door and poked her head out, "Christina, who is it?"

"Nothing." Christina didn't want to tell her, to avoid worrying her.

Unexpectedly, Elisa walked out directly and saw the police officers in uniform, her face turned a bit ugly, "What do you want with my daughter?"

The police officer said seriously, "It's about Kaitlyn's case. We have some questions for your daughter."

"How can you believe those rumors online? They are not insiders. Who called the police? They are harming my daughter." Elisa had obviously seen some bad comments online, so she knew a bit and came out to defend her.

Christina didn't want her to get involved in these matters.

She patted Elisa's hand, "Mom, don't worry, the innocent will be proven innocent."

The police officer said expressionlessly, "If you have time, please come with us to the station to cooperate with the investigation."

"What do you mean? Are you arresting her? No way." Elisa was like a mother hen protecting her chick.

Christina gently tugged on Elisa's sleeve, signaling her to calm down. She knew that getting agitated at this time would only make things worse.

"Mom, it's okay. Cooperating with the investigation is a normal procedure. I will go with them to prove my innocence." Christina's tone was calm, but there was a hint of determination in her eyes.

Elisa wanted to say something more, but in the end, she just nodded, looking worriedly at her daughter, "Be careful, don't let anyone bully you."

Christina smiled and nodded, comforting her mother with a few words, then turned and followed the police.

At the police station, Christina was placed in a small room for questioning.

The police's questions were very detailed, starting from how she met Kaitlyn to their recent interactions, not missing a single detail.

"Ms. Windsor, when was the last time you saw Kaitlyn?"

"After coming back from the work site, I took her to the hospital." Christina said calmly.

The police asked, "We heard from the architecture department that you had a dispute before."

"It wasn't really a dispute, just a small misunderstanding. We had just met the day before the business trip." Christina answered truthfully.

"What misunderstanding?" The police pressed on.

Christina smiled and answered seriously, "She had someone she liked, and I happened to be close to that person and had to go on a business trip together, so we had a quarrel. The architecture department should have surveillance footage."

Everything was asked clearly from beginning to end.

Christina smiled faintly, "If you suspect I drugged her, you can ask. Kaitlyn wasn't part of the business trip initially. She wanted to go out and joined the car the next day. I was already in the car by then, how could I have prepared those things?"

The police were speechless.

To be honest, accusing her of drugging someone was indeed far-fetched.

But with enthusiastic citizens reporting, they had to investigate.

"Ms. Windsor, please do not leave the city recently and be available for further questioning." The police officer closed the record, looking serious.

"Of course, I have a clear conscience and am not afraid of investigation." Christina laughed.

Her daughter was suspected of murder, and now she was taken to the police station for questioning. Elisa was really worried. After much hesitation, she decided to find Raymond.

"There are some things I shouldn't ask you, but..."

Her hesitant look made Raymond helpless, "What do you want to say? Just say it."

"It's about the recent online rumors, saying my daughter harmed someone. How could my daughter harm anyone?" Elisa walked up to him, placing her hand on his, looking sincere.

"You know my daughter's character best, timid and kind, how could she do such a thing?"

Raymond sighed.

"The public opinion is so strong, it's hard to handle."

Raymond's words made Elisa feel even more disheartened. She knew how terrifying public opinion could be, capable of easily destroying a person's reputation and future.

She looked at Raymond helplessly, tears glistening in her eyes.

Raymond looked at her with pity, gently patting her hand, comforting, "Don't worry, I'll ask William for help. He should have a way."

Elisa nodded, still worried but knowing she could only trust Raymond and Christina now.

William didn't refuse and agreed to help investigate.

Before Kaitlyn returned to the city's hospital for treatment, rumors had already started spreading online.

There was only one possibility, the problem lay with the construction team and their survey team.

He first contacted the head of the construction team to understand the situation at the time. The head naturally wouldn't say anything directly, but under William's questioning, he revealed some information.

He mentioned that before Kaitlyn's incident, some team members were discussing Christina and Kaitlyn, but he didn't know the specifics.

William frowned and hung up the phone.

Jennifer, who was outside the door, heard their conversation and felt scared.

If William found out about this, it would be bad. But she hadn't been involved in the construction team's matters, so it wouldn't be too hard to clear herself.

She immediately called someone, asking them to take the risk of spreading the rumors and offered a high profit.

After hanging up, Jennifer's delicate face showed a hint of nervousness, but she quickly concealed it. She knew that any panic at this time could become a clue for William to trace the truth.

She thought she could fool William, but unexpectedly, William had already found clues before officially starting the investigation.

In just two days, he had traced the source of the rumors clearly.

He called Jennifer.

"Where are you?"

Jennifer suppressed her panic, "I'm at the hospital with my father visiting Kaitlyn."

Her father had been a student under Kelvin, and although he had been independent for many years, he still felt grateful to Kelvin.

Upon hearing about Kaitlyn's incident from the news, he naturally came to visit. Since she was also in the industry, she was brought along by her father.

There was a deathly silence on the other end. Jennifer knew William was investigating and feared being found out, so she quickly said, "Mr. Cavendish, if you need me, I can come over right away."

"No need, I'll come to you." William said and hung up.

Hearing the busy tone on the other end, Jennifer felt anxious, every minute and second felt like a punishment!

###chapter 52: Are You Still Going to Pretend?

Although Kelvin now suspects Christina and seems reluctant to welcome her to the hospital, Christina still feels uneasy.

Moreover, she now has some clues and evidence. Although it is not the best time to clarify, she still wants to make an effort.

She went directly to the hospital and, before entering the ward, suddenly heard voices coming from the fire escape.

She moved closer to listen and recognized the voices immediately; it was William and Jennifer.

"How much were you involved in this?"

William's voice.

Jennifer swallowed nervously and said, "Involved in what? I don't understand."

"Are you still pretending at this point?" William's voice was as cold as ever.

He was like a cold, hard stone, impossible to move or warm.

Jennifer bit her lip.

"I, I just"

She was so scared she could barely speak, her voice trembling as if she was about to cry.

"I just suspected her. You know, Christina is flamboyant and will stop at nothing to achieve her goals. I just wanted to use public opinion to get the police to investigate her."

Jennifer stopped crying and continued, "And I was also afraid of being implicated, so I took preemptive measures. Mr. Cavendish, how did your investigation go? I did spread the rumors, but she must have done it."

William said calmly, "No evidence."

"No evidence doesn't mean she didn't do it. She must be trying to frame me. I was just striking back first." Jennifer wiped her tears fiercely.

Christina finally understood.

William had investigated this matter.

This had nothing to do with him initially, so why did he suddenly investigate? Was he afraid Jennifer would be implicated in this mess?

He really was protective of Jennifer, investigating everything in advance. If there was any hint of trouble that could implicate Jennifer, he could release all the evidence.

But he didn't expect that Jennifer was the one behind it.

Christina really wanted to ask him if Jennifer's image in his mind had shattered.

She pushed the door open and tilted her head with a smile, "The ward is right next door. Whispering here is so boring. Why not clear things up in front of everyone? Kelvin loves his granddaughter very much and would surely want to know what's going on."

Jennifer was startled, "What are you going to do?"

"It's not about what I'm going to do, but someone has to apologize for causing all this trouble." Christina smiled and then shouted.

"Mr. Fisher, I've caught the real culprit."

The ward door was already open, and hearing Christina's voice, Kelvin came out of the ward.

At the same time, Jennifer's father, Arnold Spencer, also came out, looking puzzled.

Christina, knowing the truth, didn't plan to hold back and directly targeted Jennifer.

"You spread those rumors online, didn't you?"

"What nonsense are you talking about?" Jennifer was stunned and instinctively denied it.

Unexpectedly, William frowned upon hearing this, clearly disgusted by her lying and denial.

Christina laughed and pointed to the surveillance camera above them.

"You two were talking here just now, and it should all be recorded. These surveillance cameras have audio recording capabilities. Should we check the footage?"

She paused and continued, "Mr. Cavendish just said he found out you spread the rumors. I'm not making this up, am I?"

Jennifer's face turned pale.

William smiled coldly, "No need to check. It's true."

Seeing that William didn't stand up for her, Jennifer felt a bit panicked.

But she quickly steadied herself, "I did spread the rumors. I've always known you would stop at nothing to achieve your goals. I just wanted the police to investigate the real reason for Miss Fisher's coma."

"Really?" Christina stepped forward.

"Everyone knows that involving the police is the only way to solve problems. You didn't go to the police first but spread rumors. Were you guilty and had no evidence, so you slandered others? You say it was for Miss Fisher's good, but your way of helping is quite unique."

Hearing Christina's sarcastic words, William frowned.

"Enough!"

"Not enough." Christina sneered, relentless, "Since we're already talking, let's clear everything up so there's no confusion later."

She looked at William, her words tinged with sarcasm.

"If Ms. Spencer were the one suffering such injustice, I believe you would investigate thoroughly to ensure she wasn't wronged."

Fine, if they wanted her to swallow this, she would make a big deal out of it.

With Kelvin here, she would clear everything up so there would be no confusion later, and no one could blame her.

William just looked at her, his cold, deep eyes showing no emotion or warmth.

Christina sneered, aggressive and unyielding.

"If I'm not mistaken, the rumors started spreading within the first hour of Kaitlyn's coma and only began to ferment after she arrived at the hospital."

"I said I was just suspicious, and" Jennifer weakly argued, her voice growing fainter, clearly lacking confidence.

Christina didn't wait for her to finish and pressed on.

"At that time, everyone thought Kaitlyn might be sick, which is why she was unconscious. It wasn't until the next day, after she was brought to the hospital for examination, that things seemed off. How did you guess it was intentional right away? Unless you were involved."

"Don't talk nonsense. I wasn't." Jennifer's face turned pale.

She didn't expect the rumors she spread would become a weapon against her.

"If you didn't do it, it's hard for a normal person to think of that right away. Who would be so dark-minded to suspect others unless they did it themselves?"

Christina snorted, "Afraid of being found out, you struck first, spreading rumors that I did it."

"Don't talk nonsense. I didn't!" Jennifer didn't know how to defend herself. Some things were already clear.

"What didn't you do? Didn't spread rumors? Or didn't poison anyone? You did both, yet you deny it. How can anyone believe you?"

Christina cornered Jennifer, relentless, giving her no chance to breathe.

###chapter 53: Won't Let You Down

Jennifer's momentum weakened, which meant she was feeling guilty.

Jennifer took a step back, anxiously explaining, "I really just released the public opinion, I didn't harm Miss Fisher. You have to believe me, I didn't have the chance to harm her."

At this point, everyone understood what was going on.

Kaitlyn might not have been harmed by someone, but the rumors were spread by Jennifer!

Kelvin was somewhat disappointed. Not only did Jennifer spread false information about his student, but she also made it public, making everyone laugh at their architecture department.

"You really disappoint me. I originally thought you were a promising young person with a bright future, but I didn't expect you to do such deceitful things."

He still remembered Jennifer hiring a ghostwriter. Although it was disgraceful, she was young and impetuous. Who hasn't made mistakes when they were young? As long as she corrected them, it would be fine.

Unexpectedly, she did something like this now.

Arnold, hearing his former Mr. Fisher say this, was immediately furious and loudly scolded his daughter.

"Jennifer, what are you doing? Do you know how much harm your actions have caused Miss Fisher? You've made our whole family lose face!"

Arnold's face was livid. He had always been proud of his daughter, but now, he only felt a burning shame.

Jennifer's face turned even paler from her father's words. She understood that today's events had thoroughly angered her father. She helplessly looked at William, hoping he would say something to defend her.

However, William just looked at her coldly, his eyes full of disappointment.

Jennifer knew that her image in his heart had plummeted.

The favor she had once done for him had probably been completely exhausted!

Christina saw this scene and secretly sneered.

"Ms. Spencer, you may not know, but your actions constitute defamation. If Miss Fisher is harmed because of this, you might even face criminal charges."

Jennifer's body trembled. She understood that she was really in trouble this time. She frantically looked around, hoping someone would save her.

However, no one was willing to help her.

Kelvin sighed. He had originally held a glimmer of hope for Jennifer, but now, he was completely disappointed.

"Not only that, but I also said you haven't found out the cause of the illness yet. If it really was intentional, you are the prime suspect."

"I didn't, I really didn't." Jennifer didn't know what else to say, just mechanically explaining herself.

Arnold gritted his teeth, looking like he was ready to sacrifice his own daughter for justice.

"Mr. Fisher, rest assured, we will investigate this matter thoroughly. If it really was my daughter, I will not cover for her."

"Alright, go ahead, your words sound nice." Kelvin waved his hand dismissively.

After the drama, everyone dispersed.

William called out to Christina.

Christina turned back and calmly said, "If you want to blame me, there's no need. I have reason and evidence, I'm just taking back what's mine."

His words were stuck in his throat.

Christina said no more and turned to leave.

Fortunately, after two or three days of testing, it was confirmed that Kaitlyn had been bitten by a mildly toxic insect from the swamp, which caused her to fall into a coma.

Once the cause was found, the treatment was quick.

On the third day, Kaitlyn woke up.

She opened her eyes and the first person she saw was Christina, which moved her deeply.

"Christina, I didn't expect you to stay by my side the whole time. I'm so touched."

"Alright, you don't know how chaotic it was outside while you were in a coma. It was almost like an explosion." Christina smiled helplessly.

Kaitlyn wanted to ask for the details, but Christina was too lazy to explain, so Kaitlyn searched online.

After learning the truth, Kaitlyn angrily pounded the bed.

"How dare she spread rumors while I was in a coma! Jennifer, that wicked woman, almost succeeded!"

Seeing Kaitlyn's indignant expression, Christina couldn't help but laugh, "It's all over now!"

"And she almost made you suffer unjustly. I said, if you wanted to harm me, you could have just left me in the swamp. Why bother pulling me out? It was completely unnecessary."

Kaitlyn quickly fiddled with her phone, not at all like someone who had been in a coma for several days.

When they left the hospital, they unexpectedly ran into William.

She thought he was there for her, but he hurriedly turned into another ward.

She didn't care, as it had nothing to do with her. While waiting at the discharge window for Kaitlyn, Bob showed up.

"Ms. Windsor!"

"What are you here for?" Christina asked hesitantly.

"Ms. Spencer is injured," Bob replied.

Oh, no wonder William was at the hospital.

His beloved was injured, so he had to come personally.

Christina felt like she had been bitten by a dog, afraid that Jennifer would blame her again, so she casually asked, "How did she get injured?"

Bob hesitated for a moment before answering, "Mr. Cavendish almost had a car accident. Ms. Spencer shielded him, got injured, and Mr. Cavendish was unharmed."

Another life-saving favor. Life-saving favor upon life-saving favor, she really was his eternal first love.

It had nothing to do with her, so Christina didn't comment. She saw Kaitlyn coming over.

"Alright, I have things to do, so I'll leave now. Take good care of Mr. Cavendish."

Leaving those words, she walked towards Kaitlyn.

When Kaitlyn saw the sunlight outside, she stretched lazily, "I feel like I've wasted these days in a coma. Christina, I need to make up for the lost time. Come play with me."

"So that's how you make up for lost time." Christina shook her head helplessly.

Kaitlyn hugged her arm and acted cute.

"Come on, come on."

"Alright, alright, just this once." Christina agreed.

After working on a few projects, she had firmly established herself in the architecture department.

Many people no longer held hostility towards her as they did when she first arrived, but some still remained cautious.

Christina didn't mind, she just focused on doing her job well.

Kelvin saw her stability and directly gave her a task, "This task isn't difficult, but it's urgent. You need to complete the design draft within three days."

She looked at the requirements, the time was just right, any less and it might not be doable.

But she still accepted it.

"Don't worry, Mr. Fisher, I will complete it well and not disappoint you."

After three days of overtime, she finally completed the drawings the day before the deadline.

###chapter 54: Do You Feel Proud Hiring Male Escorts?

Christina stretched contentedly, locked up the blueprints, and left the architecture institute.

A shadowy figure quietly appeared, opened her drawer, and after seeing the design blueprints, let out a cold laugh and poured a glass of water over them.

The entire design blueprint was instantly ruined, making it unrecognizable.

The next morning, when Christina arrived at the architecture institute, the client was already there. The boss's name was Theodore Reynolds.

Theodore was talking to Kelvin.

"This task is urgent, and it's a good thing we found you. Otherwise, we wouldn't know how to proceed."

Kelvin stroked his beard and laughed heartily, "I happen to have someone available who can help you."

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned and saw Christina walking in from outside and immediately waved her over, "This is the designer."

"So young." Theodore seemed to realize that his words might sound like he was doubting her, so he quickly added, "But young and capable. I've always trusted Kelvin's judgment."

Kelvin gave her a look, signaling her to quickly bring the design blueprints.

Christina walked over quickly and felt the drawer was damp as soon as she touched it. When she opened it, she found that the design blueprints she had carefully stored were soaked.

Bruce passed by and exaggeratedly shouted, "The blueprints that are due today, how did you store them? How could you let them get damaged?"

Christina raised an eyebrow. She hadn't known who did this, but now it was clear that it must have been Bruce.

She glanced at him, a faint cold smile on her lips, and calmly replied, "Bruce, you seem overly concerned."

Bruce was embarrassed by Christina's calm attitude and subtle sarcasm. He widened his eyes, wanting to argue, but ultimately said nothing.

Christina ignored him and turned to explain to Theodore and Kelvin, "The blueprints were completed last night. I checked them after storing them to ensure there were no issues. This situation is clearly intentional."

"Still, it's your fault for not storing them properly," Bruce snorted.

Theodore was very anxious, "These are due today. How can there be a mistake with urgent documents?"

Bruce smirked, thinking she was done for.

Unexpectedly, Christina calmly opened her computer, "Theodore, this is just the initial draft. The detailed blueprints are saved on the computer. How could I not be careful with such an important task? I made a backup long ago."

Bruce was stunned.

He had stayed late yesterday and didn't see her make a backup.

"Let me explain my design concept to you and see if you're satisfied." Christina made a gesture of invitation.

Christina opened her computer, displaying a clear design blueprint on the screen, and began to explain her design concept to Theodore in detail.

Her speech was fluent and her thoughts clear, making Theodore nod frequently and occasionally ask questions, showing great interest.

"This design fully considers the client's requirements while also taking into account environmental friendliness and practicality," Christina pointed to a part of the blueprint, "Here, we use some new construction techniques that can effectively reduce energy consumption and increase the building's lifespan."

Theodore listened attentively, occasionally glancing at Christina and then at the blueprint, a hint of satisfaction in his eyes. He turned to Kelvin and smiled, "Kelvin, it seems you really have an eye for talent. This designer is excellent."

Kelvin cleared his throat, pretending to be calm, "Of course, the designer I recommend can't be bad."

Theodore was very pleased, praising Christina repeatedly, especially for her backup plan.

After sending Theodore off, Kelvin nodded, "I really didn't misjudge you. You're young but very capable and diligent."

"Thank you for your praise. Since you took me as a student, I naturally won't let you down."

Kelvin laughed heartily, "I have a design for a cross-sea bridge. I was planning to handle it myself, but now that you're capable, I'll leave it to you."

Each building serves different functions.

And a cross-sea bridge is obviously much more important.

She hesitated for a moment, "Mr. Fisher, I..."

"I know what you're worried about. Don't worry, there's a whole team. Just go ahead and do it." Kelvin patted her shoulder.

Christina felt reassured and nodded firmly.

For the business trip, Kaitlyn found it interesting and wanted to go along.

Kelvin, knowing that his granddaughter had caused Christina a lot of trouble last time, directly pulled Kaitlyn back.

"Alright, stop messing around!"

Christina couldn't help but smile at their friendly interaction.

The plane landed three hours later, and it was still early, so she went directly for an on-site inspection.

The engineering team told her, "We're currently doing the surveying. Because the cross-sea bridge is quite challenging, every step of the project design needs to be repeatedly tested."

"Don't worry, I have the patience for that," Christina nodded.

The seaside air was indeed pleasant, but in this narrow bay, with no direct road between the two islands, one had to either take a ferry or drive along the coastal road, both of which were inefficient.

The bridge would facilitate communication between the two places and benefit the economy, making it a challenging but worthwhile task.

The engineering team added, "You can rest at the hotel today. Tomorrow we'll go on a boat for a sea inspection."

"Okay," Christina nodded.

As she turned to leave, she suddenly noticed William getting out of a luxury car and standing by the shore.

It seemed she could run into him anywhere. Their eyes met briefly before they both looked away indifferently.

Christina went straight back to the hotel.

When she came down for dinner in the evening, she unexpectedly ran into William again.

What a small world!

Christina lost her appetite and had her meal sent to her room.

Half an hour later, there was a knock on the door.

When she opened it, she was shocked by the scene outside.

Four six-foot-tall muscular male escorts stood in a row, each showing off their muscles, "Ms. Windsor, we're here to serve you tonight."

Christina was stunned. Who did this? And called four men at once.

"You..."

Before she could finish, a figure suddenly appeared.

It was William, raising an eyebrow, "You must be in good shape to handle four men in one night."

Christina was at a loss for words and pushed the men away, "You must have the wrong room."

The four male escorts said in unison, "No, it's room 1802, we're not mistaken."

Christina felt utterly disgusted, like she had swallowed a fly. William narrowed his cold eyes, "Is it an honor to hire male escorts? Do you want to show off to everyone?"

###chapter 55: William Has No Conscience

Listening to William's sarcastic tone, Christina felt very uncomfortable.

But her lifelong reputation couldn't possibly be ruined by these few male escorts, right? She waved her hand dismissively, "I didn't call you. Go wherever you want. Ask whoever called you for the money."

Then, she closed the door.

"Hey, we've already been paid. Don't you want our services? We even have performances."

The four male escorts were anxious.

William sneered, "You're feeling guilty because you've been exposed."

The four male escorts couldn't get the door open, so they had to leave.

The night passed uneventfully. The next day, Christina had planned to go for a marine survey early in the morning. Unexpectedly, she ran into William downstairs.

William called out to her directly.

"I'm going to the beach too. Let's go together."

"Uncle, there's no need." Christina politely declined.

Unexpectedly, William calmly wiped his mouth, "There are no other cars available for you."

Christina remembered that he had also appeared at the site of the transoceanic bridge yesterday. He might be part of the project, and if he said there were no other cars, there probably weren't. She had no choice but to compromise.

They drove to the beach, and the engineering team immediately came up to them, "Mr. Cavendish, you're here! Please, come inside."

"Who is this?" Someone noticed the new face beside William.

"Oh, I'm..." Christina was about to introduce herself.

But before she could finish, the person had a look of sudden realization, "You must be Mr. Cavendish's secretary, following him around. I didn't expect someone so young to be so accomplished. Please, come up."

"No, I'm..." Christina hadn't finished explaining.

William, with a look of indifference, said, "Everyone's here, let's set sail."

Damn it, he did it on purpose.

Christina couldn't find the right moment to speak.

No wonder they needed a transoceanic bridge; even taking a boat wasn't very efficient. The boat was swaying, and the engineering team briefly introduced the surveying situation.

"The deepest part of the sea is over a hundred feet, making construction very difficult."

Everyone nodded in understanding, listening intently. Christina, needing to do the design, took out her notebook and meticulously recorded all the data.

They boarded the boat in the morning, had lunch on the boat, and by the time they returned to shore, it was already evening.

The head of the engineering team suggested, "It's so late, why don't we go straight to the beach for a party? It'll be fun and lively."

William naturally had no objections.

Christina wasn't interested in these things, and she wanted to go back early to work on the bridge simulation based on the data.

As soon as she spoke, William immediately vetoed, "Everyone's going, you can't be antisocial."

"I'm a designer, not a business negotiator," Christina frowned.

William raised an eyebrow, his cold eyes narrowing.

"Are you in such a hurry to go back? Do you want to spend a wonderful night with those four male escorts from yesterday?"

"Uncle, what nonsense are you talking about?" Christina was shocked.

William stared into her eyes, "You can play however you want, but don't disgrace the Cavendish family. You must attend the party tonight."

Christina hesitated.

Forget it, arguing with someone like William was pointless.

Fine, I'll go!

The party at the beach villa was like a large-scale revelry.

Various bosses gathered, drinking and flirting with the young waitresses.

Christina stayed far away, sitting by the window, looking at the distant sea. The sky darkened, and the moon rose from the sea, dreamy and surreal.

Suddenly, a boss staggered over with a glass of wine.

"You're really beautiful. Want to have a drink? It's boring to sit here alone."

"No, I don't drink," Christina waved her hand to refuse.

"Business is about having fun," the boss directly brought the glass to her lips, almost forcing her.

"Drink up."

Christina tried to break free, but the other party was very strong.

At that moment, William suddenly appeared, grabbing the man's wrist, his eyes filled with coldness.

"You dare touch my person?"

The boss was really drunk, "Who are you?"

As he spoke, he waved his hand, and the glass shattered against the window, the broken glass cutting Christina's arm.

Christina stepped back in pain.

The people around reacted, immediately pulling the man away, "You're drunk, daring to offend Mr. Cavendish."

The boss sobered up a bit.

"Ah, I..."

"Sorry, Mr. Cavendish, we'll take him away to sober up."

Everyone was startled, quickly dragging the troublemaker away.

William frowned, "Is there a first aid kit?"

"Yes, yes," a waiter brought it over, intending to bandage Christina.

Unexpectedly, William blocked him.

"I'll do it myself!"

He skillfully took out the supplies from the first aid kit, disinfected with iodine, applied hemostatic powder, and bandaged her arm.

He was silent, his actions gentle, and his expression very serious.

In the slowly flowing time, Christina felt everything around her slow down, her heart sinking slightly.

She had never seen William so gentle. In her past life, he was always cold to her, like an enemy. When had he ever shown such an expression?

Complex emotions surged in her heart. She knew there was an unresolved grudge between them.

After a moment of confusion, she remembered the events of her past life. Her tragic death and her daughter's tragic death were all caused by William. How could this moment of gentleness make up for the loss of two lives?

Thinking of this, hatred filled her eyes.

Christina's gaze turned cold, and she forcefully pulled her arm away, but the wound was already bandaged.

William was surprised to see the coldness in her eyes, and he coldly accused, "How can you be so ungrateful?"

Christina took a deep breath, "I didn't ask for your help."

Christina's words made William pause for a moment, a complex look flashing in his deep eyes, but he quickly regained his composure.

"And I didn't want to come here. You insisted on bringing me," Christina said coldly, not wanting to develop any other possibilities in their interaction.

After saying that, she turned and left.

William watched her back, his eyes exceptionally cold.

"Where are you going?"

"Don't worry, I won't call for male escorts. I'm too tired tonight. I want to go back to the hotel to rest. Besides, I'm a designer, there's no need for me to attend such social events."

Leaving those words, Christina walked straight out.

The cool sea breeze outside brought a bit of clarity to her face.

Looking at his gentle eyes just now, she almost thought the William in front of her wasn't the cold person from her past life.

Fortunately, she was still clear-headed.

A person's nature is hard to change. William is heartless.

###chapter 56: How Dare You Cheat?

After returning to the hotel, Christina washed up and lay down on the bed to rest.
She was also reading up on design knowledge when, unexpectedly, her phone rang.
She opened it to find a message from the class group chat.
[The midterm exam will be held as scheduled. No one in the class can be absent. Those off-campus, return immediately.]
She hadn't finished her business yet, but the teacher's notification was clear.
The exam results are related to credits and GPA, which will affect subsequent internship arrangements.
So, upon receiving the notification, Christina returned to school as quickly as possible.

As for Jennifer, she wanted to target Christina, so she specifically asked her father to find someone to help and placed her in Christina's class.

She now takes the midterm exams very seriously and called Missy over in advance. The two of them stood in the hallway.

She asked, "Are you confident about this midterm exam?"

"I haven't studied much lately. As long as I don't fail, I'll be happy." Just thinking about the midterm exam made Missy anxious.

If she fails the midterm, she would need to score almost perfectly on the final exam to avoid failing the course.

If that happens, she would have to retake the exam and the course, and even during the holidays, she wouldn't be able to relax.

"I can get you the best tutor, focusing only on the key points. A few days of intensive tutoring, and passing won't be a problem. If you have any difficulties later, you can come to me directly." Jennifer made one false promise after another.

At first, Missy was quite happy.

If she could pass, who would want to fail?

But as she listened, she gradually sensed something was off. Why was Jennifer being so nice to her?

Missy suspected Jennifer had ulterior motives.

She asked directly, "What do you want me to do? You wouldn't be this nice to me for nothing."

"This midterm exam isn't just for the two of us; Christina will also participate. Last time, she made me suffer a lot, and I must get my revenge. As long as you help me, I'll give you whatever benefits you want."

Jennifer didn't beat around the bush and directly stated her purpose.

She wanted to ruin Christina's reputation, making all her exam results invalid. Only then could she vent her anger.

Missy also disliked Christina, and with the benefits Jennifer promised, she couldn't refuse. Without much thought, she agreed, "I'll help you."

"On the exam day, I'll sabotage the classroom's surveillance and bribe the teacher. You just need to throw a paper ball onto Christina's desk, and I'll handle the rest. She won't have a good outcome this time." Jennifer spoke confidently.

Schools have strict rules, especially regarding cheating.

Cheating not only invalidates the exam results but also leads to disciplinary action, which goes on the student's record. Even after graduation, which company would want to hire a student who was disciplined for cheating?

William would also dislike Christina even more because of this.

Coincidentally, Nicholas's birthday was coming up. If this incident reached Nicholas's ears, Christina would definitely be blacklisted by the Cavendish family and wouldn't even be able to attend the birthday party.

Thinking of this, Jennifer couldn't help but smile, "You go to college to find a good job and a good family to marry into. I can help you with both. I have so many followers online; just a few words of praise from me will do."

Missy nodded happily.

The two of them discussed for a long time before returning to the classroom.

When passing by Christina, Missy couldn't help but glance at her, her eyes full of calculation and pride.

Christina knew their characters well, and with that look, she immediately guessed that they were plotting against her.

They had been standing in the hallway for so long, probably discussing how to deal with her.

It seemed she needed to gather evidence in advance, just in case.

"Christina." Jennifer called her name suddenly after returning to her seat.

Christina turned her head, her eyes cold, "Do you need something?"

"I just wanted to remind you that the midterm exams are coming up. Everyone is studying hard, so you should too. Don't wait until the last minute to cram."

"Cramming at the last minute requires a smart brain to absorb the knowledge, right?" Missy mocked sarcastically.

Jennifer was amused by this and quickly stopped Missy, "Don't say that. We're all classmates; it's not nice to talk like that."

But her expression showed no sign of apology.

She was deliberately provoking Christina, hoping she would lose her temper in front of everyone and then get caught cheating during the exam.

This way, Christina's reputation at school would plummet.

Christina didn't get angry as they wished. Instead, she turned her head back, ignoring them completely.

Jennifer had never been ignored before, except by Christina!

Her face turned ugly.

"Don't mind her; she won't be smug for long." Missy quickly comforted Jennifer.

With Missy's persuasion, Jennifer's mood improved a bit.

In the next two days, Jennifer kept her promise and found the best tutor for Missy.

Missy crammed intensively until the night before the midterm exam before returning to the dormitory.

She had a good night's sleep and went to the exam room the next morning.

Her seat was right next to Christina's, with only an aisle between them, making it easy to throw a paper ball.

Soon, the proctor came in with the exam papers. He had already been informed by Jennifer and knew who Christina was.

Standing on the podium, he looked around and then tapped the podium with his pen, "You are all college students, not children. You know what you can and cannot do. Before the exam, I'll give you one last warning: it's okay if you don't do well in the midterm; you can improve your score in the final exam."

"Even if you really can't pass, you have the opportunity to retake the exam and the course. But if anyone cheats, that's crossing the school's bottom line. You all know the consequences. If you get caught, don't come to me for mercy."

He seemed to be speaking to all the students, but he was subtly hinting at Christina.

Christina saw through it but said nothing.

After receiving the exam paper, she first filled in her name and exam number on the answer sheet and then started answering the questions seriously.

An hour passed quickly. Missy finished the questions she knew and then wrote an answer on a piece of scratch paper. She crumpled the paper and, while the teacher's back was turned, threw it onto Christina's desk.

Christina's first reaction was to raise her hand and tell the teacher, but before she could, the teacher had already turned around and walked over angrily.

He grabbed the paper ball and shouted loudly, so everyone in the classroom could hear, "What is this? I made it very clear, and you still dare to cheat!"

###chapter 57: Deliberate Slander

Hearing the noise, all the students turned to look at Christina.

Their expressions varied, with some showing shock and others confusion, mixed with a couple of gloating glances.

Jennifer struggled to suppress the urge to laugh out loud.

This time Christina was definitely done for, and she was just waiting to watch the show.

"This paper ball isn't mine," Christina tried to explain.

But the teacher didn't want to listen at all. He directly opened the paper ball, pointed at the answers on it, and asked Christina, "It's written clearly here. What else can you argue? If this paper ball isn't yours, why was it on your desk?"

"Cheating during an exam shows poor character. Now that I've caught you red-handed, you still want to lie and deceive. A student like you should just drop out and go home. Your character is too poor."

Christina had only been somewhat suspicious before, but now she was 100% sure that this teacher was colluding with Jennifer to falsely accuse her of cheating.

Any normal teacher would investigate the situation first, rather than not even giving her a chance to speak.

"Do you admit your mistake now?" The teacher suddenly raised his voice.

He had used this trick many times before. After all, students generally had some fear of teachers.

As long as he was a bit more intimidating, Christina would definitely not dare to speak, let alone argue.

But he guessed wrong. Christina spoke very seriously, word by word, "The paper ball isn't mine, so of course I don't admit it. As a teacher, shouldn't you find out who threw this paper ball? If you can't figure it out, then I demand to see the surveillance footage."

"The classroom surveillance is broken. You must have known this in advance, which is why you dared to be so brazen. Luckily, I caught you red-handed. Otherwise, what would this exam have become?" The teacher's tone carried a hint of smugness.

If it weren't for the broken surveillance, he wouldn't dare to act like this.

A teacher falsely accusing a student is much more serious than a student cheating. If this were exposed, he would not only be fired by the school but also face other consequences.

"Then, teacher, look at my test paper. I've completed all the questions, both multiple-choice and essay questions, while the answers on this paper ball are incomplete, and many are wrong. Even if I wanted to copy, I wouldn't copy from it." Christina directly held up her test paper.

Although the test papers hadn't been graded yet, she was confident that she would score at least 95.

Neither Jennifer nor Missy had that ability.

If they wanted to falsely accuse her of cheating, they should at least have better grades than her.

Otherwise, it made no sense for an honor student to copy from a failing student.

The teacher was stunned for a moment. How could Christina's grades be so good?

This made the situation a bit tricky.

"Teacher, we've been taught since elementary school that everyone is equal. Whether a good student or a bad student, cheating is wrong. Whether or not someone cheated should be based on evidence," Jennifer couldn't sit still and reminded the teacher.

She had already transferred money to the teacher. If the teacher took the money but didn't do the job, she wouldn't let him off easily.

She had left evidence of the transaction. If the teacher took the money but didn't do the job, she could report him to the education department.

"Jennifer, don't deliberately confuse the issue. What I mean is that my grades are so good that I have no need to copy from someone with worse grades. Do I need to go to such lengths to fail?" Christina directly retorted.

Other students felt that Christina made sense.

Throughout history, only students with poor grades copied from those with good grades. No one had ever heard of the reverse.

Moreover, cheating in exams came with great consequences. Why would Christina make things difficult for herself?

Seeing the situation turning against him, the teacher got angry again and slammed the desk, "Stop arguing. I only found one paper ball. Who knows how many you had before? The evidence is clear. Come with me to the office. This exam is void."

He picked up a red pen and wrote a big zero on Christina's test paper.

He glanced at the others, "Continue your exam. Don't just watch the show. Look at the time. The exam is almost over. Have you finished your papers?"

The others quickly lowered their heads and continued answering.

Christina was taken to the office by the teacher. Before he could start scolding her, Christina asked, "Teacher, did you take a bribe to target me?"

The teacher was visibly flustered for a moment.

But the next second, he regained his composure. He and Jennifer had made the deal in private, with only the two of them knowing. No one else knew.

Christina couldn't possibly have evidence.

So it was still his word against hers.

He put on a stern face, "You were caught cheating. Even if you're upset, you can't maliciously slander me. Your character is too poor. I'll report this to your counselor and have the whole school criticize you."

Christina said nothing more, just looked at him coldly.

He had a way to falsely accuse her, and she had her own countermeasures. She had given him a chance earlier.

But clearly, the teacher wanted to persist in falsely accusing her, so he couldn't blame her.

Soon, the news of Christina cheating in the exam was announced to the whole school, and Jennifer took the opportunity to spread it online.

She already had a fan base, and everyone hated cheating, so the public opinion was overwhelmingly against Christina.

"When I was caught cheating in school, I felt so guilty and kept begging the teacher for forgiveness. How dare she confront the teacher directly?"

"This is the new generation of selfish individualists. Although her cheating is unfair to others, she can pass the exam. The teacher upholding fairness and justice is just against her?"

"Expel her. Her moral character is too low."

"I remember Christina won first place in a competition before. If she has the ability to win first place, why would she need to cheat in a midterm exam? Maybe she cheated to win first place too?"

"That makes sense. I suggest a thorough investigation."

Jennifer sat in front of her computer all afternoon, constantly refreshing the online comments, her smile growing wider.

Christina, Christina, what will you do now?

###chapter 58 The Truth Comes Out

Outside the dormitory, there was a sudden knock on the door. Jennifer quickly closed her laptop and went to open the door.

Standing at the door was Missy.

She rushed into the dormitory at the fastest speed and then closed the door. "Everyone is cursing Christina right now, but she has no reaction at all, staying quiet. It's too abnormal."

"Do you think she's holding some bad intentions in her heart?"

Jennifer sneered, not taking Christina seriously at all.

She returned to her seat, "I think you're overthinking it. Christina cheating is already a settled matter, the school has already punished her. What can she do now?"

To put it bluntly, the reason Christina is staying quiet is because she knows that nothing she does now will help.

Moreover, the more she does, the more mistakes she will make.

"You know the school's rules. If she has a good attitude in admitting her mistake, the punishment can be revoked later. If she refuses to admit it, the punishment will be more severe." Jennifer became more and more complacent as she spoke.

She exposed this matter to completely block Christina's way of solving the problem.

Even if the punishment is revoked, everyone will know what kind of person she is.

"That's true, but this won't come back to us, right? What if she goes crying to Mr. Cavendish..." Missy was still a bit worried.

Jennifer laughed, "You're overestimating her. She's not that important to Mr. Cavendish."

Who is William?

How could he personally intervene in such a trivial matter at school!

With Jennifer's reassurance, Missy stopped overthinking, and the two even had the mind to discuss where to go next.

Meanwhile, Christina.

She not only had the surveillance footage from the school corridor that day but also evidence of Missy bribing the teacher on her computer.

These two pieces of evidence were enough to prove her innocence.

She went straight to the principal's office, knocked on the door, and then pushed it open.

"Christina, what brings you here?" The principal, who had heard the commotion in the school over the past few days, recognized Christina.

Seeing her suddenly come over, the principal's first reaction was that she was here to plead.

Similar things had happened before.

Punishments indeed have a significant impact on students' futures, but this was written in the school's rules and regulations. He couldn't possibly pardon someone.

If he let Christina off today, others would come to plead tomorrow. Should he let them off or not?

"Principal, I did not cheat, and I have evidence to prove my innocence." Christina didn't waste any words.

She directly presented the two videos, "I guarantee that the videos have not been tampered with. If you don't believe me, you can check them. I am willing to bear all consequences."

After watching the videos, the principal's face turned grim.

If the videos were real, this matter would escalate from a student cheating to a teacher corruption case, completely changing its nature.

"There are also many people online cursing me, seriously affecting my life, so I reported it to the police. I have also submitted this evidence to them." Christina never fought unprepared battles.

She wanted more than just to clear her name; she wanted everyone who framed her to pay the price.

Wasn't Jennifer slandering her online with great enthusiasm?

Jennifer had her fun, now it was Christina's turn.

"Christina, send the evidence to my email. I will investigate this matter thoroughly. If you are innocent, the school will definitely clear your name." The principal took this matter very seriously.

Christina left with peace of mind.

Since the matter had been reported to the police, the principal wouldn't dare to cover for the teacher, so she had nothing to worry about.

With the joint investigation of the police and the principal, the truth soon came to light.

Christina was indeed framed. The teacher had accepted a bribe from a student, and the two had conspired to frame Christina.

The principal even held a morning meeting to clear Christina's name.

Throughout the meeting, Jennifer's face was particularly ugly. She couldn't understand how Christina managed to escape when she had calculated everything.

It didn't make any sense.

Missy, standing next to her, was even more panicked. She whispered to Jennifer, "Now that the matter is so clear, will it implicate us?"

Jennifer glanced at her and had already made a decision in her heart.

When she did this, she had made all the preparations. Although she provided the money, it was Missy who met with the teacher, and the evidence was on Missy's computer.

Now, Jennifer naturally had to protect herself.

"I will give you a large sum of money, and I will also arrange jobs for your parents." Jennifer didn't directly answer her question but made this promise.

Missy had a growing sense of foreboding.

She couldn't help but grab Jennifer's hand, her voice trembling, "What do you mean by this? Explain it to me. Are you planning to abandon me?"

"If you don't want your parents to lose their jobs, you'd better stay away from me now." Jennifer pulled her hand away.

Her tone became more threatening, "I can find good jobs for your parents, and I can also make your whole family lose their jobs. You know what to do, don't you?"

Missy's lips trembled more and more.

She wanted to say something, but no words came out. How could Jennifer do this to her?

She was clearly helping Jennifer!

"Missy." The principal suddenly called her name, and everyone turned to look at her.

"Why did you deliberately frame your classmate? What good does it do you?"

"I, I..." Missy couldn't say a word.

She didn't have the mental strength to withstand this. The whispers around her kept breaking down her psychological defenses.

In the end, she ran away covering her face.

Christina sneered at her back, "She dares to do it but not to face the consequences. There's no such good thing in the world. I will pursue this matter to the end."

As for Jennifer.

Christina didn't have clear evidence to prove Jennifer's involvement, but even if she did nothing, people online were already cursing Jennifer.

Jennifer had been the one who confidently accused Christina of cheating. The happier she was then, the worse she was being cursed now.

Many of Jennifer's fans were mocking her.

"Jennifer, we thought you were telling the truth, but it turns out you were spreading rumors. Really, you're so shameless!"

###chapter 59: I Will Absolutely Cooperate with the Police

"How disgusting, how could I have been a fan of someone like Jennifer before? A few words from her almost ruined Christina's life."

"Jennifer is also a victim. You fake fans, if you want to blame someone, blame Missy. Why are you blaming Jennifer? Everyone thought Christina was cheating, not just Jennifer."

"Yeah, we are fake fans because we have rationality, unlike some true fans who have no brains at all."

"She is a public figure with so many fans, is she the same as ordinary people? Do the people saying this even understand the law?"

"They are already irrational fans, so of course, they have no brains. Forget it, just let them be."

Jennifer was on the verge of tears as she read these comments.

She had worked so hard to attract so many fans, and now because of Christina, she had lost a lot of them.

She was overwhelmed, and during this time, Missy called her for help, "Jennifer, I don't want your money, my parents don't need you to help them find jobs, please help me resolve this issue, I don't want to go to jail."

"You won't, you definitely won't go to jail, don't worry about that." Jennifer, having no energy to deal with her, casually brushed her off, wanting to end the conversation.

Missy cried even harder, "Even if I don't go to jail, the school will definitely expel me. I worked so hard to get into this school, if I get expelled, what will I do in the future?"

If she had known things would turn out this way, she wouldn't have agreed to help Jennifer in the first place.

Jennifer finally came up with an idea, "Why don't you go and beg Christina for mercy?"

Missy actually went.

Christina looked at her like she was an idiot the whole time, "How do you have the nerve to come to me? You wanted to ruin me, and now you expect me to forgive you?"

"I know I was wrong, I will never..."

"Don't tell me these things, I don't want to hear it." Christina turned and walked away.

Missy was left standing there alone.

Fear and resentment mixed together, eventually turning into hatred towards Christina.

Christina didn't suffer any loss, so why did she have to push her so hard?

If she was going to be expelled, then Christina shouldn't have it easy either.

Missy went to an internet cafe, created a small account, and started spreading rumors online.

How did Christina get those two videos?

Wasn't it because William helped her!

But why did William help her? Of course, it was because Christina used her affection for William to threaten him with the Cavendish family name.

Many people were paying attention to Christina, and with this matter involving William, it quickly became a hot topic, with all sorts of comments flying around.

"She was wronged and couldn't solve it on her own, so she asked someone to help prove her innocence. There's nothing wrong with that, why blame the victim? Focus on the perpetrator!"

"She's so scheming at such a young age, Christina is no good either."

"No wonder she was targeted, everything has a reason."

"In this day and age, why are we still demanding perfect victims? Not to mention the authenticity of the online revelations is questionable, even if every word is true, does Christina deserve to be slandered?"

"By that logic, if my neighbor stepped on my foot yesterday and didn't apologize, I should be able to rob his house today."

Missy, in a fit of rage, hired online users to manipulate public opinion.

She had nothing left, so she wanted revenge.

On William's side.

Seeing the online comments, his face turned dark. He was about to find Christina when she called him first, "You must have seen the news online, please come forward and clarify that you never helped me."

"Why should I clarify just because you ask me to? Who am I to you?" William coldly retorted.

Why should he listen to Christina!

Christina was speechless, "I'm asking you to come forward and tell the truth, not to help me. Isn't it good for both of us if you clarify?"

"If you enjoy the malicious speculation about our relationship online, then go ahead. Honestly, I benefit from it."

Although she disliked William, she had to admit that his name commanded respect.

This was a blessing in disguise for her.

"Christina, how shameless can you be?" William's face turned even darker.

Christina rolled her eyes, "If you don't want to clarify, then people will continue to misunderstand. Do you have a better solution? Anyway, I've told you, do as you see fit."

She hung up the phone.

William was furious, but he had to admit that the best choice now was to do as Christina said.

He didn't want to be linked to Christina in rumors.

He called his assistant and gave instructions to clarify the situation and sent invitations to the most vocal marketing accounts.

The Cavendish Corporation had the best legal team in the industry, and they never lost a case.

The marketing accounts, who only wanted to make a quick buck, were terrified when they realized they had angered William. They quickly deleted their posts and privately apologized to William's assistant, groveling in the process.

They didn't want to face a lawsuit!

Meanwhile, Christina, after resolving the online rumors, wanted to find out who was behind it.

Missy had some precautions but not enough.

She only created a small account but didn't change her IP address. Following this lead, Christina quickly traced it to an internet cafe outside the school.

Knowing that the cafe owner might not cooperate if she went alone, she called the police and went with them.

Seeing the police, the cafe owner was visibly nervous, his tone lowering, "Our shop has always operated legally, we haven't done anything illegal, what's this about?"

"We received a report that someone was spreading rumors in your cafe, we need to investigate."

"Please come in." The owner, relieved that it wasn't about him, quickly agreed, "I will fully cooperate with the police."

The police quickly pulled up footage of Missy at the cafe, and Christina handed the evidence to the school.

The principal, already considering expelling Missy, didn't hesitate and issued a notice for her to leave the school that day.

Missy didn't expect to be exposed so quickly, but with the counselor helping her pack, she had no choice but to leave the school in disgrace.

###chapter 60: Christina, wait a moment

Christina had long known who was behind the public opinion this time, just as she was planning to take further action.

Elisa arrived.

Seeing her mother, Christina remembered her mother's resoluteness that day in the hospital, including the phone call afterward.

Christina quickly stopped her thoughts, not wanting to think deeply.

As Christina stepped forward, Elisa spoke in a hoarse voice, "You haven't asked me for money or sent me messages recently. I only saw your news on the media."

"Why are you working so hard to prove yourself?" Elisa originally wanted to send Christina a message, but then thought it would be better to meet in person.

So, she came to find Christina.

"To prove myself."

What else could it be?

Whether it's a competition or participation, it's all for herself.

Only this way could she be noticed by others.

"I don't think you're proving yourself. All your actions seem to be comparing yourself to Jennifer. If you like him..."

"I don't like him."

Mentioning Jennifer, Christina thought of William related to Jennifer.

In this life, she only lived for herself. How could she be involved with William?

"Mom, you didn't mention blind dates before, and now you're bringing this up?" Christina was truly exhausted.

In her past life, her mother knew she was involved with William, and later she got pregnant, thinking she had the best support.

When she was disheartened and wanted a divorce, what did her mother say to her?

"Christina, you don't know how to cherish your good fortune. Others don't even have a chance to touch a finger of William, and you want to divorce him."

"So what if he has mistresses? No matter how many mistresses he has, they can't shake your position as the legitimate Mrs. Cavendish."

It was because of these words that Christina held onto the last bit of hope, thinking that when her child was sick, it could awaken William's last bit of conscience.

In the end, she harmed her daughter Harper.

She felt immense guilt.

In this life, Christina's mind was exceptionally clear, "I don't like him. No matter how good he is, no matter what rumors spread around, I won't be involved with him."

"If you have time to focus on me, why not think about how to work on getting pregnant yourself."

"You!"

Elisa's face changed dramatically, "Christina, how can you say such things to me?"

Elisa had been married into the Cavendish family for many years and had never conceived Raymond's child.

Raymond had his own children, so he wasn't in a hurry, but for many couples, especially in wealthy families, maintaining a relationship often relied on children.

Elisa not being able to conceive had always been a pain for her, and now this pain was being torn open by her own daughter. How could Elisa remain calm?

Seeing Elisa's angry expression, Christina knew her words had hit a sore spot.

But she really didn't want Elisa to focus all her attention on her.

"What I said is true. It's not too late for you and Raymond to have a child now. See more doctors and keep a good mindset, and you'll naturally get pregnant."

Unless someone was preventing Elisa from getting pregnant.

If that person was Raymond, then it would be better. He and Elisa only talked about interests, not involving other matters.

Elisa poked Christina's forehead, "I'm talking about your issues, and you're talking about mine. Christina, do you even see me as your mother?"

"Of course I do. Otherwise, why would I say these things to you?"

She was now in the architecture institute, which was an opportunity she never even dreamed of in her past life. Now that she was in the architecture institute, she had to cherish her time.

She didn't have the time to keep arguing with Elisa here.

"I'm very busy here. Take care of yourself, and let's skip the pleasantries." Christina turned and walked back.

Seeing her like this, Elisa was furious.

But what could she do? Christina had already walked away.

The others in the architecture institute saw Christina like this and couldn't help but secretly gossip, "Look at her, she has no status, and she gets along so poorly with her own mother. Who knows who saw her abilities?"

"Wasn't the Golden Cup Award already decided? She was directly recruited by our Kelvin."

"And Kelvin's granddaughter, including that person, weren't they all attracted to Christina?"

"Speaking of that person, just look at William. If he had nothing to do with Christina, why would he care about her and not others? Are there so many coincidences?"

"I think."

"Ever since Christina came to our architecture institute, there's been a lot more gossip."

"Didn't you see her storming to the leader to report Jennifer that day? Even though Jennifer brought William, he didn't say anything when Christina repeatedly mocked Jennifer."

Christina originally thought that coming to the architecture institute wasn't easy, and she would do her work while letting these people gossip as they pleased.

But these people were getting more and more excessive.

This wasn't her past life, and Christina felt she didn't need to endure anymore.

Christina immediately walked towards the group, "Are you all very idle? Have you finished your design drafts?"

"Every day, it's either saying this about me or finding fault with that. Excuse me, do I eat your food or spend your money? I have nothing to do with you, so why do you lecture me? Do you all like playing parents? Then why didn't you stand up to help me when something happened?"

Thinking about Kaitlyn's incident and these people slandering her, she was furious.

She knew that in terms of family background, she couldn't compare to Jennifer.

But besides crying in front of William, who else would help Jennifer?

These people originally wanted to argue with Christina, but Kelvin stepped in at this moment.

Kelvin scolded in a low voice, "You people, enough is enough. Are you all very idle? If so, how about everyone works overtime until 10 PM starting today?"

They fell silent, not daring to speak, not wanting to offend Kelvin.

Everyone knew that Kelvin was not only a senior member of the architecture institute but also a respected public official, a fact everyone acknowledged.

Seeing everyone disperse, Christina didn't stay in place either.

When she was about to leave, Kelvin called out to her, "Christina, wait a moment."

Christina turned to look at Kelvin, "Mr. Fisher, is there something you need?"

"You were indeed outstanding in the Golden Cup Award, but how did you know Jennifer would plagiarize you by submitting two works?"

Considering everything, Kelvin was puzzled.

Christina seemed to know everything. She first came forward to report Jennifer for hiring a ghostwriter, and then submitted two works in the competition.

###chapter 61 The Deepest Irony

As it turned out, Jennifer was exactly like that.

Christina knew that trying to brush off Kelvin with a simple "it's nothing" wouldn't fly. But she also couldn't just make up some random excuse.

She thought for a moment, then slowly said, "Kelvin, Jennifer and I have some personal issues. You know, the work she plagiarized back then was directly linked to something I had published."

Kelvin got the picture.

But then again, Jennifer had only hired a ghostwriter; her exam scores were legit.

Jennifer was indeed a top student.

Plus, Arnold had come to him to plead on her behalf.

Even Glenn had stepped in.

So, he had to have a word with Christina, the person directly involved.

"We, the leaders, have discussed it. Jennifer's been suspended for quite a while now. One mistake shouldn't ruin her whole life."

"Kelvin, who you leaders decide to keep or let go is your business. I can't interfere. I've got a lot of work to finish, so I need to get going."

From the moment Kelvin started talking, Christina knew what he was getting at.

He wanted Jennifer to come back.

But how could she possibly stop Jennifer from returning to the architecture institute?

Jennifer could come back easily, but the reputation she lost would never be restored.

Watching Christina walk away, Kelvin felt a heavy weight in his heart.

Why did Christina seem to have seen through everything and remained so aloof, while he felt trapped in the mundane?

These words, however, were overheard by Stanley.

Stanley approached Christina, "You just said you have personal issues with Jennifer?"

He hadn't interacted much with Jennifer. At the architecture institute, she was praised by the leaders as a talented woman. Now that her ghostwriting scandal was exposed, he felt disgusted.

On the other hand, Christina had stood out at the Golden Cup Awards.

Even in front of so many people, she had never shown any fear.

But Christina said she had personal issues with Jennifer.

Could it be true, as the rumors suggested, that it was because of her uncle William?

"Do you have a problem with that?"

Christina spoke calmly.

She hadn't forgotten why Kaitlyn was hostile towards her.

"No problem. It's just that, well, nothing really. The workload has been pretty heavy lately. If you need any help, feel free to ask me."

Stanley had a gentle expression.

Christina shook her head, "Thanks for the offer, but I don't have anything that needs solving right now."

Christina left.

In this life, she didn't want to have any contact with William, and naturally, she didn't want to get involved with any other men, especially those who could affect her.

Christina returned to her desk, thinking she would work late and not go home. Unexpectedly, William called her.

She didn't want to answer William's call.

But then a message from William popped up: [Come out, I'm outside.]

William was always so concise.

Christina wanted to ignore him, but knowing William's temper, if she didn't respond, he would definitely stride in.

Rather than waiting for William to come find her, she decided to go out first.

Christina grabbed her bag and walked out, immediately spotting William's black Maybach.

Bob was driving in the front, and the back window was rolled down, revealing William's cold face.

She pursed her lips and reluctantly opened the car door to sit in the back.

"I told you you're obsessed with me, and you didn't believe it. Aren't you tired of this? And aren't you afraid your fiancée will come after me?"

"When did I ever say Jennifer was my fiancée?"

William's face darkened, his expression as cold as iron.

His black eyes were filled with endless sharpness and ferocity.

A mocking smile appeared on Christina's lips, "She's your lifesaver, your precious one. You have no burdens, and she wants to marry you. Wouldn't you agree to any of her conditions?"

Christina leaned back in her seat.

She had a strong hatred for William. She could mock him without hesitation, even ridicule him.

William's eyes darkened, "Who told you she was my lifesaver?"

Christina's breath hitched.

Damn!

She didn't know what kind of relationship Jennifer and William had now.

William was already suspicious, especially since Missy had handed over those, her Twitter bio.

Christina felt a massive headache.

But her silence only made William more suspicious. His eyes were fierce, "Christina, speak up. Are you mute?"

"No. I just overheard you and Jennifer talking once after school. Didn't Jennifer often come to see you back then?"

Christina tried to deflect.

William wasn't so easily fooled. He grabbed Christina's wrist and pulled her close.

Christina's frown only fueled William's anger. He had an overwhelming urge to tear her apart, "Christina, do you think I believe your nonsense?"

"Why wouldn't you? I'm just a 21-year-old college student. What could I possibly do? Even if I wanted to investigate, I couldn't afford it."

"You're hurting me."

Christina struggled, but William wouldn't let go.

Seeing her like this, William's mind flashed with memories of her begging under him. His breath quickened.

Christina saw William's Adam's apple move, saw the deep desire in his eyes.

Instinctively, she wanted to escape. In her past life, except for that one time she was drugged, William's intimacy with her was always a form of punishment.

It was like that in the past life, so what about this life?

Men really do think with their lower halves.

Christina found it ironic. In her past life, she had tried so hard to get close to William, only to be met with coldness and rejection.

Now William was reacting like this.

"William, don't you find it disgusting to have feelings for your niece?"

Christina's voice dripped with sarcasm.

William's grip tightened around her neck, his teeth clenched, "Are you? What does the Cavendish family have to do with you?"

"Nothing, but I came to the Cavendish family with my mom. My mom is your sister-in-law, so I call you uncle. Otherwise, why would the whole Cavendish family be so furious about what happened that night?"

Christina seized the moment, hitting the most sensitive spot, the deepest insult.

William's grip tightened, but Christina didn't back down. She grabbed William's collar...

###chapter 62: Have You Burned Your Brain with a Fever?

William wanted to make a move on her, but she wasn't one to be messed with.

"You're asking for it."

William spat out the words, and the tension between them was giving Bob, who was in the front seat, a headache.

William and Christina had clashed too many times.

William was furious with Christina, saying the harshest things, yet he never actually did anything to her. It was clear that Christina was special to him.

What was it between Christina and William?

To Bob, they were like sworn enemies.

Christina smirked, "If I die, you won't be any better off. Otherwise, you would've done something to me already, right?"

"Bob, pull over and let her out."

William's voice was filled with rage.

Bob slammed on the brakes.

Christina immediately tried to escape, but William grabbed her back.

Christina's body was thrown harshly onto the seat. William's dark eyes glared at her like knives, "Didn't you say I'm addicted to you? I'll show you what real addiction is."

"William, are you crazy?"

Christina struggled fiercely.

The painful memories of her past life were still vivid. In this life, she had been reborn and had avoided any intimate contact with William.

Now, William's stance made it clear he was targeting her.

The thought of physical contact with him made her instinctively nauseous.

"Let go... ugh!"

Christina couldn't hold back, and her reaction infuriated William.

William squinted his eyes, "Do I disgust you that much?"

"What do you think? If I didn't, I would've made you take responsibility long ago, and I wouldn't be taking birth control pills. William, you really make me sick!"

Christina gritted her teeth, her eyes filled with intense hatred.

William saw it-this was pure hatred towards him.

He was a bit surprised, "Christina, did something else happen between us?"

Otherwise, why would Christina hate him so much?

"What do you think? You think your memory is faulty? Is that even possible?" Christina's mocking smile was evident.

The idea that William's memory could be faulty was laughable to her.

"William, not everyone likes you."

"Then how do you explain your Twitter bio?"

"So what? Who hasn't misjudged someone when they were young?"

Before William could finish, Christina cut him off with a sneer.

Christina didn't take William seriously at all.

William's face turned dark. He hadn't expected Christina to say that her past affection for him was a mistake.

Seeing his expression, as if he had eaten something foul, Christina's smile deepened, "What, you think you're the dollar bill and everyone should like you?"

William wasn't the dollar bill, but people wanted to work for him because of his money and power.

"I don't expect that."

William's face was grim. He didn't mean that, and he didn't want Christina to misunderstand him.

Christina didn't believe him. She scoffed, "Your tone just now clearly implied you wanted me to like you. But I can't bring myself to like you at all."

"William, the person I hate the most is you. Did you know that? I wish you were dead."

Christina's hatred grew as she spoke.

If looks could kill, Christina would have torn William to pieces.

Seeing the intense hatred in Christina's eyes, William was incredulous, "Christina, your look can't fool me. Something must have happened between us."

"Happened? Do you think I hate you because I love you and can't have you?" Christina's cold smile was full of sarcasm.

Her eyes were icy.

William remained silent.

Even if Christina was like this, her hatred for him shouldn't be this intense. His instincts told him that something else had happened between them.

"Christina, you're targeting Jennifer, hating me, and avoiding any contact with me. Were you possessed?" William's eyes suddenly became sharp.

There had been reports of such things, and Christina's behavior really seemed like she was possessed.

Especially with the recent popularity of some reincarnation romance novels.

Christina felt a chill down her spine at William's words.

She hadn't expected William to be so perceptive.

But then again, if she didn't admit it, what could William do? Christina touched William's forehead, frowning thoughtfully, "William, did you get a fever and burn your brain?"

"What nonsense are you talking about?"

William pushed Christina's hand away.

His face was clouded with darkness.

Christina remained unfazed, her smile unchanged, "Is it me with the problem, or you? William, it's the 21st century. Don't you think saying such things is ridiculous?"

William didn't respond, but his eyes were cold and fixed on Christina, not allowing her any escape.

Christina remained calm, "Weren't you the one spouting nonsense first?"

William's face was stern, "So you're saying I'm the one causing trouble for you?"

Christina laughed softly.

Her meaning was clear.

"Christina, stop spreading lies about me. Don't use those thoughts on me. I'm telling you, I won't let you..."

"Live or die in peace."

"Or die a horrible death?"

Christina laughed softly, almost finishing his sentence.

William hadn't expected Christina to almost finish his sentence. Was this still Christina?

William gripped Christina's waist, squinting, "You know me that well?"

"It's not that I know you, but you always do this. Don't you find it boring?"

Christina didn't hold back in mocking William.

William's face grew darker, his expression clouded. In all these years, no woman had ever called him boring to his face.

He didn't speak, but Christina understood his meaning.

"William, this just shows how indifferent I am to you. You should know that. Stop bothering me. I'm not interested in you. To me, you're not some heartthrob."

With that, Christina pushed him again.

But William stood like a mountain in front of her, impossible to move.

Finally, Christina got angry, "William, you always do this. Do you find it fun? Do you come to me every time you're angry to use me as a punching bag?"

###chapter 63 Trying on Dresses

"I never saw you as a punching bag," William said, his voice sincere.

Who would treat someone like her that way?

Even these two incidents were caused by Christina herself, and he had to clean up the mess.

He hadn't even said anything, yet Christina was the one who got angry!

"You know damn well if you've treated me like a punching bag or not. Let go of me, William. What, you planning to kidnap me now? Don't forget our relationship, and don't forget the rumors out there!" Christina just wanted to leave.

She really didn't want anything to do with William.

William could see it all in her eyes. He wasn't trying to force Christina to stay by his side. "I just want to know what happened. Why have you changed so much, and where's all this hostility coming from?"

"Just tell me the truth, and I'll let you go."

Christina laughed, but it was more out of frustration than humor.

She really wanted to crack open William's skull to see what was inside that made him say such things.

Why should she tell him anything?

"I don't owe you anything. I'll say it one last time, let go of me. You don't want the news of the Cavendish family bullying people to get out, do you?"

"As long as I don't want it to, that news will never get out." William's patience was wearing thin.

Was he supposed to be afraid of Christina's threats?

As she just said, she was just a student now, probably couldn't even afford a private investigator, let alone go against him.

The tension between them was escalating.

Suddenly, Christina's phone rang.

She glanced at the screen; it was a call from Raymond. She had to answer it.

Out of respect for Raymond, William didn't say anything more. He didn't let Christina go, but he didn't interfere further either.

Because they were so close, he could hear the voice on the other end of the call.

"Christina, where are you? Tomorrow is Nicholas's birthday party, and we need to be there early. It's late, and you're still out. Just send me your location, and I'll come pick you up."

Christina looked at William while holding the phone.

Her message was clear: if William didn't let her go now, she would give Raymond her location and have him come over.

No matter how powerful he was, could he really stop Raymond from leaving?

William's face darkened. She was clever, using Raymond to pressure him.

He gave Bob a look, and Bob quickly opened the car door.

Christina got out of the car with her phone, ignoring William. She looked around and chose a landmark to tell Raymond.

"Wait for me a bit. I'm heading there now, should be there soon." Raymond hung up and immediately drove over to pick her up.

By the time he arrived, William was long gone, and Christina was standing alone by the roadside.

He opened the car door, signaling Christina to get in.

On the way home, they didn't talk much. When they opened the door, Christina immediately saw Elisa standing in the living room with a bunch of dresses.

She felt an urge to turn around and leave.

"Christina, come here! I picked out a bunch of dresses for you. See which one you like," Elisa called out enthusiastically, pulling her over to the sofa.

Raymond wasn't interested in women's fashion.

Besides, Christina was about to try on clothes, and it wasn't appropriate for him to stick around. He found an excuse to go upstairs. "I'm beat. I'll go rest in the bedroom. You two take your time."

"Alright, I'll bring you some fruit after we pick a dress," Elisa said, focusing all her attention on Christina.

Nicholas was the backbone of the Cavendish family, and his birthday was a big deal.

Everyone would be at the party tomorrow.

This included Gabrielle, who had previously had a falling out with Christina. Whether Elisa wanted to show off in front of Gabrielle or please Nicholas, she wanted Christina to look stunning.

She held up one dress after another against Christina. "Your skin is so fair. I think green would look great on you. What do you think?"

"I don't care what I wear," Christina said indifferently.

Her attitude immediately angered Elisa.

Elisa put down the dress, frowning. "Christina, I arranged for all these dresses to be sent over and had your father pick you up so you could look amazing at the party. How can you be so indifferent?"

Elisa could really drive Christina crazy sometimes.

When Christina and William had their incident, Christina's indifference was one thing. But then Elisa tried to set up dates for Christina, and what happened?

Elisa's face had been thoroughly embarrassed.

Even attending Nicholas's birthday party, such a simple thing, Christina had to show this attitude.

"Everything I do is for you. Do you want to drive me to my grave?"

"What you call doing things for me is just me giving in step by step to fulfill your wishes." Christina had barely said a few words when Elisa started shaking with anger.

She clutched her chest, breathing heavily.

Seeing her like this, what could Christina say?

No matter what, Elisa was her mother. She couldn't ignore her mother's health.

She silently picked up the dress that had fallen to the floor. "I think the green one looks nice too. I'll go change."

Elisa didn't say anything.

When Christina came back in the green dress, it made her skin look even fairer. Her exposed legs were straight and slender, and her waist was so small it could be held with one hand.

"I've arranged for a makeup artist for you tomorrow. Get up early, change into your dress, and get your makeup done. We need to be at the Cavendish Mansion by ten in the morning," Elisa said, her mood improving a bit.

Elisa had everything planned out. Christina nodded. "I know. I'll get up at six tomorrow."

"You can paint, right? Show Nicholas your skills tomorrow. Prepare tonight so you don't embarrass yourself," Elisa instructed before heading upstairs to find Raymond.

Christina's painting would be her way of showing respect. Elisa and Raymond also needed to prepare a birthday gift for Nicholas. Even if it wasn't the best, it couldn't be the worst.

###chapter 64 Shocked the Entire Audience

The next morning, Elisa went to Christina's bedroom to wake her up.

"Mom? What are you doing here so early?" Christina mumbled, rubbing her eyes.

She grabbed her phone and checked the time. It was only 5:40 AM, still twenty minutes before six.

She sighed, feeling a bit exasperated. "Didn't we agree on six? I already set my alarm."

"The earlier you get up, the more time you have to get ready. What if you don't finish in time? Everyone else will be there early, and we'll be the only ones arriving late. That wouldn't look good. Come on, get up," Elisa insisted, not feeling the least bit guilty.

With Elisa's nagging, Christina couldn't go back to sleep. She got out of bed, made her bed, washed her face quickly, and went downstairs to change.

The makeup artist Elisa had hired was already waiting downstairs. As she worked on Christina's makeup, she complimented, "Ms. Windsor, your skin is so fair and flawless. You don't even need concealer, just a light layer of foundation."

"Don't make the makeup too heavy. Nicholas doesn't like women with too much makeup. It should match her student image," Elisa reminded the makeup artist.

After all, Christina was still a student. A student should look like one. If she wore heavy makeup, not only would Nicholas dislike it, but William would too.

The makeup artist agreed immediately.

She chose brown eyeshadow and a light shade of lipstick, keeping the overall look very natural.

Elisa watched for a while before feeling satisfied and went to get herself ready.

Two hours later, the three of them were ready. Raymond drove them to the Cavendish Mansion.

On the way, Elisa reminded Christina of various things to keep in mind, which Christina found annoying and promptly forgot.

As luck would have it, when they arrived, Raymond's second brother's wife, Gabrielle, was also arriving.

Elisa opened the car door and saw Gabrielle, her expression immediately souring.

"I knew I should have checked my horoscope before leaving. What bad luck," Gabrielle rolled her eyes dramatically.

She looked at Elisa, then at Christina behind her, not hiding the disdain in her eyes.

Gabrielle had met Raymond's second brother through an arranged introduction, so she knew their background well. But Elisa and Raymond? Elisa was restless, and her daughter wasn't much better. Christina was still so young, not even graduated, and had already slept with William. The whole family knew about it, and they still had the nerve to show up.

But then again, like mother, like daughter. With Elisa's behavior, how could her daughter be any better?

Elisa felt a surge of anger and retorted sarcastically, "You need to check your horoscope before leaving the house? You must be so important. Your presence is grander than Nicholas's."

After all, it was Nicholas's birthday party. Even though Gabrielle's comment was aimed at Elisa, it wouldn't sound good if others heard it.

Gabrielle decided not to argue further and walked away.

Elisa didn't want to follow Gabrielle, so she took Christina another way. By the time they reached the living room, everyone else had already arrived.

Nicholas was still in the garden exercising and hadn't come in yet.

The living room was spacious, with several large tables set up by the butler, filled with juices, wines, and various snacks.

"Nicholas will be here shortly. Please wait a moment. If you need anything, just let me know," the butler said before standing aside.

Everyone exchanged glances and made small talk, each with their own thoughts.

On such an occasion, who wouldn't want to make a good impression on Nicholas?

Christina didn't want to join their conversation and kept looking at her phone. When she looked up, she accidentally made eye contact with William.

She quickly looked away.

What bad luck.

Soon, Nicholas arrived. Despite his age, his presence was still commanding as he sat down.

"Happy birthday, Nicholas," Gabrielle was the first to stand up, raising her glass of juice.

She drank it in one go and then presented a box. "This is a gemstone brooch I acquired at an auction abroad. It matches the one you have."

Nicholas opened the box to find a brooch set with sapphires and turquoise, clearly to his liking.

He nodded in satisfaction and handed the box to the butler. "Gabrielle, you are very thoughtful."

With Gabrielle setting the example, others quickly presented their gifts.

Elisa remained seated. If she couldn't go first, she would go last.

After everyone had given their gifts, she finally stood up and presented a landscape painting. "Nicholas, this is my heartfelt gift."

"Very nice. It will look perfect in my study," Nicholas nodded approvingly.

The butler moved to take the painting, but Elisa stopped him. "Nicholas, this painting is missing one final touch."

Curious eyes turned to her.

Gabrielle scoffed. Bringing an unfinished painting? What was she thinking?

Did she plan to have the artist come and finish it in front of everyone? Ridiculous.

Elisa was clearly trying too hard to impress men. No one should expect much from her.

"Christina, come here," Elisa called to her daughter.

Christina took out a paintbrush from her bag and added a few strokes of golden sunlight to the painting, bringing it to life.

Her style was both controlled and expressive, perfectly blending strength and beauty. The sunlight symbolized hope and warmth, which pleased Nicholas greatly.

"Excellent, very well done," Nicholas nodded in approval.

The painting was already good, but the addition of sunlight gave it a special touch.

"Who would have thought Christina, at such a young age, could paint so well? Raymond, you've raised a fine daughter," Nicholas praised, prompting others to chime in.

William watched the scene unfold. Though he didn't like Christina, he had to admit her addition to the painting was impressive.

But when did Christina learn to paint?

What else didn't he know about her?

Listening to the compliments, Elisa felt immensely satisfied. Her meticulous planning had paid off.

###chapter 65   Why Are You Seducing My Son?

So many people came to the birthday party today, and everyone brought gifts, but in the end, it was her gift that stood out.

In front of Nicholas, Elisa certainly didn't dare to show her pride.

She modestly said, "Oh, it's nothing, Nicholas. You're too kind."

"Your attitude is wrong. A painting best reflects a person's spirit and energy. If Christina can paint so well, she must be exceptional," Nicholas praised again.

Elisa quickly agreed, "You're right, Nicholas."

Gabrielle watched from the side, her face darkening.

If it weren't for the crowd, she would have loved to throw in some sarcastic remarks.

Elisa's background was quite ordinary, and her narrow-mindedness was obvious. She was clearly very pleased with herself but pretended to be indifferent.

She could pretend all she wanted, but she wasn't even good at it.

It was truly laughable!

And Christina, with just a few strokes, what could that show?

Who judges painting skills based on a few strokes?

If it weren't Nicholas saying this, Gabrielle would have mocked the person mercilessly.

"Today is a family gathering, let's enjoy ourselves and not worry too much about rules. Try the food and see if you like it," Nicholas said, picking up his fork.

He speared the steak in front of him and took a bite, the juices bursting in his mouth, filling it with flavor.

Everyone else followed suit, picking up their forks.

After a few rounds of drinks, Nicholas had some business to attend to and took William to the study, leaving the others to continue eating and drinking at the table.

With Nicholas gone, the atmosphere at the table wasn't as harmonious.

Gabrielle kept glaring at Elisa.

Christina didn't care about any of this. She just focused on getting food for herself. When she was almost done eating, she reached for a drink.

But the drink was a bit far, and her arm wasn't long enough. She tried but couldn't reach it.

Walter handed her the drink, and Christina smiled at him, mouthing a thank you.

This was a small, trivial act, but to Gabrielle, it was something else entirely.

With Nicholas gone, she had no reservations.

She slammed the table and stood up, glaring at Christina, "You're young and already up to no good, just like your mother, always trying to seduce men."

"What nonsense are you spouting?" Elisa was furious.

Gabrielle had been snide to her since they got out of the car, and now she was publicly insulting her daughter.

This was no different from insulting her directly!

Raymond didn't want them to cause a scene and gave Elisa a look.

Elisa, though unwilling, decided not to say anything more.

Gabrielle sneered, "I saw it with my own eyes, clear as day. How is that nonsense? Your daughter first tried to seduce William, and when that didn't work, she turned to my son. What, is my son a trash can? Taking in what others don't want?"

"When you're looking for a son-in-law, you should consider not just the man's qualities but also your daughter's character. Let me make it clear, Walter's wife must be of good character, especially not someone with a mother and daughter both lacking morals. Our family can't afford such disgraceful people!"

Gabrielle's words left no room for Elisa and her family.

Christina looked at the drink in her hand and then at Gabrielle, finding it utterly ridiculous. "He just handed me a drink because I couldn't reach it. How did that become something so dirty in your mouth?"

"Because you have a history, and your mother is no better. Shouldn't I be cautious? Today it's a drink, tomorrow you'll be in bed together," Gabrielle retorted.

Christina was amazed by her twisted logic.

By her reasoning, it was a miracle Walter had made it this far. Helping with a drink was seduction, leading to sex. So, talking to him must have the same intent?

Walter himself felt extremely embarrassed.

He lowered his voice to Gabrielle, "Mom, it's Grandpa's birthday party. Don't make a scene. Everyone's watching, and you'll make us a laughingstock."

"You've grown older but not wiser. You're being fooled by Christina," Gabrielle said, frustrated. "Look, just over a drink, you're already defending her."

"Mom, it's not what you think. We're practically family. I see her as a sister."

"What kind of family? There's no blood relation," Gabrielle pointed out.

Everyone knew Christina was brought into the Cavendish family by Elisa.

She was nominally Raymond's daughter, but who knew who her real father was?

"And she is related to William, but look how that turned out. With that precedent, I can't underestimate her."

Even Christina's good temper couldn't take it anymore.

She had done nothing wrong, yet she had to endure Gabrielle's blatant hostility. It was completely unfair.

She was about to speak when a cold voice interrupted, "What's going on? Why is it so noisy?"

It was William.

Though he was younger, he was highly regarded by Nicholas, so no one dared to act out in front of him.

Seeing him, Gabrielle toned down a bit, though her face was still sour. "Today is Dad's birthday party. We're all here to celebrate, but some people are using this opportunity to seduce Walter."

Gabrielle didn't name names, but her gaze was fixed on Christina, making her meaning clear.

William looked over, "Why are you causing trouble?"

It had been peaceful when he was there, but as soon as he and his grandfather left, Christina was in trouble again.

If he hadn't returned in time, who knew how bad it would have gotten?

"It's not me causing trouble, but some people being overly suspicious. There's a camera in the living room. We can check the footage to see what really happened. If it's my fault, I'll admit it. If not, no one can falsely accuse me."

Christina stood tall and firm.

She was the type who wouldn't admit to something she didn't do. She couldn't do that.

###chapter 66 Reprimanding Gabrielle

"You're just making excuses," Gabrielle snapped, her eyes narrowing at Christina.

Seriously, what kind of attitude was Christina showing? She was still an elder, after all.

And she thought she could become Gabrielle's daughter-in-law with that behavior? What a joke.

Whoever ends up marrying Christina would be in for a nightmare, having their household turned upside down.

William called the butler over. "Check the living room's surveillance footage and send it to me right away."

"Yes, sir. I'll get on it," the butler responded promptly.

After reviewing the footage, Nicholas came down from his study.

He took his seat at the head of the table, immediately sensing the tension in the room. "What's going on here?"

In front of Nicholas, Gabrielle didn't dare make a sound.

Even if Christina had been trying to seduce her son, today was Nicholas's birthday party. If she caused a scene in front of him, who knew if Nicholas might take his anger out on her.

William projected the surveillance footage. It clearly showed Christina reaching for a drink without speaking to anyone.

Instead, it was Walter who handed her the drink, and Christina smiled in thanks. There was nothing inappropriate between them.

The video proved Christina's innocence.

Nicholas, still unclear on the situation, watched as Gabrielle in the video slammed the table and accused Christina of seducing her son.

Nicholas's face darkened. "Gabrielle, what are you doing? Even if they were strangers, isn't it normal to help pass a drink?"

Thankfully, it was a family gathering with only the Cavendish family present. If there had been other guests, the family's reputation would have been ruined.

"Nicholas, I..."

"Look at the mess you've caused today. Enough. As an elder, you should know better than to make such a scene," Nicholas said, not softening his tone.

Gabrielle sat down quietly, not daring to make a sound.

With the issue resolved, Christina didn't push further and took her seat.

Elisa, mindful of Nicholas's presence, sent Christina a text: [Stay away from Walter from now on.]

Christina understood this well enough without being told.

Walter was a decent guy and treated her well, but his overbearing mother was a problem.

After today's fiasco, Christina didn't want a repeat.

As Christina was about to reply with an emoji, Elisa sent another message: [If you had prepared properly for the date I set up, today's incident wouldn't have happened.]

[What does that have to do with the date?] Christina sometimes couldn't understand Elisa's logic.

Gabrielle's outburst today had two reasons: she disliked Elisa and she disliked Christina.

Whether Christina was dating, married, or single, Gabrielle would always see her as a troublemaker.

The guy from the last date, even though Christina had only seen him briefly, had this look in his eyes that made her feel sick to her stomach.

If she had to spend her life with a man like that, living together and even having a child, it would be a fate worse than death. She'd rather end her life than endure such torment.

[How does it not matter? If you had hit it off and set a wedding date, Gabrielle wouldn't dare bother you. You'd have a man to back you up.] Elisa sent a long message.

Christina felt a deep sadness.

Why should a woman have to rely on a man for support and protection?

If men were so reliable, there wouldn't be so many suffering women in the world.

But she didn't want to argue with Elisa.

Elisa's mindset was fixed, and no amount of reasoning would change it.

Christina decided to focus on her own life.

She would never cooperate with Elisa's matchmaking, rejecting every suitor.

The family dinner ended, and everyone began to leave.

Gabrielle pulled Walter aside quickly, emphasizing, "Walter, you can negotiate on other things, but you must listen to me on this. Stay away from Christina. If she latches onto you, you'll never shake her off."

"Mom, why are you so biased against her? We're just friends, nothing inappropriate," Walter felt she was overreacting.

Nicholas accepted Christina, making her part of the Cavendish family.

Even if Gabrielle disliked her, she shouldn't be so obvious about it.

"Walter, are you listening to me?" Gabrielle stopped, her expression serious.

Walter nodded, agreeing just to appease her.

Satisfied with his promise, Gabrielle changed the subject.

Meanwhile, Christina was tired of Elisa's nagging about dates. She found an excuse, "I have plans to see a movie with a friend, so I won't be going home. You guys go ahead."

"Which friend? A guy or a girl?" Elisa wanted more details.

Raymond intervened, "She's an adult with her own friends and life. We shouldn't interfere too much."

Elisa finally dropped the subject.

After parting ways, Christina left the Cavendish Mansion, feeling relieved that the social obligations were over.

She wanted to hail a cab and enjoy some freedom.

Suddenly, a car pulled up beside her. The window rolled down, revealing William's face. "Get in."

"I've already called a cab. I don't need a ride," Christina's first instinct was to refuse.

She wanted to stay as far away from William as possible.

But William didn't budge. He gave her a cold look, "Do I need to get out and drag you in?"

He was the type to follow through on his threats. If he forcibly pulled her into the car, it would be embarrassing.

And they were right outside the Cavendish Mansion. If anyone saw, it would only fuel more gossip.

###chapter 67  You Are the First to Dare to Treat Me as a Driver.

But if she got in the car like this, Christina had no idea where William planned to take her.

She couldn't just follow him blindly without knowing anything!

Seeing her standing still, William's face grew colder. He reached out to push the car door open.

"Don't get out, I'll get in," Christina finally chose to compromise.

Just now, because of Walter, she had already become the talk of the entire Cavendish family. Now, with William added to the mix, two men and one woman, she could easily imagine how explosive the gossip would be.

William might be shameless, but she wasn't.

She opened the back door, got in, fastened her seatbelt, and waited for a while. Seeing that William had no intention of driving, she couldn't help but ask, "Where are you taking me?"

They couldn't just sit in the car forever.

"Christina, you're the first person to treat me like a chauffeur," William said, unsure if she was pretending to be clueless or genuinely was.

She had gotten in and sat directly behind the driver's seat. Was she planning to give him orders next?

Christina was speechless.

It was just a seat, how could she have known William would be so particular?

She had no choice but to unbuckle her seatbelt, get out, and then sit in the front passenger seat. After fastening her seatbelt again, she asked, "Is this better? Where are you taking me?"

"You'll know when we get there," William said, stepping on the gas and driving forward.

Since he wasn't willing to say now, Christina decided not to ask further.

They both remained silent during the drive, with only the sound of music filling the car.

Half an hour later, William parked outside a hotel. "There's an auction at the hotel today. I need to buy something for my grandfather. You're coming with me."

Christina didn't say a word.

She got out and followed him, feeling a wave of irritation as she watched his back.

If he wanted to buy something for his grandfather, he could have come by himself. Why drag her along?

If it weren't for the fact that William had helped her by checking the surveillance footage at the family dinner, she would have turned around and left, rather than cooperating with him like this.

The auction was on the top floor of the hotel. They took the elevator up and were led to a reserved private room by a staff member.

There were quite a few people attending the auction, and the hotel provided free drinks and snacks.

Christina had been a bit thirsty at the Cavendish Mansion. Although Walter had brought her a drink, Gabrielle's outburst had prevented her from touching it.

Seeing the self-serve drink station outside, she stood up. "I'm going to get a drink. I'll be right back."

William nodded slightly, saying nothing.

He wasn't so harsh as to deny Christina a drink.

While getting her drink, Christina spotted an old acquaintance, Zachary, her previous date.

Recalling that unpleasant experience, Christina wanted to hurry back after getting her drink.

But Zachary noticed her.

Seeing her outfit today, Zachary's eyes lit up. Although Christina had a messy personal life and a bad reputation, she could still make a good mistress.

Look at that face and that figure. Given her past experiences, she must have plenty of tricks in bed. Just thinking about it made Zachary aroused.

He strode over, blocking Christina's path, and reached out to shake her hand. "Ms. Windsor, we must be fated to meet again here, and you look stunning today."

His gaze was sticky and lecherous, making Christina very uncomfortable.

She put her hand behind her back and took a step back, not wanting any physical contact with him.

Her tone was cold, "How I dress is none of your business."

"We had a bit of a disagreement on our date, but if we can't be a couple, can't we at least be friends? There are many pieces of jewelry at the auction today. If you see something you like, just let me know, and I'll buy it for you," Zachary tried to win Christina over with money.

He had plenty of money, and any problem that could be solved with money was no problem for him.

Women Christina's age, still in school and without an income, needed money the most.

Zachary thought Christina would come running to him after his offer, but she remained indifferent. "No need. I'll buy what I want myself."

If she couldn't afford it, she wouldn't buy it.

She hadn't fallen so low as to trade sex for jewelry. Even if she got it, it would feel dirty.

"Ms. Windsor, we've met twice now. We're old acquaintances. You don't need to be so distant or polite. Just tell me what you want, and I'll get it for you," Zachary thought Christina was playing hard to get.

Her mother was eager to marry her off, so she must be easy to win over.

Christina thought he was out of his mind and impossible to communicate with.

Now that she had her drink, she ignored Zachary and turned to walk back to William.

Zachary was furious.

He didn't respect women like Christina. He just wanted to play with her. Now, after approaching her with a smile, all he got was her cold face. Who could tolerate that?

He angrily chased after Christina, grabbing her wrist. His tone was no longer gentle but threatening, "Ms. Windsor, playing hard to get has its limits. Cross that line, and it backfires."

"Who's playing hard to get with you? If you're sick, go to a mental hospital. Don't act crazy here," Christina instinctively tried to pull her hand away.

But Zachary's grip was too tight. He was using all five fingers, and she couldn't break free.

"Fuck, who are you pretending to be?" Zachary was now completely enraged.

Pointing a finger at Christina's nose, he cursed, "You're not a virgin, so stop pretending to be a good woman. Women like you are just for money. I'm not refusing to pay. Name your price, and I'll transfer the money right now."

He was determined to use money to crush Christina today.

###chapter 68 She is a Member of the Cavendish Family

Christina finally got what he was hinting at.

Did he seriously want her to be his mistress?

What a joke. Even if she was desperate for cash and needed a man to support her, she'd definitely go for William.

Sure, William could be a pain, but at least he was good-looking, not much older than her, and loaded.

But Zachary?

Just the sight of his bulging belly made Christina lose any interest, not to mention his pockmarked face. Kissing him would make her want to puke.

She was utterly disgusted. "I'm telling you again, back off. This isn't a place where you can do whatever you want. Let go of me right now!"

Zachary didn't care at all.

So what if he held her hand? Even if he forced himself on Christina, what could she do?

Christina's biological mother was thrilled with him as a son-in-law. At worst, he'd marry Christina first, and after a few months, when he got bored, he'd find an excuse to divorce her.

People would just say Christina wasn't good enough to keep a man.

With this in mind, Zachary not only didn't let go but also used his other hand to touch Christina's skin.

Smooth and delicate, it felt really good.

Christina couldn't take it anymore. She threw her hot coffee right in Zachary's face.

The intense burning sensation made Zachary scream in pain, and he let go of Christina's arm.

He didn't even bother to grab a napkin, using his jacket to wipe the coffee off his face, looking utterly pathetic.

All thanks to Christina.

He glared at her, wishing he could kill her right then and there, spewing the nastiest words he could think of.

"You were sleeping around at sixteen, who knows how many abortions you've had. You're damaged goods. You should be grateful I even look at you. What other man would want you?"

People around them were drawn by the commotion and started looking over.

Christina was shaking with anger. Zachary was even more disgusting than she had imagined, and this was the man her mother wanted to set her up with.

Even if she refused, Elisa would find another opportunity to scold her.

Today was really unlucky for her. First Gabrielle, now Zachary.

"This suit is custom-made and very expensive. You stained my clothes, so you have to pay for it. If you can't afford it, you'll have to compensate me with yourself," Zachary exaggerated the price of his suit.

After all, Christina was just a student. How much money could a student have?

If her parents really cared about her, they wouldn't push her into dating before she even graduated.

"I'll pay for the clothes, but you harassed me and damaged my reputation. I'll hold you accountable for that," Christina said, looking around the hall.

There were surveillance cameras here, and Zachary's actions had been recorded. She could use the footage to hold him accountable.

Zachary didn't take her words seriously.

He could just bribe the hotel staff to delete the video. What could Christina do then?

Just as he thought he had Christina cornered, William strode over and kicked him in the knee.

With a sharp crack, Zachary fell to his knees!

He gritted his teeth in anger. "Who the hell dares to kick me..."

But when he saw William's face, he stopped mid-sentence.

It was William, the heir groomed by Nicholas, the future CEO of the Cavendish Corporation.

Behind him was the entire Cavendish family.

No matter how arrogant Zachary was, he wouldn't dare mess with William.

"What do you want to say?" William looked down at him.

Zachary winced in pain but didn't dare show it. He forced a smile. "Nothing, Mr. Cavendish. I didn't know you were here. If I had known, I wouldn't have caused such a scene."

"Really?" William's smile was cold.

Those who knew him well knew he was already angry.

Zachary nodded frantically, still trying to shift the blame to Christina. "Yes, she threw coffee at me. I was just really mad."

"And why did she throw coffee at you?"

"Because she was trying to seduce me and raise her price. I didn't agree, so..." Zachary trailed off.

His face turned pale, eyes full of disbelief.

Someone tell him why Christina was standing next to William?

And why wasn't William telling her to get lost? Did this mean Christina was with William today?

Zachary's face turned ashen.

William's expression grew darker. "Do you think the Cavendish family would ever need to beg the Bennett family for money?"

"No, no, of course not. I was just talking nonsense. Please don't hold it against me. I'll leave right away." Zachary slapped himself twice.

He didn't care about anything else now, just wanting to leave as quickly as possible, afraid that if he lingered, William would remember him.

The onlookers shifted their focus from Christina to Zachary, criticizing him for being so foolish and daring to mess with the Cavendish family.

"Thank you," Christina whispered.

If William hadn't shown up, Zachary would have continued to harass her. He wouldn't have left so quickly.

William didn't respond, turning to walk towards the private room.

Christina quickly followed.

Once the door was closed, William turned to her. "What are you doing every day? As a student, you should be focusing on your studies, not getting involved with these kinds of people!"

Christina was about to speak when William added, "Don't give me any victim-blaming nonsense. If you two had never met before, he wouldn't have spoken to you like that. You better tell me the truth, or I'll find out myself."

With his resources, investigating this would be a piece of cake.

Christina knew there was no point in hiding it. Besides, there was nothing to hide.

She told William directly, "Zachary is my date. We met once at the hospital."

"What?" William's brows furrowed.

He almost thought he misheard. Christina was so young, and she was already dating?

###chapter 69 Don't Play Tricks on Me

His first reaction was that Christina was lying, trying to deceive him. "Come on, be straight with me. Don't mess around. If I have to dig into this myself, not only will I find out, but Grandpa will too."

Nicholas had let her off the hook for the last incident, but if Zachary got involved and connected the dots, Christina might really get kicked out of the Cavendish family.

Christina knew this all too well. "But I'm telling you the truth now. If you don't believe me, what can I do? If you really want to check, go ahead."

No matter how much he investigated, he'd find the same answer she was giving him.

William saw that she didn't seem to be lying and kept pushing, "Who set up the date for you?"

"Of course, it was my mom. Do you think I'd set up a date for myself?" Christina gave him a puzzled look.

Sometimes she really didn't get what William was thinking.

Since this involved Elisa, William didn't push further. He gave a final warning, "I'll handle Zachary. Just try not to cause any more trouble for the Cavendish family. You might not care about your reputation, but the Cavendish family does."

"Wait, how did this become my problem again?" Christina was exasperated.

He always told her not to blame the victim, but his actions were the epitome of that very mindset.

But considering William had helped her solve two problems today, she decided to let it go.

Christina took a deep breath, turned her head away, and didn't want to deal with William anymore.

They were here on a mission today. William had something to bid on, and once he was done, she could leave.

She'd rather go back to school than see William's face or talk to him any longer.

William was after a particular painting, and it just so happened to be the first item up for auction.

Not wanting to waste time, he immediately bid the highest price.

The room fell silent for a moment, then a few scattered bids came in, but none were very high.

William was determined to get the painting. He matched every bid until he successfully won it.

Christina watched, thinking how great it must be to have money. With money, you have choices. She wished her life could be like that.

Soon, the staff brought over the painting, and William paid with his card.

"You got what you wanted. Can we leave now?" Christina couldn't help but urge.

She really didn't want to be in the same room as William any longer.

William noticed her attitude but didn't see why he should let her have her way.

Without even looking at her, he refused, "No, I have other items to look at."

"But you just told me Nicholas wanted you to get one thing, and you already did. Why do you need to look at other items?" Christina felt he was deliberately wasting her time.

She wasn't his assistant, free to spend all her time on him. She had her own things to do. "Or I could leave now, and you can stay as long as you want. That's your business, not mine."

William finally gave her a look. "I just helped you out with a problem, and now you want to bail? Even if you want to be ungrateful, this is too fast, Christina. Where's your conscience?"

"Please, if you hadn't dragged me here, I wouldn't have run into Zachary or had any of this happen."

If they really argued about it, who knew if William had helped her or caused her more trouble?

"Zachary has his eye on you now. Even if you hadn't met today, do you think he wouldn't cause you trouble later?" William countered.

Christina had to admit, even if she didn't like William, he had a point.

Zachary clearly had his sights set on her.

Fine, she was already here, so it didn't matter how long she stayed.

The auction continued with many more items, but Christina didn't pay attention. William wasn't interested in them either.

He asked Christina, "Why are you so eager to avoid me? If you can give me a satisfactory answer, I'll let you go now."

Christina didn't respond.

Reincarnation was something no one would believe, and William might think she was crazy and needed psychiatric help.

She decided to wait until the auction ended.

Facing William, she made up an answer, "There's no particular reason. I used to find you agreeable, but now I don't. Just like with Walter, I used to think he was nice, but now I keep my distance."

"You're lying," William said confidently.

He was good at reading people, especially since he and Christina had been intimate.

He could tell.

Christina shrugged, giving up, "You asked, I answered, and you don't believe me. What can I do?"

She'd just wait until the auction ended.

There weren't many items today, so it would be over in two hours at most. By then, William would have no reason to keep her.

William had his doubts but got no answers.

After the auction, he took the painting and left the hotel with Christina.

"I want to go back to school. You don't need to drive me. I'll take a cab," Christina said eagerly, wanting to distance herself from him.

She found an excuse, "There are so many people at school, and you drive a fancy car. If you stop at the gate, everyone will look, and it might end up on Facebook. I don't want any more rumors about us."

"Fine," William agreed with a nod.

Christina quickly hailed a cab.

There was a mall nearby, so there were plenty of people and taxis. A driver arrived soon.

Once in the cab, Christina leaned back and checked the time. It was late, and she was exhausted.

If she went back to the mansion tonight, she'd see William again.

She decided to stay in the dorm, order takeout, take a shower, and sleep. The dorm was cramped but at least it was free.

As for whether William would agree...

By the time the dorms were locked, what could he do? He wouldn't come upstairs to get her!

###chapter 70 I Will Personally Make One for You Then

Christina weighed the pros and cons and decided to head back to the architecture department. After all, she was part of the team, and it was just for one night.

She didn't expect the next day to be a mountain of work. After finally finishing, she thought she could relax a bit.

Kaitlyn walked over in a pink dress, looking adorable and sweet. She immediately linked arms with Christina and greeted her warmly, "Christina, you're done for the day?"

"I've been working on design plans all day, I'm exhausted. Are you here to see Mr. Fisher?" Christina asked, puzzled.

"Of course not!" Kaitlyn pouted. "What's the fun in hanging out with him? He's always lecturing. I'm here to see you. Let's go shopping."

"Shopping?" Christina was taken aback and instinctively refused, "I still have work to do."

"Don't give me that!" Kaitlyn stood up straight, her eyes fixed on Christina. "I checked before coming here. You've finished all your work. You have to come with me!"

Christina couldn't say no to her. She wasn't used to someone so lively and straightforward, making it hard to refuse.

"Alright, alright, I'll go with you," Christina surrendered.

Kaitlyn chose Celestial Emporium, a high-end place with many private designs and international brands. It was dazzling.

Kaitlyn held up a dress. "Christina, what do you think of this one?"

"It's beautiful," Christina praised. "It should suit your figure well."

Kaitlyn pouted, "The design is nice, but the color is awful. It's gray."

A sales associate, hearing this, approached with a smile. "Miss, this dress is called 'Starry Night.'"

"A dress has a name?" Kaitlyn raised an eyebrow.

The sales associate nodded.

Kaitlyn wasn't interested in the story behind the dress and asked, "Do you have other colors? Like red, yellow, or even blue?"

The sales associate shook her head with a smile. "Sorry, Miss. This dress only comes in gray. The design is inspired by the Milky Way, with a silver-gray base that sparkles under the light, like a starry sky."

Kaitlyn shrugged, uninterested in gray, and turned to look at other clothes.

In the center of the store, a glass case displayed a stunning, elegant gown. Christina was reminded of a dress she had designed in her past life. Though she never finished it, she was proud of it. Unfortunately, the design was never completed due to various reasons.

The sales associate noticed Christina's interest and approached. "This is our signature piece. If you're interested, I can tell you more about it."

"No, thank you. I'm just looking," Christina replied politely.

The sales associate wisely stepped back.

In her past life, Christina had been caught up in so many things that she had forgotten her dreams. The dress design she had worked on for three years before losing Harper was never finished, despite the effort she put into it.

Christina drifted into thought.

Kaitlyn called her several times, and when she didn't respond, Kaitlyn jumped in front of her, waving a hand in her face. "Christina, what are you thinking about?"

Christina snapped back to reality and smiled faintly. "Nothing much. What's up?"

Kaitlyn held up a bright red dress. "How about this one?"

The dress, which might look gaudy on someone else, looked stunning on Kaitlyn. The well-tailored red dress highlighted her figure, and her fair skin made her look even more beautiful.

"It's gorgeous," Christina said honestly.

Kaitlyn pouted. "Christina, you sound like a boring guy."

Christina felt a bit embarrassed.

Kaitlyn laughed. "Alright, enough teasing. What were you thinking about so deeply?"

Christina didn't answer. It was just a fleeting thought.

But Kaitlyn seemed to catch on. "You wouldn't happen to know fashion design, would you? You looked like you were admiring a great piece of work."

Christina didn't hide it and nodded. "Yes, I studied fashion design on my own for a while and made a few designs. I just never had the chance to prove myself."

She thought about how pathetic her life had been, always mediocre. But now, given a second chance, she was determined to complete what she hadn't before.

Kaitlyn's eyes sparkled. "That's easy."

"You have a way?" Christina looked at her.

"Of course," Kaitlyn said proudly. "I happen to know someone at Velvet Mirage. Maybe you two could collaborate."

"Really?" Christina was surprised at the opportunity. She hadn't expected her casual remark to lead to such a chance.

Kaitlyn nodded enthusiastically and leaned in. "But Christina, if I help you with this, how will you thank me?"

Christina thought for a moment. "I'll design a unique dress just for you. How about that?"

"That sounds fair," Kaitlyn agreed. She lost interest in shopping and grabbed Christina's hand. "Let's go visit her now!"

"So suddenly?" Christina was taken aback by Kaitlyn's impulsive nature.

"You want it, I want it, it's not sudden," Kaitlyn said, paying for the dress at the counter and wearing it out.

Christina wasn't shy, but she didn't expect Kaitlyn to be in such a hurry. She teased, "Aren't you afraid I'll mess up and embarrass you in front of your friend?"

"Don't worry about it," Kaitlyn said, pulling her along.

Velvet Mirage's office wasn't far from the fashion district. They walked for about ten minutes to get there.

Without an appointment, they were stopped at the front desk.

Kaitlyn smiled confidently. "Tell them Kaitlyn is here. I know your boss. She'll let me in."

The receptionist quickly made a call to confirm.

Kaitlyn turned to Christina. "I just realized, do you have any of your old designs on your phone? You could show them to her. She might be impressed."

###chapter 71: What Do You Mean?

"There are a few, but they're all designs I did a while back. I'm not really happy with them," Christina said, shaking her head.

"Don't sweat it, Ava Davis is super chill," Kaitlyn reassured her, patting her hand. "Plus, you've got me here with you."

Christina couldn't help but laugh at Kaitlyn's serious expression.

"Why do you look like a mom dropping her kid off at school?"

Kaitlyn puffed up with pride, crossing her arms and lifting her chin. "That's right, I'm your go-between and now your guardian. You better listen to me."

"Cut it out!" Christina laughed, shaking her head in exasperation.

Kaitlyn pouted. "I helped you out big time today, and you don't even try to make me happy."

"Alright, alright," Christina nodded along with her.

Just then, the receptionist confirmed their appointment. "Ms. Ava Davis is expecting you. You can go right up."

"Thanks," Kaitlyn flashed a bright smile and led Christina upstairs.

No wonder this city is a fashion capital, Christina thought as they passed by various posters showcasing bold and innovative designs that celebrated women's beauty.

They reached the office and knocked before entering. On the sofa facing the door sat a stylish woman with short hair, striking makeup, and eye-catching accessories. She exuded a polished and professional aura.

Another person was seated on the sofa, but only their back was visible, long hair cascading over their shoulders.

Kaitlyn greeted them, "You have a guest?"

"No worries, come on in," Ava waved them over nonchalantly.

The two quickly stepped inside.

Kaitlyn, always direct, got straight to the point. "I brought you a designer to check out. What do you think?"

"This one? Kaitlyn, you rarely get involved in these matters. She must be something special," Ava said politely.

At that moment, the guest on the sofa turned around, intrigued by the conversation. Their eyes met, and they recognized each other instantly.

"Jennifer!"

"Christina?"

Of all places, Christina thought, she had to run into Jennifer here.

Jennifer frowned, staring at her. "What are you doing here?"

Christina smiled calmly. "I'm here with my friend. Is that a problem?"

Jennifer pressed her lips together. "No."

Ava seemed to pick up on the tension between them, her expression shifting as she pieced things together.

"So, this is the Christina you've mentioned? Seeing is believing," Ava's tone grew more nuanced.

Christina didn't need to think hard to know that Jennifer wouldn't have anything nice to say about her. Given their close relationship, Jennifer had probably already badmouthed her.

Ava pulled Kaitlyn aside. "Kaitlyn, you haven't been out in the world much. Not everyone is worth befriending. She might just be using you."

Kaitlyn, though straightforward, wasn't naive. She pouted. "I know how to tell right from wrong."

"Good. I didn't mean to overstep, just a friendly reminder. If I said anything unpleasant, don't take it to heart," Ava said with a smile.

Ava was perceptive and could tell Kaitlyn was unhappy, so she didn't push further. She sipped her coffee.

"Our studio doesn't take just anyone. Some people only know how to curry favor with the powerful, not focusing on their craft. Bringing them in would be pointless."

Jennifer, sensing Ava was defending her, looked smugly at Christina.

Christina saw Kaitlyn about to speak up for her and gently held her back, smiling faintly.

"I've heard a lot about Velvet Mirage. It's highly respected, but now it seems overrated."

Ava's face darkened, her hand pausing mid-air with the coffee cup. "What do you mean?"

Christina smiled calmly. "Judging someone without knowing them, based on your assumptions, doesn't reflect well on your studio."

"Is this how you ask for help?" Jennifer frowned.

"It seems you're not interested in my designs. Let's not waste time," Christina said firmly.

Kaitlyn quickly intervened. "We're all friends here. Let's not make things awkward. Ava, let's sit down and talk calmly. You might find a great collaborator."

Ava huffed. "I just want to see if she's all talk or has real talent. I'm not convinced about a partnership yet."

"Then take a look, Christina. Isn't this your dream? Don't let some spiteful words deter you," Kaitlyn said, glaring at Jennifer.

Jennifer's face turned red, but she wouldn't back down. "Watch your mouth. Christina's attitude isn't exactly asking for help."

"Did I name names? Why are you so defensive? Feeling guilty?" Kaitlyn retorted sharply.

Jennifer bit her lip, unable to find a comeback.

Ava, caught between her friends, decided to de-escalate. "Let's see if she has real talent."

Christina, seeing how much Kaitlyn had done for her, couldn't just walk away. She took out her old design sketches.

"These are from when I was less experienced. They might be a bit rough."

Ava's eyes widened as she looked at the designs, clearly impressed.

Jennifer leaned in to look, frowning after a while. "Christina, don't deceive yourself. The design world isn't a playground for fame."

###chapter 72 The Price is Basically This

Her words were serious, and everyone turned to Jennifer, waiting for her to explain.

Jennifer pointed to a design sketch and raised her voice.

"This design won the gold medal at the Young Designers Competition three years ago. It was later bought by a private buyer overseas. It's not super famous, but people remember it."

She pulled out her phone and searched for the news from back then.

Sure enough, they found a blurry image of the original design in the news, and it was almost identical to the sketch.

"You're always trying to scam people!" Jennifer said coldly, frowning.

Ava looked up and asked, "What does this mean?"

She had thought she had found a rare talent, but now it seemed there was a suspicion of plagiarism. Such a scandal would be a big deal in the design world.

Christina calmly asked, "How can you be so sure this design isn't mine?"

"How could it be?" Jennifer's confidence wavered.

If Jennifer hadn't brought it up, she would have almost forgotten that this design had won an award. After all, with memories from both her past and present lives, many details had faded over time.

Although she had forgotten, proving it wasn't difficult.

After the proof was presented, even Ava showed a look of admiration. "I guess I underestimated you. Your design is impressive. How about we discuss a collaboration?"

Kaitlyn, worried that the earlier tension might cause issues, decided to clear the air.

"Ava, you were just criticizing her."

"I was too hasty!" Ava smiled apologetically. "I won't judge by appearances again."

"I was too aggressive in my words," Christina also showed her sincerity without hesitation.

All the discord vanished in that moment.

"Why don't we talk about the collaboration?" Ava suggested.

"Sure," Christina agreed with a nod.

Seeing them start to get along, Kaitlyn felt relieved and, noticing her own empty stomach, made a suggestion.

"What's the point of talking here? Let's go to a restaurant. We just got off work and haven't eaten yet."

Ava thought it was a great idea and nodded. "We haven't eaten either. There's a nice restaurant nearby."

"Whatever you say," Christina smiled and nodded.

Jennifer, seeing their friendly interaction, felt a twinge of displeasure.

Ava noticed Jennifer was still there and casually invited her along.

They went to an upscale club that ensured privacy and had a professional chef, making it perfect for business dinners.

Once seated, they began chatting and laughing.

Ava was eager to collaborate. "What kind of partnership are you thinking of?"

"I'd like to collaborate by sharing the design profits," Christina had thought it through.

"I work at an architecture firm, which is my main job, but I also do some fashion design. After deducting costs, I'd like to share the remaining profits with your studio."

Ava thought for a moment, finding the terms a bit strict.

"Usually, we buy the designs outright. Besides, you're not part of Velvet Mirage, so profit-sharing seems unstable."

She was concerned about the high risk involved.

"I get where you're coming from. Kaitlyn's my friend, and she brought me this opportunity. I'm really grateful," Christina said with a smile.

She implied that the collaboration would be stable because a friend was involved.

After thinking for a moment, Ava nodded slightly. "Alright, since you'll be sharing the risk, let's do it."

"Let's discuss the profit-sharing details," Christina raised her coffee cup for a toast.

"Seventy-thirty, that's the usual rate," Ava said decisively.

"Since I'm taking on the risk, isn't my share too small?" Christina raised an eyebrow. "Fifty-fifty, after deducting costs, is already quite low."

Ava hesitated, knowing that deducting costs meant guaranteed profit.

Kaitlyn chimed in, "Ava, think it over. My friend is very talented and can take your business to the next level."

After a long hesitation, Ava seemed to make a decision.

"You've thought it through well. What else can I say? Let's do it. I'll have our legal department draft a contract, and we can sign it soon."

"No problem. I'll toast to our collaboration with coffee," Christina stood up and gracefully raised her coffee cup.

They were all women, so they didn't stick to traditional drinking customs. They enjoyed their drinks and food, chatting and laughing.

"I'll be right back," Christina said to Kaitlyn, seeing Ava and Jennifer talking, and headed towards the door.

Jennifer watched her leave, raising an eyebrow slightly.

With the collaboration settled, Jennifer felt there was nothing more to say.

In the next room, William was chatting with a friend when the friend suddenly clapped.

A group of beautiful women entered, sitting next to William as if they were old friends.

"Mr. Cavendish, let me pour you a drink."

"What's this?" William frowned.

His friend smiled. "It's a special service here. They're just here to serve you. With your experience, why worry?"

As William was about to speak, one of the women brought a glass to his lips.

"Mr. Cavendish, have a drink."

William pushed her hand away, frowning.

"This isn't fun."

He stood up and walked towards the door. His friend, surprised, quickly followed. "Mr. Cavendish, where are you going?"

William turned, his gaze deep and intense.

"I warn you, don't play any tricks."

A wave of heat surged through him, challenging his rationality.

He managed to stay composed and left. No one dared stop him, but once outside, his steps became unsteady.

Everything seemed to blur and double before his eyes.

He shook his head, trying to clear his mind, but it was almost impossible.

At that moment, he saw a familiar figure, one that made him lose all reason.

"Christina, is that you?"

He stumbled forward, grabbing the person's wrist.

###chapter 73 You Calm Down

Christina was startled by the sudden movement. She turned her head and was shocked to see William standing there.

"Uncle, what are you doing here?"

William's eyes began to glaze over.

He gently lifted her chin and passionately kissed her on the lips.

Everything happened so quickly that Christina didn't even have time to react.

Her mind went blank, and she could only think of one thing.

What is he doing? Why is he kissing me?

Gradually, her rationality returned. She widened her eyes and pushed him away forcefully.

"Uncle, what are you doing? Did you mistake me for someone else? Let go of me."

He clearly hadn't mistaken her.

Christina overlooked the fact that he had called her name as he approached, grabbed her, and pulled her into his arms.

William's grip was strong, and his gaze was intensely passionate, as if he wanted to devour her right then and there.

Christina's hands flailed wildly, and she suddenly felt a decorative object on the hallway wall. She grabbed it and struck William hard.

"Calm down."

Though he didn't pass out, he staggered back a few steps, leaning against the wall in pain.

"Christina..."

His voice was low and seductive, like a lover's gentle call.

Christina got goosebumps.

"Uncle, you're burning up. Are you running a fever? Let me call Bob to come get you."

Christina turned away and used her phone to contact Bob.

She didn't notice Jennifer standing at the corner of the hallway, watching everything unfold.

Jennifer bit her lip tightly.

If she wasn't mistaken, William hadn't confused Christina with someone else. He had called her name and kissed her.

Jealousy surged within Jennifer, making her feel both bitter and sad.

After confirming the location and time with Bob, Christina turned back to check on William.

"Do you want me to help you to a place to rest?"

But seeing him so out of it, she hesitated to get too close.

As she wavered, someone suddenly rushed out from behind her. Jennifer ran over, exclaiming, "Mr. Cavendish, are you okay? You don't look well!"

William was barely holding on, trying to maintain his composure.

Jennifer frowned and turned to scold Christina, "Mr. Cavendish clearly isn't well, and you left him in the hallway. What are you thinking?"

"I don't know where to take him," Christina replied, her voice low.

"Couldn't you have come to find me? Have you forgotten I'm Mr. Cavendish's fiancée?" Jennifer's frown deepened, her words pointed.

Remembering what had just happened, Christina felt at a loss.

At that moment, Bob arrived, sweating profusely.

"Mr. Cavendish, are you alright?"

William closed his eyes in pain. "I'm fine."

Bob sighed in relief and quickly helped him up, supporting him on his shoulder. "Mr. Cavendish, I'll take you home."

Jennifer immediately followed. "I'll come with you."

After a long night of injections and IV fluids, William's fever finally subsided a bit.

William was exhausted, as if he had been through a severe illness, completely drained of energy.

"Where's Christina?"

He asked Bob, who was standing nearby.

Outside the door, Jennifer, holding a bowl of soup, froze upon hearing his question.

"She left after handing you over to me. She probably had something to do. Mr. Cavendish, about tonight..." Bob hesitated, fearing William's anger, and quickly changed the subject.

"He dared to mess with me. He's got a death wish." William's eyes narrowed.

This matter needed to be thoroughly investigated, and Bob understood, immediately agreeing.

Seeing that they no longer mentioned Christina, Jennifer quickly entered the room and placed the soup on the bedside table.

"This will help cool you down."

William didn't move.

Jennifer sighed, wetting a towel with cool water and wiping his forehead. "Mr. Cavendish, it's a good thing you're strong. You pulled through."

William remained expressionless.

"It's late. You should go home."

"How can I leave when something like this happened to you? Let me stay and take care of you," Jennifer insisted.

William's tone was indifferent. "No need. Go home."

He was practically dismissing her.

Jennifer felt a sudden sense of urgency, recalling the events of the day.

If she didn't do something, her past act of saving William's life would soon be forgotten, especially with his growing interest in Christina!

She couldn't just stand by and do nothing.

"Alright, I'll leave after I finish with the soup. Rest well, and I'll see you tomorrow." Jennifer nodded obediently.

She left the bedroom, her face turning grim.

No, she had to take action.

She decided to use an old trick. William was a man who repaid his debts. It was because of her past act of saving his life that she had everything she did now.

After a moment of thought, she devised a plan. She went to a nearby room and set up a delayed short-circuit device by the curtains, following instructions she found online.

Before leaving, she turned on the central air conditioning and other high-power appliances in the room. This way, at night, the short circuit would create sparks that could ignite the curtains.

She felt she had no choice but to do this. She didn't leave but waited quietly in her car.

William was feeling much better.

"You can go now. Make sure to investigate this thoroughly."

Bob nodded. "Yes, Mr. Cavendish. Rest well. I'll be back in the morning."

William said nothing, closing his eyes.

Jennifer waited for over an hour. The window she had targeted began to show signs of fire.

She didn't rush. The flames were still small and not yet dangerous enough to be memorable.

After a few minutes, the flames grew, and the fire started to spread. Jennifer then got out of her car and rushed upstairs.

The fire was bigger than she had anticipated. The second-floor hallway was filled with thick smoke, making it hard to see. She covered her mouth and nose with her sleeve and called out urgently.

"Mr. Cavendish, where are you? Mr. Cavendish!"

A heavy cough came from the bedroom.

Her heart leaped with joy, and she hurried forward, pounding on the door. "Mr. Cavendish, are you in there?"

###chapter 74 Do You Still Want to Confront Him?

Immediately, she didn't think twice and rushed to grab the doorknob, trying to open the door to save him.

Maybe it was because the two rooms were so close together, but the metal doorknob was scorching hot from the fire, and the latch had warped from the heat, making it impossible to open.

Jennifer felt a pang of fear. She had only meant to cause a little accident, not to actually hurt anyone.

Trapped inside the burning room, William stayed surprisingly calm and asked through the door, "Did you call the fire department?"

"I forgot, I'll do it now." Jennifer, trembling, pulled out her phone and dialed 911.

The fire department assured her they would arrive soon, but it would still take a few minutes. Fearing that the smoke might knock William out, she hurried downstairs to the tool shed and grabbed a wrench and an axe.

She repeatedly smashed the door lock, and after several attempts, she nearly broke it.

At that moment, she almost lost all her strength and collapsed to the ground.

The pain she expected didn't come. Instead, a figure emerged from inside and caught her in his arms.

The bedroom, possibly because it was separated by a door, had slightly better air quality and less smoke. Jennifer, however, had inhaled enough smoke to feel dizzy and faint.

But when she saw William holding her with a concerned look on his face, she managed to force a weak smile.

"Seeing you safe is such a relief."

As soon as she finished speaking, her head tilted, and she passed out.

The fire truck arrived quickly. Fortunately, there weren't many flammable materials in the room, so the damage wasn't extensive. William immediately took her to the hospital, and after some treatment, Jennifer woke up.

Possibly due to prolonged smoke inhalation, she started coughing as soon as she woke up.

"Are you okay?"

"I'm fine." William's expression was complicated.

His deep eyes held a myriad of emotions-confusion, reflection, and suspicion.

Jennifer understood that what lay ahead wouldn't be easy. She coughed heavily a few more times. "As long as you're okay."

"Why were you downstairs? Didn't I tell you to leave?" William asked coldly.

"You seemed off today, and I was worried. So I sat in the car for a while and fell asleep. When I woke up, I saw the fire upstairs." Jennifer bit her lip.

William's deep eyes bore into Jennifer's, as if trying to uncover the truth from her gaze.

Jennifer's heart raced. She knew that with William's intelligence, if she lied, he would likely see through it.

She bit her lip harder. "Thinking back on it now, I'm still terrified. If something had happened to you, I wouldn't have been able to live with myself."

She spoke while crying, deeply emotional and heartbroken.

William set aside his doubts. There were security cameras outside the mansion. As long as they checked when she entered the house, they could determine the cause of the fire.

He assigned Bob to investigate, and Bob soon had results.

"The footage shows that Ms. Spencer entered the mansion after the fire started. Also, according to the fire department's investigation, it seems the fire was caused by old wiring in the room, which ignited the nearby curtains."

William nodded slightly. "Alright, let's leave it at that."

Jennifer, standing at the door, heard everything and quietly breathed a sigh of relief.

At the Cavendish family estate, a servant brought an envelope to the study.

"Nicholas, your mail."

"Leave it there," Nicholas said with a nod.

Once he finished his current task, he opened the envelope.

It was a thick stack of photos. As he looked through them, his expression turned dark.

"Get Elisa in here."

When the servant went to fetch Elisa, Gabrielle happened to be there too. Sensing something was up, she followed along.

As soon as they entered the study, Nicholas erupted in anger, throwing the stack of photos in front of Elisa.

"Take a good look. This is the daughter you raised."

Elisa, confused, picked up the photos. After a quick glance, her expression also turned grim.

"Where did these come from?"

"What? Are you upset that someone exposed your and your daughter's ugly scheme to latch onto wealthy men?" Nicholas, still furious, didn't hold back, scolding her harshly.

Gabrielle, secretly pleased to see Elisa getting scolded, still pretended to defend her.

"Dad, don't get so worked up. It's not worth it. Maybe it's not as bad as it seems."

Gabrielle picked up a few photos and gasped after looking at them.

"How could this happen? Weren't they supposed to be nothing? How are they kissing outside?"

Nicholas was livid.

"When you committed that disgraceful act, I let it slide. But now, you dare to let your daughter get involved with her uncle!"

Elisa, after carefully examining the photos, surprisingly stood up for her daughter.

"Dad, look closely. It's clearly William who initiated the kiss. What does this have to do with my daughter?"

Nicholas, fuming, retorted, "Now you're trying to shift the blame? What are you up to? Don't think we don't know!"

"From the start, you joined our family with ulterior motives. Knowing Raymond had no chance of taking over, you tried to use your daughter."

"Don't accuse us unfairly," Elisa argued. "Besides, the photos' location is easy to find. Check the surveillance footage to see what really happened. Why blame my daughter without proof?"

Nicholas gave her a disdainful look. "If your daughter didn't have a history, no one would suspect her."

Elisa, on the verge of tears, held back.

"Dad, who sent you these photos?"

"What? You want to confront them?" Nicholas scoffed.

"Whoever sent these photos has an agenda. We should find out what happened to avoid wronging an innocent person and letting a guilty one go free," Elisa insisted.

Seeing her determination, Gabrielle narrowed her eyes and pretended to be kind.

"Nicholas is so angry. Just admit any fault for now and discuss the rest later. Why be so harsh?"

###chapter 75  What Do You Want to Do?

Elisa's eyes blazed with anger. "This is about my daughter's reputation, and you expect me to just sit back? What are you trying to pull?"

"Enough!" Nicholas's voice cut through the tension like ice.

Elisa stood her ground. "Dad, this guy's intentions are shady. Are you really gonna pin this all on my daughter and trash her name?"

"You won't believe it without proof, huh? Fine, let's get Bob here and find out what really went down."

Nicholas quickly dialed Bob, who showed up in no time.

After a brief rundown, Bob finally grasped the situation.

He hadn't expected such a mess from last night. Before he got there, Mr. Cavendish had kissed Christina.

But now wasn't the time to dwell on that. Clearing his throat, Bob recounted everything he had witnessed.

"Mr. Cavendish went to meet a friend last night. Somehow, he ran into Ms. Windsor. It looked like Mr. Cavendish had been drugged. Ms. Windsor called me to come pick him up."

"Why was Christina there?" Nicholas asked.

"I'm not sure of the details, but I saw Ms. Windsor saying goodbye to some people before she left. She was probably there to meet a client," Bob replied thoughtfully.

"Probably? So you don't know everything that happened before you got there?" Nicholas pressed on.

Bob hesitated but nodded.

Gabrielle's eyes darted around, and she let out a mocking laugh. "They've pulled this stunt before, and now they're at it again. Good thing it didn't work this time."

"What nonsense are you spouting?" Elisa defended anxiously. "My daughter would never do such a thing. If she had, why would she call Bob? Wouldn't it be easier to just go along with it?"

Bob felt incredibly awkward and didn't dare say much, fearing he'd make things worse.

Gabrielle scoffed. "Who knows what she was planning? Maybe she wanted to make a good impression on William."

"Don't slander us. The photos clearly show William initiated the kiss. Now you're trying to blame my daughter for everything. If you want her to take the fall, at least be honest about it instead of pretending to be righteous," Elisa retorted fiercely.

Nicholas felt even more frustrated after hearing this.

"Did he go to the hospital after being drugged? Is he okay? Why hasn't he said anything?" Nicholas asked.

Bob answered meticulously. "Mr. Cavendish probably didn't want to worry his family, so he didn't mention it. It was late, and though he didn't go to the hospital, he did have a private doctor come over. Ms. Spencer was there taking care of him."

"How did Ms. Spencer know about it?" Nicholas frowned.

Bob continued respectfully. "Ms. Spencer was at the meeting that day. She happened to be there and followed him back to take care of him."

"So she was already there when you arrived?" Nicholas inquired.

"Yes," Bob confirmed, not daring to lie.

Gabrielle's mind worked quickly, and she clapped her hands as if she had an epiphany.

"Got it. All the pieces fit now. Good thing you came, Bob, or those two wicked women would have gotten away with it."

"What do you mean by that?" Elisa shot back, her eyes blazing.

Gabrielle sneered, "No wonder Christina called Bob. With Ms. Spencer there, she couldn't pull anything off. Otherwise, she might've succeeded."

"You're talking nonsense!" Elisa fumed.

"Looks like fate stepped in. Everything worked out perfectly," Gabrielle smirked. "Ms. Spencer foiled your plan, and someone snapped photos of your disgrace. Now let's see how you explain this."

The two women continued to argue, their voices rising.

Bob felt like he had messed up big time. He wanted to call William but didn't dare do it in front of everyone.

Nicholas closed his eyes, deep in thought, feeling the noise was unbearable. After a long while, he slammed his fist on the table.

"Everyone, be quiet."

Gabrielle stopped arguing and walked over to massage Nicholas's shoulders.

"Dad, you need to handle this properly."

Nicholas squinted, unable to make a decision.

"Dad, we don't know who took those photos. If this gets out, our family will be ruined. We need to resolve this before that person acts and make sure no one can find fault with us," Gabrielle advised softly.

Nicholas pondered for a moment before speaking slowly, "This matter does need to be addressed."

Elisa bit her lip, understanding what he meant, her face pale. "You want to sacrifice my daughter, don't you?"

"Sacrifice is a strong word. Your daughter simply can't stay here anymore," Nicholas said thoughtfully. "She was never really part of the Cavendish family, and now she's involved in this scandal. It's embarrassing."

Though they weren't related by blood, William was technically her uncle, which would be scandalous if it got out.

"What do you mean?" Elisa's voice trembled.

"The Cavendish family can't have her here. Staying would only cause more rumors, which is bad for both families. Christina is smart and a good student. The Visionary Architecture Academy abroad is a top school. It's a good opportunity for her," Nicholas explained.

Elisa laughed bitterly, "Do you think this is a generous offer, that I should be grateful? But she's my only daughter. How can we be separated?"

Nicholas's face darkened.

Gabrielle smirked, "Given the situation, this is the best option. You should thank Dad. Your words show you're ungrateful."

"No, I won't agree," Elisa said firmly.

Nicholas's eyes flashed with displeasure. He glared at Elisa, his tone firm, "This isn't about your agreement. It's already decided. The Cavendish family's reputation can't be tarnished by an outsider."

Elisa's face turned white. She hadn't expected the Cavendish family to be so cold. She clenched her fists, tears welling up but refusing to fall.

Gabrielle watched with a smug expression.

Before leaving, Nicholas said coldly, "I'll handle the photos. Tell Christina about going abroad. If she refuses, don't blame the Cavendish family for being harsh."

"Dad," Elisa called out, her voice trembling, understanding the threat in his words.

###chapter 76 What Do You People Want to Do?

Nicholas didn't even bother to look up.

Elisa felt utterly helpless. She didn't want Christina to go abroad, but what could she do against the powerful Cavendish family?

After leaving the study, she quickly called Christina.

The phone rang a few times before Christina answered. Elisa, her voice trembling, said, "Christina, something bad happened. Someone took a photo of William kissing you and sent it to Nicholas. Now he wants to send you abroad."

Christina frowned. "How could that happen?"

That night when she met William, he seemed drugged.

William was caught in some conspiracy, and Nicholas was probably taking it out on her.

"Maybe you should lay low for a while?" Elisa suggested.

But they couldn't hide forever. Christina wasn't going to let them control her anymore.

"Don't worry, Mom."

She went to work as usual. As soon as she stepped out of the office after work, a few bodyguards in black appeared in front of her.

"Miss, please get in the car."

"What do you want?" Christina narrowed her eyes.

She couldn't believe Nicholas was trying to force her to leave.

"Nicholas wants to see you," the bodyguard said, his face expressionless.

Christina looked around at them.

"What do you mean? Are you trying to force me?"

"As a member of the Cavendish family, when an elder calls, you should comply," the bodyguards surrounded her, their actions warning her not to try anything funny. If she resisted, they would take her by force.

Christina knew she had no choice. She couldn't make a scene here.

She obediently got into the car.

The car stopped in front of the Cavendish family mansion.

Christina got out and was led to the study by a servant.

Nicholas sat at the desk, his expression icy.

"Grandfather."

She greeted him.

Nicholas gave her a cold look. "You really have no shame, acting like nothing happened? I should never have kept you!"

Christina sneered. "Nicholas, didn't we already clear this up? And that night, it was William who was out of his mind."

"You've used drugs before," Nicholas said, looking down on her.

"How could I have drugged him? He was already like that when I met him," Christina tried to explain.

But Nicholas wouldn't listen, his eyes narrowing coldly.

"Your words are useless now. I've found a good place for you to go, to study abroad."

Christina's tone turned sharp. "Are you really finding me a good place, or are you just throwing me away like trash? If it's about finding a place, I can do that myself. You don't need to worry."

Nicholas was clearly unhappy with her attitude but didn't explode.

"Or do you want to stay and use this scandal to force William's hand?"

"I never thought of that. If I wanted to force him, I would have done it back then. Why would I distance myself? Nicholas, why do you suspect me without reason?"

Christina spoke without much courtesy.

Nicholas's face turned completely dark. "You're getting crazier. This matter is already decided."

Christina narrowed her eyes. "Does William know about this?"

Nicholas sneered. "What, you think he'll keep you here if he knows? You're overestimating yourself. His relationship with Jennifer is going well. You can't just interfere."

"Shouldn't you ask him? He knows it wasn't me and wouldn't blame me," Christina said coldly.

Nicholas was furious. "Are you saying I'm blaming you unfairly?"

Christina stood her ground. "Nicholas, is this really about the photo, or are you just using it as an excuse to send me abroad?"

Nicholas's face turned red with anger. "Is this how you talk to your elders?"

Christina looked him straight in the eye. "I'm not going to just roll over. I did nothing wrong, so why should I be punished? I respect you, but I won't compromise on this."

Nicholas didn't expect her to be so defiant. "Fine, but this isn't up to you to decide!"

He called out to the bodyguards outside the door. "Watch her until she gets on the plane."

With that, Christina was escorted out of the study.

Elisa rushed over. "What did he say?"

Christina's tone was calm. "He wants to send me abroad, thinking he's found a good place for me."

"With so many people watching you, there's no way out," Elisa said, almost in tears.

Christina narrowed her eyes, already formulating a plan. "I won't let them succeed."

"Let me help you. William hasn't said a word about this. Maybe he knows something? I could tell him, and maybe he'll help you," Elisa suggested desperately.

"He won't help me, Mom. Don't bother," Christina shook her head.

"Then what? Am I supposed to watch you go abroad? Once you're sent away, who knows when you'll come back? The Cavendish family wants to drive me to despair. I'll fight them to the end," Elisa said, biting her lip.

Christina felt comforted seeing her mother willing to fight for her. But she still refused. "Mom, don't tell William. He won't help me. I'll handle this myself."

"No," Elisa shook her head.

Just then, Gabrielle walked over. "Nicholas told me to keep an eye on you, to make sure you don't cause trouble."

She was talking to Elisa, indicating that both of them were being watched.

Elisa wanted to argue, but it was pointless. Arguing wouldn't help.

As night fell, the bodyguards opened the door. "Miss, your things are packed. It's time to go."

Christina didn't make a fuss and got into the car, heading to the airport.

About thirty minutes later, the car stopped at the airport, and the bodyguards surrounded her.

She guessed right. For an international flight, no private individual could arrange it so quickly!

As she got out, a bodyguard threatened, "If you make a scene, we'll knock you out."

Christina raised an eyebrow. "And then what? Can you still get me on the plane?"

The bodyguard snorted. "Don't underestimate the Cavendish family's power."

Christina said nothing and walked quickly into the bustling airport, with customs officers patrolling nearby. She acted very cooperative.

###chapter 77: So Arrogant

They hung out in the VIP lounge for a bit before Christina's boarding call came through.

One of the bodyguards motioned for her to go ahead.

Christina nodded, got up, and walked briskly toward the boarding gate. As she got in line, she suddenly clutched her chest and started gasping for air.

She grabbed the nearby railing and collapsed, her body shaking.

Airport staff quickly noticed the commotion and rushed over.

"Ma'am, are you okay? Someone call the medical team, now!"

The bodyguards hadn't expected her to pull this stunt.

"Get on the plane first. We can't delay this flight!"

As the staff member approached her, Christina gripped her wrist tightly. "I've been kidnapped. Please call the police."

The staff member heard her clearly and immediately used her radio to call for airport security.

"We have an emergency here. Get here fast!"

The staff member then turned to the bodyguards with a stern look. "There's a problem here. Until we figure this out, don't make any sudden moves, or you'll regret it."

The bodyguards, worried about the potential fallout for the Cavendish family, didn't dare to act rashly.

Soon, medical personnel and police officers arrived and surrounded Christina.

Finally feeling safer, Christina stopped pretending. "They're traffickers trying to smuggle me out of the country. Please help me."

"Are they really that bold?"

But something seemed off. They were using the VIP channel. Would traffickers really go to such lengths?

Paparazzi, always on the lookout for a scoop, noticed the commotion and started snapping photos.

The bodyguards, feeling awkward, quickly tried to explain. "How could we be traffickers? She's our family's young lady."

"You never asked for my consent. How is this different from trafficking? If it weren't for these kind people helping me, I'd already be out of the country, possibly dead in a foreign land."

Christina didn't hold back. "As an adopted daughter, I'm clearly not as valued as a biological one. For the sake of their own daughter, I'm just a pawn."

She couldn't muster any tears, so she sniffled softly. "My mom only has me. We've already been living cautiously in that big family, and now they want to send me abroad. How can I leave my mother alone?"

Her words hinted at a deeper story.

The crowd took more photos, speculating about her family's background.

Fine, if they wanted to secretly send her abroad, she'd make a big deal out of it.

Who would be embarrassed then?

She had nothing to lose. If she couldn't have a good outcome, neither would anyone else.

One of the bodyguards called Nicholas for instructions.

Nicholas was furious.

"I didn't expect Christina to pull this. She's really become a firecracker."

"What should we do? Should we still force Ms. Windsor onto the plane? The flight's about to take off," the bodyguard asked.

"Forcing her now would just make everyone hate me," Nicholas sighed, though reluctantly. "Get rid of all the paparazzi's photos."

The bodyguards teamed up to chase away the paparazzi.

Christina narrowed her eyes.

"Why are you so scared? Afraid to face the consequences? If you think I'm wrong and insist on sending me away, let the media judge."

With so many people gathered, the airport police also advised, "Maybe you should resolve this privately."

"Fine, but unless it's in a fair and open setting, I won't feel safe." Christina looked at the reporters. "Don't chase them away."

These reporters were her lifeline!

The airport police nodded in agreement and took everyone to a conference room inside the airport.

The bodyguards, not wanting to escalate the situation, quickly said, "I just spoke to Nicholas. He said we can put this matter on hold."

"Really?" Christina sneered. "You've already used force. Forgive me if I find that hard to believe."

"What do you want?" the bodyguard frowned.

Christina looked at the reporters and the police, speaking clearly:

"There might not be any breaking news today, but if you leave your contact information, and I disappear from the country, you'll have a story to follow. Also, I want the police to keep my information. If there's any record of me leaving the country, you must verify it with me in person."

Nicholas didn't want this to blow up, so the bodyguard reluctantly agreed.

"Fine."

"In that case, I have nothing to worry about. There's no need for family disputes to escalate. Nicholas means well, but his methods are wrong." Christina started saying polite things.

She wasn't saying this for Nicholas but for the reporters.

The bodyguards had no choice but to agree.

After everything was settled, they called Nicholas and reported the incident.

Nicholas snorted.

"She's really cunning. We'll have to put this matter on hold."

Christina called Elisa to let her know she was safe.

She returned to the architecture firm.

She had been busy the past few days and had already lost a lot of time yesterday. Thankfully, she was on time for today's meeting.

"You're Mr. Ethan Fisher, right? Sorry to keep you waiting." Christina quickly greeted him.

But she noticed something odd about his last name and instinctively asked.

"Is Mr. Fisher your...?"

Ethan didn't hide it.

"He's my great-uncle."

That made sense. Christina nodded. "Mr. Ethan Fisher, let's discuss the design plans."

Ethan glanced at his watch. "I have a lunch meeting related to this project. Why don't we continue our discussion there? It's just about lunchtime."

Christina hesitated but then nodded.

"Alright."

The lunch was at an upscale restaurant on the top floor, with a scenic elevator that seemed to soar into the clouds.

###chapter 78 Lighting a Cigarette for Him

They had just arrived at the private room and hadn't even taken their seats when people started trickling in.

Ethan greeted everyone with practiced ease.

"Is everyone here?" someone asked.

"The guest of honor hasn't arrived yet," Ethan replied with a smile.

As he spoke, the door opened, and a figure walked in briskly.

When Christina saw who it was, she was stunned.

Wasn't that William? How was it that she kept running into him everywhere? What bad luck.

But clearly, in this setting, neither of them showed any sign of knowing each other. She just followed behind Ethan and greeted everyone.

It seemed like Ethan and William were quite familiar with each other. Ethan casually slung an arm around William's shoulder. "Come on, everyone's been waiting for you. Have a seat."

"Pour the drinks," someone called out as they all sat down.

Ethan introduced her with a smile, "Let me introduce you. This is Christina, one of Kelvin's students. She's handling the project we're working on. She's quite capable."

"Is that so?" William glanced at her.

Christina stood up and poured drinks for everyone.

"I hope you all can look out for me. I'm the least experienced among Kelvin's students, so I appreciate your trust. This drink is for all of you."

With that, she downed her drink in one go.

Her sincerity was clear, making the rest of the evening easier to handle.

In front of everyone, William didn't give her any face. Instead, he took out a cigarette but didn't light it.

Ethan called out, "The lighter's right in front of you. Light his cigarette."

Christina knew he was deliberately targeting her. She took a deep breath, suppressing her frustration. For the sake of her job and career, she picked up the lighter and walked over.

As she lit the flame, William took a deep drag.

In the swirling smoke, his expression was unreadable.

He casually flicked the ash, and it seemed to drift intentionally towards Christina's chest.

Startled, Christina quickly patted it out, but her shirt was still singed with a small black mark.

"Sorry, I didn't notice," William said nonchalantly.

His tone made it hard to believe it wasn't intentional.

Christina suppressed her anger and smiled faintly. "It's fine. I'll go clean up."

William was really too much! But the deal was almost closed, and she didn't want to jeopardize it because of her own issues. She couldn't face Kelvin if she messed this up.

Once outside, she finally felt like she could breathe again.

Ethan sensed something off between them and raised an eyebrow. "Do you two know each other?"

"No," William replied coolly.

Ethan didn't press further and lifted his glass. "Come on, let's drink. It's rare for us to get together. Let's not leave until we're drunk."

William put down his glass and stood up. "I'll be right back."

"Where are you going?" Ethan asked.

But William didn't answer and left the room.

Christina splashed some water on her face and grabbed a tissue to clean the brown stain on her shirt. Though it wasn't burned through, the mark was quite noticeable on the white fabric.

She took a deep breath to calm herself. Just as she was about to leave, she saw William in the mirror.

William closed the door behind him and, before she could react, pinned her against the sink.

"What the hell are you doing?" Christina looked up at him coldly.

William's eyes were probing, dark and deep.

"Isn't it a coincidence that you keep showing up around me, Christina? What are you after?"

"You're overthinking it," Christina glanced at him. "Ethan is my client. How was I supposed to know you two knew each other?"

"You didn't know?" William's eyes filled with anger. "Is it really that coincidental?"

Christina rolled her eyes.

If she had known he would be at this gathering, she would have found any excuse to avoid it.

In her previous life, the distance between her and William was like a galaxy. She had no idea who was in his circle.

"Believe what you want. I don't owe you an explanation. Let go of me!"

Christina struggled.

William was much stronger, and she was no match for him.

"What do you want, William?"

She stomped on his foot and even tried to scratch his face.

William just looked at her coldly.

"If you want people to know we have a connection, go ahead."

Christina's hand froze in mid-air.

She couldn't believe how unreasonable William was. He pushed her away, but when she left, he kept coming after her.

Just then, Ethan's voice came from outside.

"William, are you in the restroom?"

The men's restroom was right next door.

If they both came out of the women's restroom, it would definitely raise questions.

Christina glared at him. "I'll go deal with him."

William watched her with amusement, as if he didn't care.

Seeing he wasn't going to stop her, Christina breathed a sigh of relief, opened the door, and quickly walked out. "Mr. Fisher, I didn't hear anyone come in."

"Let's head back to the room," Ethan said, not suspecting a thing.

After they returned to the room, William came back too. Ethan asked where he had been, but William just drank his wine without answering.

The dinner ended quickly.

As they left, William glanced at her. "Get in the car. I'll give you a ride."

Christina frowned. She didn't want to be associated with him at all. "No need. It's out of your way. I need to go back to school."

She didn't have to go back to school that night, but she didn't want to share a car with William. Plus, she needed to pick up something important.

William didn't argue, just ordered coldly, "Get in the car. Don't make me repeat myself."

Seeing his attitude, Christina didn't want to argue in public. She opened the back door and got in.

William didn't start the car, just glared at her. "Do you think I'm your chauffeur?"

Christina took a deep breath, suppressing her anger, and moved to the front seat.

With graduation approaching, the dorm was almost empty. She quickly found the brooch her father had left her, something very important to her.

William waited downstairs. Just as she reached for the door handle, Missy appeared.

"You're back at school today? Why didn't you say anything?"

###chapter 79 You Are Still the Impressive One

"I just came to grab something and had some other stuff to do, so I didn't tell you guys," Christina said casually.

Missy noticed the car Christina was in and exaggeratedly exclaimed, "Wow, look at this fancy car! You're really living it up."

Christina just smiled faintly and stayed quiet.

But Missy had other thoughts. She recognized the man in the driver's seat as William, a top-tier wealthy individual. Who wouldn't want to get close to someone like that? A life of luxury would be guaranteed.

She deliberately opened the car door. "I've never been in a car like this before. Mind if I check it out?"

Christina knew exactly what Missy was getting at and smiled lightly. "Sure, I'm sure Mr. Cavendish wouldn't mind."

William frowned.

"I heard you recently got into the architecture school. Can you do me a favor?" Missy asked.

Christina furrowed her brows. "Depends on what it is. But if you're trying to get into our architecture school, I really can't help with that."

"Why not?" Missy bit her lip.

Christina sighed. "Kelvin is super strict with me, and he publicly said he wouldn't take on any more students. If I go against him, wouldn't that be disrespectful? Missy, you wouldn't want to put me in a tough spot, right?"

Missy was taken aback, not expecting Christina to turn the tables on her. She awkwardly smiled and said, "Of course, that's really unfortunate. If Mr. Fisher isn't interested, I won't push it."

When they arrived at their destination, Missy marveled, "We've known each other for so long, and you've never invited me over."

In her previous life, even when they were close, Christina never did because she knew that no place was truly her home. Here, she was just a guest.

"This is my uncle's private residence. I'll head back in the car, and the driver will come to pick you up later," Christina said with a faint smile.

"Alright!" Missy was glad for the opportunity.

William frowned. "You're leaving already?"

"Yeah, it's not convenient for us to stay together. I don't want any photos getting back to Nicholas," Christina said, tilting her head before quickly leaving.

Missy smiled. "Don't mind her. She's ungrateful. I'm a bit thirsty. Can you get me a glass of water?"

"Get it yourself from the kitchen," William said coldly.

Missy knew this was her only chance. She turned to look at him, then fetched a glass of water. As she walked towards him, she pretended to trip, spilling the water on William's chest and falling into his arms.

She immediately put on a panicked expression. "I'm so sorry! Let me clean it up."

William's face darkened, and he gritted his teeth. "Let go!"

Missy wasn't about to miss this opportunity. Alone with him, she placed her hand on his chest. "Mr. Cavendish, your muscles are really firm."

William narrowed his eyes and kicked her away.

Missy flew across the room, hitting her chest hard and colliding with the table leg. A sharp crack echoed through the room.

Her leg was broken!

The pain was so intense she nearly passed out, screaming in agony.

William, disgusted, called for his bodyguards. "Get her out of here."

The bodyguards obeyed, tossing her outside to fend for herself.

Missy, nearly delirious with pain, gritted her teeth and called for an ambulance.

Christina watched from a distance, feeling conflicted. She knew William's temper and that he wouldn't let provocations slide, but his handling of the situation still surprised her.

Evil begets evil, she thought, and left without further concern.

Breaking her leg wasn't a small matter, and Missy's personality wouldn't let it go. She was clearly going to cling to William.

Bob was sent to handle the situation. Standing by her hospital bed, he asked, "Will your leg heal?"

Missy, agitated, replied, "It's broken! What do you think? He has to take responsibility."

"What? Do you expect Mr. Cavendish to marry you and take care of you for the rest of your life? Let me warn you, this is your own doing. If you want to make a big deal out of it, Mr. Cavendish will see it through. He broke your leg, and he'll take responsibility for that."

Missy had no choice but to accept the compensation, knowing she couldn't fight William.

The incident didn't blow up, but word got around. Jennifer heard about it and, after learning Missy's identity, suspected Christina was behind it, possibly trying to use her classmates against William, only to be thwarted.

Feeling a sense of urgency, Jennifer made a call. "I can't wait any longer. Christina is becoming too important to William. I need to get rid of her!"

A voice on the other end replied, "Now isn't the right time."

"Then tell me when is! Am I supposed to just watch William get taken away by her? I can't stand it," Jennifer said, agitated.

"What do you plan to do?"

"I don't care about anything else. I just want Christina gone. Find a way to make it happen!" Jennifer said with hatred.

After a moment of silence, the voice responded, "I'll think of something."

Kaitlyn's birthday was approaching, and she visited the architecture school to hand out invitations, especially to Christina.

"I'm most looking forward to you coming, so you have to be there. Grandpa said it's a great opportunity to meet influential people. You can expand your network."

"Sure," Christina agreed without hesitation.

Kaitlyn hugged her and blew a kiss. "I knew you were the best."

"Stop being so clingy. I can't handle it," Christina said, shaking her head.

With the invitation in hand, she had no reason to decline. She carefully selected a handcrafted piece as a birthday gift, spending quite a bit.

The party was in the evening, and she planned to head over after work.

The birthday party was at the Fisher Mansion, lavishly decorated, showing how much Kelvin valued Kaitlyn.

###chapter 80 What Are Your Thoughts?

Rumor had it that the Fisher Mansion was designed by Kelvin himself decades ago, and it had a unique style. As soon as Christina stepped inside, she couldn't help but take a few extra glances.

Kaitlyn came bouncing over to her.

"So, what do you think? Pretty sweet, huh?"

"It's more than sweet," Christina nodded with a smile. "And I'm thrilled to see Kelvin's work up close."

"Did you bring me a gift?" Kaitlyn asked playfully, extending her hand.

"Of course I did. I wouldn't forget you," Christina said, handing over the gift.

"I can't wait to see it!" Kaitlyn eagerly tore open the package.

But when she opened the box, her expression froze. Inside was a piece of building stone with a sticky note that said "Happy Birthday."

Bruce and the other architecture students, who had arrived with Kaitlyn, happened to walk by and saw the gift. They couldn't help but laugh.

"Come on, Christina, you just landed a few big projects. You can't be that broke."

"Yeah, if you're going to pick a stone, at least pick something interesting. What's so special about a piece of marble?"

Everyone burst into laughter, and Kaitlyn's face turned sour. Receiving such a gift on her birthday was embarrassing.

Christina immediately realized the gift had been switched. She had chosen a handcrafted item, not a piece of stone.

But she quickly composed herself. "This isn't my gift. It must have been mixed up."

"So, who are you planning to give this stone to?" someone mocked.

Christina ignored the taunts. "No worries, I have another gift for you. That dress you're wearing is beautiful, but it doesn't quite suit you."

"What do you have in mind?" Kaitlyn raised an eyebrow.

"Let me make some adjustments." Christina called for a sewing kit, which fortunately was available.

In front of everyone, she made some quick alterations, drawing everyone's attention.

When she finished, the dress not only looked more stylish but also accentuated Kaitlyn's figure perfectly.

Anyone with an eye for fashion could see the difference.

"Wow, that's amazing! The original was nice, but it had a bit of a craftsman feel."

"Do you like this gift?" Christina asked with a smile.

Kaitlyn was over the moon.

This birthday, Kaitlyn felt like the star of the show. Standing in the center, basking in everyone's admiration, she was sure the person she liked was watching her too.

And the dress was perfect!

"Thank you so much, I love it."

Christina breathed a sigh of relief. She had managed to turn things around just in time.

She smiled at the crowd, but then she noticed William standing not far away, holding a glass of champagne and watching her calmly.

She hadn't expected him to be there, but it made sense. The Cavendish family was involved in various industries, including real estate.

And since he knew Ethan, it wasn't surprising he was invited.

As the guest of honor, Kaitlyn couldn't stay with Christina for long. After chatting for a bit, she moved to the center of the room.

The cake was soon brought out, shaped like a princess and looking very dreamy. Everyone gathered to celebrate Kaitlyn's birthday.

Christina felt a pang of envy. Since her father passed away, her mother had been working tirelessly, and it had been a long time since anyone had thrown her such a grand birthday party.

The room filled with the sound of the birthday song.

Kaitlyn closed her eyes, made a wish, and blew out the candles.

"Thank you all for coming to my birthday. Now, let's dance!"

Music started playing, and the room came alive. People began inviting each other to dance.

Kaitlyn glanced hopefully at Stanley, wishing he would ask her to dance.

But Stanley just sat there, not moving. Frustrated, Kaitlyn picked up a small cake with a single candle.

"Stanley!"

Stanley looked over and smiled faintly.

"Why aren't you dancing, birthday girl?"

Kaitlyn tilted her head playfully. "Because I still have one last wish to make."

"Why didn't you make it?" Stanley raised an eyebrow.

Kaitlyn's eyes sparkled with shyness. "Because my last wish is about you."

Stanley was taken aback. "A wish about me? What is it?"

Kaitlyn saw this as her chance. She clasped her hands together and said seriously, "Today is my twenty-first birthday. My last wish is for the person I like to like me back."

Stanley stiffened.

He seemed to understand her implication.

Seeing his silence, Kaitlyn felt a pang of regret. She had been so clear, yet he still didn't respond.

She sighed. "Do you know why I made this wish about you? Because the person I like is you. I hope we can be together. Will you say yes?"

Stanley shook his head, his expression serious. "Kaitlyn, stop. I've known you since you were a teenager. I've always seen you as a little sister."

Kaitlyn's shy smile froze.

"Why reject me? Can't you at least give us a chance? Maybe I'm the kind of person you could love."

Stanley took a deep breath.

"To be honest, I already have someone I like. So I can't accept your feelings."

"Someone you like? Is it Christina? Did you fall for her at first sight?" Kaitlyn's voice was tinged with jealousy and sadness.

She hoped Stanley would deny it.

But after a moment's hesitation, Stanley nodded.

"Yes, the person I like is Christina. We share the same interests. Thank you for your courage; it has inspired me. I should tell the person I like how I feel."

William, who had been listening, paused with his drink in hand.

Kaitlyn watched in disbelief as Stanley stood up and walked towards Christina.

Stanley approached Christina and took a deep breath. "Christina, from the moment I first saw you, I knew I liked you."

###chapter 81 Won't Give You the Chance to Be Mrs. Cavendish

Christina was still a bit confused.

Was this a confession?

Seeing her stunned expression, Stanley quickly added, "You don't have to give me an answer right away. Take your time to think about it. I really like you. We're in the same industry, we share the same interests, and we'll definitely have a lot to talk about in the future."

Christina laughed. There was no need to think about it.

The only thing she could think of was to refuse.

"Stanley, I..."

Before she could finish, Stanley interrupted, "I understand your concerns. Maybe there are some obstacles between us, but I'm willing to overcome them. I'm willing to give you time to see my sincerity."

His words made it hard for her to refuse directly.

"Do you know Kaitlyn likes you?"

Stanley didn't avoid the question and nodded slightly. "I know, but feelings can't be one-sided."

"I want to tell you the same thing," Christina said sincerely.

William stood not far away, gripping his champagne glass so tightly it seemed like it might shatter.

Just as she finished speaking, the sound of breaking glass suddenly came from the other side.

It turned out that Kaitlyn had knocked over a small champagne tower.

Seeing everyone's eyes on her, Kaitlyn gave Stanley a resentful look and ran off.

Kelvin didn't stop her, frowning. "What's wrong with her?"

Ethan glanced over and quickly reassured him, "Don't worry, I'll go after her."

"Go quickly. Kaitlyn really should be more mindful of the occasion," Kelvin sighed.

With the main character gone, the birthday party naturally lost its charm.

Guests began to leave one after another.

Christina sighed. She didn't know what to say in such a situation. She wanted to find Kaitlyn to explain, but she didn't know where she was.

Stanley didn't seem to think he was the cause of the problem.

"Let me take you home, it's late and it's not safe for you to be alone."

"No need," Christina shook her head. "There's no possibility between us, and I'm not interested in a relationship right now."

Stanley still held onto a sliver of hope. "Is it because you're good friends with Kaitlyn?"

Christina was sincere. "No, it's because I don't like you."

Stanley's expression turned sad.

"Let me at least take you home."

Christina shook her head again. "No, to avoid any misunderstandings, it's best if we don't have any contact."

Stanley's hand froze in mid-air. He sighed deeply, unable to say a word. As Christina stepped outside, a car roared up and stopped right in front of her.

It was William!

He rolled down the window and said coldly, "Get in."

Christina wanted to refuse.

"Don't make me say it twice," William's tone carried a hint of threat.

Christina had no choice but to get in the car.

"Already moving on to another guy? How long have you known him before he confessed?"

"This has nothing to do with you. Even if I date, it's a normal relationship," Christina said coldly.

William's words cut deep.

"Someone like you can't make it work with me, so you set your sights on someone else? What can he offer you?"

Christina gritted her teeth. "You really think so little of people."

William sneered. "Isn't that exactly who you are?"

"You!" Christina couldn't reason with him and didn't want to argue anymore. She reached for the door handle.

The door was locked.

She tried to grab the steering wheel.

William slammed on the brakes, pulled out his belt, tied her hands, and threw her into the back seat.

Christina felt a wave of despair.

"What are you doing?"

William said nothing, speeding all the way to a villa.

He got out, opened the back door, hoisted her over his shoulder, and carried her upstairs, throwing her onto the bed. He began unbuttoning his shirt.

Christina sensed danger and panicked. "What are you doing? Let me go."

"Christina, are you always this fickle? Flirting with one guy after another?"

William's eyes narrowed, and he leaned in, his hot kiss falling on her.

With her hands tied, Christina had no way to resist. A tear silently slid down her cheek.

Her heart was filled with despair and anger. Her tears were not from fear, but from humiliation and being misunderstood.

"William, this is illegal. Let me go!" Christina shouted, trying to awaken his reason.

William sneered and began to have sex with her.

His actions were not gentle, almost violent.

Even though it hurt, Christina bit her lip and said nothing.

He seemed insatiable, fucking her over and over.

The entire night felt like a pitch-black nightmare from which she couldn't wake.

It wasn't until the deep night, when everything outside was immersed in silent darkness, that William finally stopped, exhausted. He lay beside her, taking a deep breath.

Christina lay there, physically and emotionally drained. Her tears had dried, leaving only the pain in her heart. She could feel the physical pain, but the pain in her heart was worse.

She didn't understand why William had become like this. Their relationship hadn't been like this before.

She struggled to get up, opened the dial screen, and started to dial 911.

Her finger hovered over the call button, hesitating.

If she called the police, it would blow up. Everything she had hoped for would be gone.

Her relationship with William would be exposed, and during the investigation, the media would swarm. Her peaceful life would be over.

With this in mind, she turned off her phone, feeling like her heart was bleeding.

William saw her actions and sneered.

"Why didn't you call?"

"Do you want the Cavendish family's reputation ruined?" Christina said, like a walking corpse.

"Do you care about that? You still want to be connected to me." William lit a cigarette, smoke swirling around him.

Christina was too tired to argue. She laughed bitterly. "If you know my intentions, aren't you afraid I'll cling to you?"

"I won't give you the chance to be Mrs. Cavendish," William said coldly.

A tear fell from Christina's eye. She quietly wiped it away and got up to get dressed.

###chapter 82 A Very Niche Decoration Style

After that, Christina checked into a hotel.

She stayed in bed for five days before finally getting up to move around.

Just as she was about to head to the library, her phone rang.

It was Kelvin calling.

She answered immediately, "Hey, Kelvin! What's up?"

"Christina, I've got some good news for you," Kelvin said cheerfully. "You've been doing great work lately. Ethan even gave you a shout-out the other day. Keep it up."

Christina smiled, feeling a surge of pride. "Thanks, Kelvin. I really appreciate it. I'll keep giving it my all."

When it comes to work, you get out what you put in.

Her efforts were never in vain.

Kelvin then asked about her studies before getting to the point. "I'm calling to see if you have some free time. I have another part-time job for you. It'll last about three months, and the pay is pretty good."

"I've got time, thanks, Kelvin," Christina agreed without hesitation.

Why wouldn't she take a job that pays well?

She could handle being busier and having a tighter schedule. She really wanted to make money.

Having money meant having choices. Rather than being pressured by her family to marry some old man, she'd rather work herself to the bone to earn her own money. At least then, the choice would be hers.

She refused to be some man's kept woman.

"Alright, I'll send you the details. The contact info is in there, so you can reach out directly. I'll leave it to you," Kelvin said with a laugh.

After hanging up, he forwarded the project details to Christina.

It was a project to expand a beachside villa. The client, Mia Wilson, had simple needs: she wanted to add two sunrooms on the top floor and redesign the front and back yards.

Christina first gathered some classic garden design images, then left the library to find a quiet spot to call Mia.

When it comes to renovations, everyone has their own ideas. The most important thing is to meet the client's expectations.

She called, and Mia answered quickly. "Who is this?"

"Hi, I'm Christina Windsor, a designer. When would you be available to meet and discuss your renovation ideas?"

Mia liked Christina's straightforward approach, unlike the previous designers who had given long-winded self-promotions.

Mia was the one paying, so she wanted the house to be designed to her liking, not the designer's.

Hoping Christina would be more reliable, Mia checked her schedule. "How about today? I have a beauty appointment this afternoon, so let's meet at five at the café next to the downtown mall. Just give my name, Mia."

"Great, see you at five," Christina agreed.

She returned her books to her dorm, changed clothes, applied light makeup, and arrived at the café by 4:30.

After giving the server Mia's name, she was led to a private room. "Please wait a moment, Ms. Mia Wilson will be here shortly."

"Sure, I'll have a lemon water, please," Christina said, reviewing her design sketches while waiting.

At five o'clock, Mia arrived right on time.

She placed her Himalayan platinum bag on the table and shook Christina's hand. "I thought you sounded young on the phone, but you're even younger than I imagined."

"Though I'm young, I have plenty of experience. You can trust me on that," Christina assured, worried Mia might reject her due to her age.

Mia laughed. "I don't care about your age. As long as your designs are good and you understand my needs, that's what matters. The previous designers didn't get it, so I thought I'd try a female designer."

Christina hadn't expected that.

She had to thank the previous designers for their arrogance; otherwise, she wouldn't have landed this job.

After some small talk, Christina showed Mia the design sketches she had prepared. "Ms. Wilson, do you like any of these styles? These are just templates; the final design will be tailored to your preferences."

Mia didn't even look at them. "I don't like the usual styles-Chinese, European, I've seen them all. I have many properties, and this beach villa is just for vacations."

Christina immediately understood.

For someone with only one house, practicality is important. But for someone like Mia, who owns multiple properties, practicality is secondary to personal preference.

"Ms. Wilson, tell me what you like, and I'll sketch something now. If you like it, we can sign the contract," Christina said, opening her design software.

Mia took a sip of coffee and then surprised Christina. "I want the sunrooms to have a wild, primitive style."

Christina was stunned, almost thinking she misheard.

Primitive style?

That's quite niche.

"Have you seen prehistoric movies? I want that kind of style-a big cave with lots of vines outside. Since it's a sunroom, I want a skylight on top and walls all around for privacy."

Based on Mia's description, Christina quickly sketched a rough design.

She showed Mia the screen. "Ms. Wilson, is this what you had in mind?"

"Yes, exactly! You get me. It's so much easier talking to another woman," Mia said, delighted.

She was now fully convinced of Christina's abilities. "How much do you charge? Name your price, and we'll sign the contract now."

"Now?" Christina was taken aback.

She hadn't even given a quote yet!

Mia nodded. "Yes, whatever you charge, I'll pay. I have the money. The main thing is you understand me. The previous male designers didn't get it. They gave me a cave-like bed with cabinets and a desk. How is that primitive style?"

Christina could only imagine how frustrated Mia must have been seeing those designs.

###chapter 83 Shameless

They could've just said they couldn't come up with a design instead of wasting Mia's time.

What really ticked her off was that these designers turned around and blamed her, saying her ideas were unrealistic and impractical. The most outrageous one even said he'd contact her husband to see if he agreed.

This was just ridiculous!

Mia's family owned a company, and she was their only daughter. Even her husband's job was given to him by her parents. Did she really need her husband's approval to renovate their house?

"Ms. Windsor, I'm usually very busy and don't have time to oversee the renovation on-site. You handle the materials and budget; I just want the final product," Mia said.

Christina thought to herself: What a great client!

Christina quoted a standard market price and then took out a prepared contract from her bag. "We need a 30% deposit before we start the design, another 40% after the design is completed, and the remaining balance once the house is fully renovated."

"That's fine," Mia said, signing her name on the contract and transferring the deposit to Christina.

After discussing the sunroom's design, Mia shared her ideas for the front and back yards. "How long will it take you to complete the design?"

"About three days. I need to do some measurements first. Ms. Mia Wilson, would you prefer to give me a key or set a temporary code?" Christina asked.

Mia immediately took a key out of her bag and handed it to her.

People often connect by fate, and Mia felt Christina was reliable from their first meeting. Besides, no one lived in the villa, and there were no valuables inside. Giving Christina the key was no big deal. "You can go anytime to take measurements. If possible, I'd like the progress to be quick."

Christina put the key in her bag.

Since Mia was in a hurry and Christina had no plans for the evening, she took a cab to the seaside after leaving the café.

Mia had already informed the security at the community. When Christina arrived, the guard didn't stop her and even helpfully pointed her in the right direction. "Ms. Mia Wilson's villa is the one at the very end. Don't get lost."

"Thank you," Christina said, following his directions and quickly finding Mia's villa.

She used the key to open the door and saw a red dress on the sofa, very revealing in style. Several pairs of high heels were scattered on the floor.

These obvious signs of life suggested that Ms. Mia Wilson had been staying here recently. Christina decided to call Mia to avoid any awkward timing issues, like walking in on the couple.

When Mia answered, she frowned. "How could that be? I haven't been there in a while, and my husband has been traveling a lot. The villa should be empty. That's why I gave you the key. Take some photos of the clothes and send them to me."

Christina's intuition told her something was off.

She had a vague suspicion but didn't want to jump to conclusions about someone else's personal matters. She took photos of the entire living room and sent them to Mia.

The moment Mia saw the photos, her face darkened, and her heart sank. The clothes and shoes weren't hers. Could her husband be cheating on her?

"Ms. Windsor, could you check the other rooms for signs of occupancy and send me photos if you find anything?" Mia took a deep breath, trying to keep her composure.

"Don't worry, I'll compensate you for your help," Mia added.

Christina could hear the sadness in her voice. No woman could easily accept her husband's betrayal, especially someone as vibrant and confident as Mia.

Christina sighed. "I was going to check the villa anyway. You don't need to pay me extra."

As a fellow woman, she wanted to help as much as she could.

The villa had four floors. Christina checked each room. Besides the living room, the master bedroom on the fourth floor showed signs of use, with messy sheets and used tissues on the floor.

She took more photos and sent them to Mia.

"Ms. Windsor, you can go home for now. I'll meet you at the villa tomorrow morning. My husband is supposed to be on a business trip, and I want to see the place myself," Mia said, wiping away her tears.

She couldn't tolerate betrayal. If her husband no longer loved her, they could divorce amicably. But she couldn't stand infidelity. She had helped him rise to a high position and could just as easily bring him down.

The next morning, Christina and Mia arrived at the villa together.

Mia's eyes were red, clearly from crying the night before.

She stood at the door, steeling herself, then pushed it open. The first thing she saw was her husband's briefcase in the entryway.

"Isn't it funny? He claims to be on a business trip to provide a better life for me and our child, but his bag is here while he's supposedly away. What a liar," Mia said with a bitter laugh.

She took out a camera and told Christina, "Please wait downstairs. I need to gather some evidence."

Christina nodded.

After Mia went upstairs, Christina waited in the living room.

Suddenly, a woman with long, wavy hair and scanty clothing emerged from the bathroom. She looked Christina up and down with hostility. "Does your family know you're a prostitute? So young and already a homewrecker. You're shameless! Aiden is my husband."

Christina almost laughed in disbelief.

This woman, dressed like that in Mia's house, was clearly the mistress. And now she was insulting Christina!

Christina retorted, "Are you sure Aiden is your husband? Do you have a marriage certificate?"

"I..." The woman was momentarily speechless.

But she quickly regained her composure. She had seen Mia's photo and knew Christina didn't look like her. So she assumed Christina was another mistress and felt emboldened.

"I've known Aiden for five years. We have a son together. If he's not my husband, then whose is he? You shameless woman!"

"William, isn't that Christina? What's she doing in someone else's house?" Jennifer's voice suddenly came from outside.

###chapter 84 She is a Designer

Christina spun around.

She saw Jennifer standing with Ethan and William, all of them just standing at the door, watching her.

"If you need money, just tell us. We can lend you some. There's no need to become someone's mistress. You haven't even graduated yet. How can you degrade yourself like this?" Jennifer's words seemed sympathetic, but each one was designed to make others think the worst.

"Do you realize you're trespassing?" Christina shot her a cold look. "Get out."

"William has a villa here too. I came to see him today. When I got to the yard, I heard your voice. I was worried you might be in trouble, so I came to check. Don't misunderstand, I'm not here to mock you. If you have any difficulties, just tell me. I'll do my best to help." Jennifer continued her insincere speech.

The woman with the wavy hair already disliked Christina and wouldn't miss such a good opportunity.

Her face was full of mockery. "This is my husband's house. The real trespasser is you. What, you think you're the owner now, you little thief?"

"Christina!" William suddenly called her name.

His eyes were fierce, and his tone was even colder. "Get out of here right now. Stop embarrassing yourself!"

He couldn't believe Christina had the nerve.

Being a mistress to a married man was bad enough, but getting caught in the act? She was disgracing the Cavendish family.

"If you're sick, see a doctor. Don't act crazy here." Christina met his murderous gaze. "I'm a designer. I came here for work. It's not what you think."

Of course, William didn't believe her.

What kind of designer gets yelled at like that?

At a time like this, Christina was still trying to lie.

Jennifer walked over, pretending to be concerned, and took Christina's hand. "Come with us. I'll have William help resolve this. At least don't let it get to the school, or you won't even get your diploma."

Her words reminded the wavy-haired woman.

"You came to my house, and now you want to leave just like that? No way. I'm going to your school to ask how they educate their students!"

"Don't be like that. She made a mistake, but she deserves a chance to make amends. Name your price, and I'll compensate you for her." Jennifer was almost laughing inside but kept up her act.

Christina pulled out the contract she had signed with Mia and threw it in the woman's face.

"Look closely. I came here with Ms. Mia Wilson. Mia is Aiden's wife."

Hearing Mia's name, the woman panicked.

Mia was here too?

But she hadn't seen Mia. Was Christina lying, or was Mia upstairs?

If Mia was upstairs, she was in big trouble.

"Christina, you came prepared, but forging a contract is illegal." Jennifer was still stubborn.

Christina chuckled. "Why bother?"

Jennifer had rushed over, eager to frame her, only to humiliate herself.

William took the contract and glanced at it. Unlike Jennifer, he could tell it was legitimate.

So Christina really was here for business. He had misunderstood her.

"William, are you going to say this contract is fake too?" Christina mocked him.

Before William could respond, Mia came down with Aiden.

Her eyes were red, but she never looked back. Aiden, on the other hand, was nervous, constantly explaining himself.

The wavy-haired woman's first instinct was to run, but Christina quickly grabbed her arm and told Mia, "This lady thought I was another mistress and kept saying Aiden was her husband."

"No, it's a misunderstanding. My husband just has the same name." The woman tried to lie.

But with witnesses and evidence, who would believe her?

Mia sneered. "Don't worry, I won't fight you for a bad man. I'll get a lawyer and file for divorce. He's all yours."

The woman was initially pleased.

Until Mia pulled out the property deed. "But I should warn you, this house is my premarital property, as are the others. His job was given by my father. After the divorce, he won't get a dime."

"Mia, I don't want a divorce. We have a child. Give me another chance. Our daughter needs her father." Aiden pleaded.

Mentioning their daughter made Mia hesitate.

Christina reminded her, "His daughter needs her father, and so does his son."

Mia wasn't stupid. She immediately understood the implication.

Aiden not only had a mistress but also a son. How dare he?

"This divorce is happening. No one will take my daughter's inheritance." Mia made a call.

Soon, the security guards arrived. Under Mia's orders, they dragged Aiden and the woman out, leaving the villa quiet.

"Ms. Windsor, I want to demolish all the renovations and start over. I don't want anything they've touched. We'll sign a new contract, and you can handle the entire renovation." Mia smiled at Christina.

"Thank you for coming with me today. We're friends now. If you ever need help, call me anytime."

Jennifer watched, feeling miserable.

Why?

She had rushed over to see Christina humiliated, not to see her make friends.

But no matter how upset she was, Jennifer didn't dare show it. In front of William, she always maintained her gentle demeanor.

"Jennifer," Christina suddenly called her name. "You were so concerned about me earlier. Now that the misunderstanding is cleared up, aren't you happy for me?"

"Yes." Jennifer forced a smile that looked worse than crying.

Christina wanted to mock her more, but William frowned. "Jennifer was just worried about you. Don't be unreasonable."

His words were ridiculous.

Jennifer had framed her, and he had joined in the accusations. Now, she hadn't even said anything that harsh, and he was already defending Jennifer.

Christina couldn't stand their disgusting faces anymore. She shut the villa door and decided to take a walk on the beach.

###chapter 85 Deliberate Framing

Jennifer watched Christina's retreating figure and suddenly had a brilliant idea.

She turned to William. "Hey, hang tight for a sec. I need to talk to her."

"What do you need to say to her?" William didn't want them getting too close.

It was clear Christina didn't like Jennifer. If Jennifer went over now, things would definitely get ugly.

Jennifer sighed. "I misunderstood her earlier. Even if she doesn't forgive me, I still need to apologize. It's the right thing to do. I'll be right back."

Seeing her determination, William didn't argue further.

Jennifer hurried along and finally caught up with Christina on the beach.

With no one else around, Jennifer dropped her facade and sneered, "Christina, I didn't think you had any real skills besides seducing men. You even managed to win over that old lady."

Mia was only in her thirties, but Jennifer made her sound ancient.

Christina didn't appreciate the comment. "What, you planning to kick the bucket at 35?"

"No matter how you twist things, William will never marry you. The Cavendish family would never accept someone like you." Jennifer was in the middle of her rant when she noticed William and Ethan approaching from a distance.

She quickly grabbed Christina's hand and raised her voice. "I just want to be friends. There's no need for you to be so hostile."

"Are you nuts? If you want to play innocent, do it with William. I'm not buying it." Christina's first instinct was to shake her off.

But Jennifer held on tight, even pulling her back.

They were standing right by the ocean.

While falling from this height wouldn't be fatal, Christina didn't want to end up looking pathetic, nor did she want to give Jennifer the satisfaction.

"Ah!" Jennifer screamed as she fell into the water.

Christina stumbled but managed to stay on her feet. She was wearing sandals, and her exposed big toe got cut by a sharp rock, bleeding profusely.

When William arrived, he only saw Jennifer in the water, not noticing Christina's injured foot.

He rushed over to help Jennifer up.

Jennifer looked a mess, soaked from head to toe, her white shirt clinging to her body, revealing her underwear.

Her face was a mix of seawater and tears. "Christina, what did I ever do to you? Just because I misunderstood you earlier, you had to push me into the ocean!"

"I apologized, and even if you don't want to forgive me, you could've just yelled at me or hit me. But pushing me into the water? There are rocks here, and it really hurts."

Christina watched her performance with a cold expression.

Honestly, Jennifer's acting was terrible, but there were always people who fell for it.

Listening to her sob story and seeing Christina's indifferent face, William scolded her. "Why are you being so petty?"

Jennifer had indeed wronged her earlier, but it wasn't completely baseless.

Christina had shown up at someone else's house alone and was accused of being a mistress. It was a misunderstanding.

Now that the misunderstanding was cleared up and Jennifer had apologized, what more did Christina want?

"Fine, you're right. I'm just that petty. So you two better stay out of my sight." Christina sneered. "You both know what kind of person I am, yet you keep coming to me. Who's to blame?"

She had tried to keep her distance from them.

But Jennifer had to come over and provoke her with such bad acting.

Christina exposed her lie. "You tried to pull me into the water and ended up falling in yourself. Stop pretending, Jennifer."

"I don't know what I did to make you hate me so much. I'm soaked, and you still say it's my fault. William, what do I have to do for her to forgive me?" Jennifer clung to William's clothes.

She kept pressing herself against him. "I'm so cold and it hurts."

William took off his jacket and draped it over her. "I'll take you to the hospital first to check for injuries."

"But Christina..."

"Forget about her for now." William was focused on getting Jennifer to the hospital.

"You're so good to me, William." Jennifer gave Christina a triumphant look when William wasn't watching.

There were no cameras on the beach.

Even if Christina was innocent, she had no way to prove it.

And William trusted Jennifer the most.

Watching them leave, Christina rolled her eyes.

She was fed up.

"Your foot is injured too. Let me take you to the hospital." Ethan hadn't followed them but stayed by Christina's side.

"I have a place nearby, or you can come to my house, and I'll help you bandage it."

Christina shook her head. "No need to trouble you. I'll just call a cab to the hospital."

If the wound was shallow, it would be fine, but it was deep, and she needed to get it checked.

Ethan stayed with her until the cab arrived.

It was past rush hour, so the traffic wasn't bad. She reached the hospital in less than half an hour.

After paying, Christina limped towards the entrance.

A hand suddenly reached out to support her.

She turned to see who it was and quickly pulled her hand back. "I think it's best if we keep our distance."

"Sorry about last time. I didn't expect my mom to cause such a scene and make everyone uncomfortable." Walter had wanted to apologize for a while but hadn't found the chance.

Seeing her injured today, he took the opportunity to help her to the doctor and apologize.

"I've made it clear to my mom. I'm old enough now, and she can't control me so strictly or cause a scene."

"She did it for your own good." Christina didn't hold it against him.

But they really should keep their distance. "I can walk on my own. You should go. I don't want to cause any more trouble if someone sees us."

###chapter 86 Forbidden Love

"But your foot's hurt. Even if you were a stranger, I'd still help. It's just the right thing to do," Walter insisted, refusing to let go.

He couldn't just stand by and watch Christina hobble along.

Christina gave a bitter smile. "Last time at the Cavendish Mansion, we all thought the same, but it ended up being a mess."

"I'll stay until you see the doctor, then I'll leave," Walter said, stepping back.

The registration kiosk was just ahead, and Christina didn't want to argue any further, so she agreed.

As luck would have it, when they went to register, William was just coming out of a clinic with Jennifer.

"William, why is Christina with Walter again?" Jennifer asked, unaware of what had happened at the Cavendish Mansion.

She said it to imply that Christina was shameless and couldn't be without a man.

William's face darkened.

Christina just couldn't stay out of trouble.

But this was a family matter, and he didn't want to make a scene in front of others. "I'll have my assistant take you home. Make sure you take your medication on time."

"No need, I can go home by myself. Don't trouble yourself, William. See you later," Jennifer said, wanting to stay and watch Christina's misfortune but not wanting to leave a bad impression on William, so she left.

Christina finished registering.

She told Walter, "I'll go see the doctor now. You can leave."

"Okay," Walter said, leaving without noticing William nearby.

Once Walter was gone, William approached Christina, demanding, "Haven't you caused enough trouble with Walter? Do you really like him?"

If she didn't genuinely like him, William couldn't understand why Christina would be with Walter.

At the last family gathering, Gabrielle had been so harsh. If Christina had any self-awareness, she should have kept her distance from Walter.

Christina hated his accusatory tone.

Who she liked or didn't like was her own business. What did it have to do with William?

Did she have to report to him every day?

Thinking this, she didn't bother to be polite. "So what if I like him? What does it have to do with you? Just because we slept together, you think you can control me?"

William's face grew darker.

Christina was being reckless.

His eyes filled with danger. "If you had nothing to do with the Cavendish family, I wouldn't care what you did. But now, your actions affect the family!"

"My foot is injured, and he helped me register. How does that affect anything? Open your eyes and stop accusing me," Christina retorted, not believing he was concerned about the family.

"Did Jennifer cry to you, and now you feel sorry for her, so you came to pick a fight with me?"

"You and Walter together is something I saw with my own eyes. What does Jennifer have to do with it? Stop blaming her and reflect on yourself," William said, not finished.

Christina didn't want to listen or look at him anymore. If she couldn't confront him, she could at least avoid him.

She turned and walked away.

William quickly caught up. "Your foot's hurt, and you're still arguing with me? Last time at the Cavendish Mansion, I helped you when Gabrielle gave you trouble. Can't I say a few words to you?"

He just wanted Christina to keep her distance from Walter to avoid more trouble and prevent family chaos.

Who knew Christina's temper would be this bad?

"If you know I'm hurt, why are you bullying me? The doctor called my number. I need to see the doctor. Leave me alone," Christina said, walking quickly despite the pain.

Seeing she was really going to the doctor, William didn't follow.

Neither of them expected that today's events would be photographed, edited, and posted online with sensational headlines.

"Shocking! Forbidden Love of the Century!"

"True love only exists in the wealthy."

The news went viral, with an astonishing number of shares and comments. People had a lot to say.

"They really are a family now."

"Can you accept this forbidden love? How is this different from incest? It's against human decency."

"Who cares about old-fashioned views? They aren't related by blood. Why can't they be together?"

"If he married another woman, there might be mother-in-law issues. With them together, there won't be that problem. Both families know each other and won't bully them."

"Family relationships in wealthy families are so messy."

Nicholas soon saw the news online.

He read the comments from start to finish, growing angrier by the minute, and immediately called for Raymond and Elisa.

As soon as they entered, Nicholas grabbed a water cup from the table and threw it at Raymond.

He used all his strength. If it hit, Raymond would be bruised and battered!

Raymond quickly dodged, and the cup shattered on the floor.

"How dare you dodge?" Nicholas glared.

Despite his age, Raymond was still afraid of his father when he was angry. His voice lowered, "Dad, don't get angry. It's bad for your health."

"I don't want to be angry, but you all are trying to drive me to my grave! Did you see the nonsense online?"

Raymond nodded with a pained expression.

Of course, he saw it. He immediately contacted the PR team to handle it, trying to suppress the news.

But the public's interest was too high. Even if he spent money to remove the trending topic, people kept posting about it.

"Then why are you standing there? Get your daughter here," Nicholas slammed the table. "You two really raised a good daughter!"

At the Cavendish Mansion's birthday party, Nicholas had said the same thing.

But then, he meant it as a compliment. Now, it was sarcasm.

He never expected Christina to cause so much trouble for the Cavendish family, one problem after another.

###chapter 87 She Is Pregnant

"Yeah, yeah, I'll call her right now," Raymond stammered, not daring to cross Nicholas in his current mood.

He quickly dialed Christina's number.

Nicholas, finding the study too cramped, headed downstairs to wait in the living room.

By the time Christina arrived, Gabrielle and her family had also shown up.

Gabrielle had been holding a grudge since the last incident, and now that she had a chance to strike back at Christina, she wasn't going to miss it. She brought Walter along, hoping he'd see the mess Christina had made and stay away from her.

As soon as Christina walked in, she was met with a furious shout, "You can't go a single day without causing trouble! Look at the mess you've made!"

Nicholas's eyes blazed with anger.

The entire internet was buzzing with gossip about her and William. Even if he managed to suppress the news, people would remember. Whenever William got married, Christina's name would inevitably come up.

He regretted not sending Christina abroad sooner.

"Dad, don't get so worked up. It's not worth it," Gabrielle said, moving behind Nicholas to massage his shoulders. She seemed to be calming him down, but her words were incendiary. "Since things have blown up, why not just let them get married? We could turn this into a celebration, like the internet says, one big happy family."

"Married? Do you think the Cavendish family has no shame? You have a son too. If those two end up together, they'll be a laughingstock. How will your son find a wife then?" Nicholas's eyes flashed with anger again.

William and Christina weren't even in the same generation. If they were, he wouldn't have been so furious last time.

He thought making Christina take birth control would end the matter quietly. But now, the scandal was everywhere.

The internet was full of people who loved drama, with some even blessing their relationship. He couldn't understand how anyone could support such an inappropriate match.

"Dad, I'm just thinking of them. The rumors are out there, and we can't clear them up. So why not..." Gabrielle trailed off as Nicholas's glare grew more intense.

She shut her mouth, realizing it was better not to push her luck. Nicholas's anger was directed at Raymond's family, and she didn't want to become his next target.

Gabrielle continued massaging Nicholas's shoulders until she noticed Walter's grim expression. Alarm bells went off in her head.

She had suspected something between Walter and Christina before. A mother's intuition is rarely wrong, especially when it comes to her own child.

"This has nothing to do with you. Stay out of it," Nicholas snapped, clearly wanting Gabrielle and her family to leave.

Gabrielle, preoccupied with her own concerns, had no interest in watching Christina's downfall. Nicholas was adamant about keeping Christina and William apart, and now Walter seemed interested in Christina. If Christina ever shifted her attention to Walter, it would be chaos.

She needed to find Walter a girlfriend quickly and get him settled down.

Inside the house, Nicholas berated Christina before instructing the butler, "Prepare a room for her. She'll stay home and reflect on her actions. Make sure she gets her meals on time."

"Yes, sir," the butler replied, then turned to Christina. "Ms. Windsor, please follow me."

Christina understood Nicholas's intentions. He wanted to keep her confined at home to prevent further trouble.

But wasn't William more to blame for this mess? If he and Jennifer hadn't caused a scene, she would have returned to school after helping Mia, avoiding injury and the hospital encounter with William that led to the scandal.

Yet Nicholas only blamed her.

It made sense; William was his chosen successor and beloved grandson, while she was just an adopted daughter.

She didn't want to stay home, but she had no choice. She followed the butler to the guest room.

"Ms. Windsor, the sheets are freshly changed. Let me know if you need anything or have any meal preferences," the butler said politely.

Christina, feeling trapped, had no interest in making requests. "This is fine," she said curtly.

"I'll leave you then," the butler said, locking the door behind him.

Hearing the lock, Christina felt a mix of frustration and helplessness. She had no idea how long she'd be stuck there.

Elisa was still pleading with Nicholas to let Christina go. "Nicholas, if you trust me, I can take care of Christina."

"Why should I trust you? If you two could manage her, we wouldn't be in this mess," Nicholas retorted, refusing to let Christina leave.

Raymond, sensing Nicholas's firm stance, signaled Elisa to stop, but she was determined.

She took a deep breath and said, "Nicholas, Christina is pregnant."

The room fell silent, the tension palpable.

Nicholas stared at her in disbelief. "Elisa, repeat what you just said."

"Christina is pregnant," Elisa repeated, bracing herself for the fallout.

Raymond was shocked. He knew Christina had taken birth control after her encounter with William, so how could she be pregnant?

But Elisa insisted, "Nicholas, I wouldn't joke about this. Christina is my daughter, and I'm telling the truth. She's pregnant."

###chapter 88 Going to the Hospital for a Checkup

"Damn it!" Nicholas's anger was like a storm brewing.

Ever since he found out Christina and William had slept together, Nicholas had been on edge, worried Christina might get pregnant.

And of course, his worst fear came true.

"Elisa, I'm asking you one last time, are you sure Christina's pregnant?"

"I'm sure."

"Then what kind of mother are you!" If Elisa were his biological daughter, Nicholas would have slapped her already.

His eyes blazed with anger. "Do you know Christina is still a student? She hasn't even graduated yet. Since you knew she was pregnant, why didn't you take her to the hospital for an abortion? How can you be so irresponsible as a mother!"

Raymond, standing nearby, wasn't spared either.

After scolding Elisa, Nicholas turned to glare at him. "And you, as her father, I don't expect you to achieve great things, but at least handle your family's mess!"

Raymond was so scared he didn't dare to breathe, let alone talk back to Nicholas.

Seeing Nicholas's firm stance, showing no intention of keeping the baby, Elisa couldn't stay silent any longer.

"Dad, this isn't just Christina's problem. Christina is living in William's villa now. In my opinion, why not..."

She didn't finish her sentence, but her meaning was clear.

Since things had already escalated to this point, why not let William and Christina be together?

William was far better than Zachary. He was Nicholas's successor, and the entire Cavendish family would be his in the future.

If Christina could be with him, get married, and have children, their whole family could rely on William.

Previously, William wasn't interested in Christina, and the whole family strongly opposed it, so Elisa didn't dare to think about it.

But now things were different.

Rumors about Christina and William were everywhere, and the whole internet knew they had slept together. Some people were even starting to congratulate them.

Such a good opportunity, of course, she had to seize it and find the best husband for her daughter.

"Nonsense, they're uncle and niece!" Nicholas still wouldn't relent.

He immediately called William over and asked him in front of Elisa and Raymond, "I heard Christina has been staying at your place recently. Is that true?"

"Yes." William nodded.

Facing the grandfather who loved him the most, he would never lie. Besides, he had Christina stay over just to keep an eye on her. They were innocent, with nothing to hide.

"William, I raised you myself. You know better than anyone what your relationship with Christina is. I don't think you would do something so foolish. But Elisa just told me Christina is pregnant. What's going on?"

Nicholas wanted to get to the bottom of it.

Was it that Christina didn't take the contraceptive pill, or as Elisa said, did William have inappropriate feelings for her, and they couldn't control themselves?

At this moment, the butler brought Christina over.

She hadn't figured out what was happening when she saw William looking at her with cold eyes.

He sneered, "Christina, tell me, are you really pregnant?"

Before Christina could answer, William added, "In front of everyone here, you better tell the truth. Lies won't hold up forever."

Even if Christina could bribe one hospital, or even multiple hospitals, could she bribe every doctor in the world?

Lies would always come to light eventually.

Christina, already furious from being locked in the guest room, was even more enraged by his tone.

She wasn't so desperate as to lie about being pregnant for a man!

Even if William wanted to be with her, he would have to ask for her consent first.

She bluntly told him, "I'm not pregnant. And even if I were pregnant with your child, I'd get an abortion immediately and never let you know."

"Is that so? To be sure, let's go to the hospital. I don't want any 'surprises' a few months from now," William hinted.

Christina was so angry she could scream. "Fine, let's go. You contact the doctor and get it checked out."

She didn't want to be suspected and certainly didn't want any ties with William.

Elisa was almost frantic seeing her attitude, but with Nicholas there, she couldn't intervene and could only worry silently.

"We're going to the hospital today. William, you go with her and let me know the results immediately," Nicholas decided firmly.

William found a highly experienced specialist and took Christina for a blood test.

After the blood was drawn, Christina pressed on the wound and stood in the hallway with him, waiting for the results. "After today's test, can you finally be at ease?"

"If you don't cause any more trouble in the future."

"What do you mean, me causing trouble? William, are you out of your mind?" Christina's anger flared up again.

She was the innocent one here, for crying out loud.

"Isn't all this because of you? I was busy with my own things, and you and Jennifer jumped in. And you blame me for hurting her? Please, you two were the ones who came to me."

William's frown deepened. "I don't want to argue with you."

"I don't want to argue either, so let's get this test done. The doctor is someone you trust, so you'll be assured. Once it's confirmed I'm not pregnant, I won't need to stay at your villa anymore, and you can't use this as an excuse to restrict my freedom."

Christina had wanted to say this for a long time but hadn't found the right opportunity. Today was perfect to clear things up.

This way, she would have more time to focus on her own matters.

Staying away from William would also mean Jennifer wouldn't keep bothering her, solving two problems at once.

"Do you think I want to keep you around?" William scoffed. "I'd be glad if you weren't there."

"Great, it's a deal." Christina extended her hand for a handshake.

Neither of them noticed a man in a black trench coat and sunglasses not far away, snapping a photo of the scene.

He quickly sent the photo to Elisa.

Elisa was thrilled when she saw the photo: [Take more pictures and send them to me.]

"Elisa, what are you doing?" A familiar voice suddenly came from behind.

Elisa turned around to see Raymond standing there, frowning.

###chapter 89 The Unstoppable Greed of Human Nature

She patted her chest, "Why'd you show up outta nowhere? You scared the crap outta me."

"Why'd you have someone take this kind of photo?" Raymond's eyes were glued to the picture in front of him.

He was baffled, "Nicholas was already pissed today. If he finds out you had someone take this kind of photo, he might kick both of us out."

"But this is our only shot," Elisa didn't think she had done anything wrong.

She pulled Raymond to sit down and explained in detail, "Because I saw Nicholas's attitude, I have to strike while the iron's hot. If we squash those online rumors, Christina won't stand a chance."

"I originally wanted Christina to be with Zachary, but she messed it up herself. If I find her another date, what kind of person could I find? It's better to have her with William. Don't forget, the Cavendish family will eventually belong to William!"

Nicholas's attitude was already very clear.

He favored William alone. No matter how hard others tried, they might get a few more shares, but no one could surpass William.

Raymond was gradually convinced by her words.

When the day comes that Nicholas is gone, and he meets William, he would have to be respectful. But if Christina marries William, it would be completely different.

Then, he would instantly become William's father-in-law, reversing the relationship.

No matter what William did outside, as long as he came home, in front of him, William would always be a junior, beneath him.

Of course, he was tempted, but he also had to consider the reality, "You saw Nicholas's attitude. If he finds out we're doing all these things behind his back, we're done for."

"If you don't say anything and I don't say anything, how would Nicholas know? Raymond, I genuinely want to be with you and make our lives better," Elisa held his hand.

Human greed is unstoppable, and Raymond eventually nodded in agreement with her plan.

Meanwhile, Christina had just received her test results, which clearly stated she wasn't pregnant.

She threw the test results at William, "Take a good look. Now you can relax. I have no desire to have your child."

William scrutinized her.

If what she said matched what she felt, why did Grandpa call him so angrily, demanding he come over immediately to confront Christina?

Just then, Nicholas called.

William answered immediately, "Grandpa, I'm at the hospital now."

"Did the results come out?" Nicholas was most concerned about this, "Make sure you find a reliable doctor."

He was old now and couldn't handle such shocks.

"I found a friend, very reliable. The results are out. I'll send you the electronic version right now."

Christina took the opportunity to leave.

Once outside the hospital, breathing in the fresh air, she felt completely relaxed.

She would never have to go to William's villa again or face him.

Since it was still early, Christina planned to head back to school, but she got a call from Mia on the way. "Hey, are you free now? I'd love to treat you to coffee."

Christina happily agreed.

They met at the same coffee shop as before.

As soon as they met, Christina noticed Mia had lost weight. "Are you okay?"

Mia nodded first, then shook her head, tears welling up in her eyes.

She forced a smile. "I tell everyone I'm doing great, but it's a lie. Aiden and I have been together for so many years and have a lovely daughter, but he betrayed me and had an illegitimate child."

If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, she wouldn't have believed it if someone else told her.

Aiden's love for her had been an act all along.

And he had kept up the act for so many years.

Christina didn't know how to comfort her, so she just stayed by her side, listening. "At least you have your daughter. Kids naturally love their moms, and daughters are more empathetic."

Mentioning her child, Mia couldn't hold back her tears anymore.

She sniffled. "I wanted to kick him out with nothing, but he insists on custody and splitting the assets. These are things my parents left me. I can't just hand them over to him."

Why should such a bad man get away with it?

But if she didn't give him money, he would cling to the custody issue.

"Can you get a lawyer to fight it?" Christina suggested.

Mia sighed heavily. "I've already consulted a lawyer. We can fight it, but it could take years. Divorce laws are tough now."

Even if both parties agree to divorce, there's a cooling-off period. And in her case, Aiden was uncooperative.

"And I have to think about my daughter. If we make a big scene, and he says bad things to her, it would hurt her." Mia had considered everything.

Mothers are like that. They'd rather suffer themselves than let their children suffer.

Christina didn't know what to say.

Mia was wealthy, and her family supported her. Even so, dealing with a bad man was a headache.

For women without money or family support, it must be even harder!

"Let's not talk about these sad things. I asked you out because I wanted to tell you, I've finished demolishing the villa. I want you to help me design a playground for my daughter as a gift." Mia wiped her tears.

The divorce battle was her burden. Her daughter just needed to be happy.

"Even though the fault lies with Aiden, and he's not a good father, my daughter won't have a dad anymore. I hope she likes this gift."

Christina understood Mia's feelings.

She reassured her, "I'll design it entirely based on your daughter's preferences. Don't worry too much. You've done so much for her. Kids may be young, but they're not stupid. Your efforts will be rewarded."

###chapter 90 Meeting Aiden Again

"You're right, my daughter is very sensible. There's still half an hour before her preschool lets out. Why don't you come with me to pick her up? That way, she can tell you her ideas directly, and you can design based on what she wants," Mia said, glancing at the time.

They had just enough time.

If Mia acted as the go-between, it wouldn't be as effective as Christina talking to her daughter directly.

Christina agreed.

The two of them arrived at the preschool entrance. Before they even got out of the car, Mia spotted her daughter, Lily, standing next to a man-Aiden.

What was he doing here?

Mia's heart tightened. She quickly opened the car door and rushed over, pulling her daughter behind her.

She glared at Aiden, her voice trembling with anger. "What do you want?"

"Mia, Lily is our daughter. I'm her biological father. Isn't it normal for me to pick her up from school?" Aiden said with a smile.

Mia didn't let her guard down just because of a few words.

If he really cared about their daughter, he wouldn't have had an affair and fathered a child with another woman.

Besides, they were getting divorced. He never picked up their daughter before, and now he wanted to play the good father? It was laughable.

Ignoring him, Mia bent down to check on her daughter, adjusting her clothes. "Lily, tell Mommy, are you hurt?"

Lily shook her head.

She looked at her dad, then at her mom, and threw herself into Mia's arms, hugging her tightly. "Mommy, I want to go to the beach with you and Daddy."

Mia froze.

Last month, on the eighth, it was Lily's birthday. She had made a wish to go to the beach with both her parents.

Mia had planned to take her, but her own mother fell ill, and Aiden kept saying he had to work late. The plan got postponed, and now they were getting divorced.

She kissed Lily on the forehead. "Sweetie, how about Mommy takes you this weekend?"

"Mia, since she wants to go, let's go today. No need to wait until the weekend. I'll go with you," Aiden said eagerly.

Mia rolled her eyes. "No need."

"Mia, hear me out," Aiden insisted, pulling her aside.

Mia was both angry and anxious.

There were a lot of people at the school entrance, and Lily was so small. Without her parents by her side, what if a bad person took her?

Aiden was so selfish, always thinking only of himself, never considering their child.

"There's nothing to talk about. Let go of me!" If it weren't for the fact that Lily was there, Mia would have slapped him.

Christina quickly moved to stand by Lily, keeping an eye on her.

Seeing this, Mia felt a bit more at ease.

She didn't notice the flash of malice in Aiden's eyes.

Facing her, Aiden's eyes filled with tears. "I really want to get back together. If you don't want to take me back, let's part on good terms. I won't fight for custody."

"What are you up to now?" Mia didn't believe him for a second.

Her trust in him was completely gone, replaced by suspicion.

Just yesterday, Aiden had been demanding money, threatening to take their daughter if he didn't get it. Now he was talking about parting on good terms? She'd believe that when pigs fly.

"You don't have to think the worst of me. I really regret it," Aiden said, after a moment of mental preparation. "Bianca's son isn't mine. She tricked me and betrayed me."

"If you're looking for sympathy, you've come to the wrong person," Mia said coldly.

Bianca had been willing to be a mistress, so what wouldn't she do?

As for Aiden, he chose to betray their marriage and be with his mistress. The fact that he got what he deserved was just karma.

"I know I did wrong and hurt you deeply. You don't have to forgive me. But Lily is my only child. As her father, I want her to have a good life," Aiden said sincerely.

"I'll work hard and leave everything to Lily. As long as you don't remarry or have other children, I'll leave with nothing. Let's go to the beach tonight and create one last memory as a family. Please?"

Mia hesitated.

She didn't want anything to do with Aiden, but Lily had just said she wanted to go to the beach with both her parents.

Lily was so young. Fulfilling this wish and giving her a happy memory seemed like a good idea.

Mia hesitated for a moment but ultimately refused. "A memory today, and what about tomorrow? We have no future together. You won't see Lily again. Stop wasting your breath. I won't agree."

Aiden knew Mia well after all their years together and having a child. Her tone left no room for negotiation.

If that was the case, he would have to resort to his backup plan.

"Mia, are you really so heartless that you won't even give me one last memory?"

"The heartless one is you. I don't want to see you around Lily again. Even if we weren't getting divorced, I have ways to deal with you. I just don't want to make things ugly," Mia said, turning to leave.

She got in the car with Lily and Christina. As she drove, she asked her daughter, "Sweetie, what do you want for dinner?"

"I want a burger, Mommy. Can I?" Lily, though pampered, was polite and well-behaved.

Mia couldn't bear to refuse her adorable daughter.

"Of course, sweetie. This is Christina, the designer. Tell her your ideas, and she'll make them come true."

"Wow!" Lily exclaimed.

She was too young to understand much about renovations. She only knew that last time she visited, it was just a concrete floor, and next time it would be a fairy-tale wonderland.

Wasn't that magic?

She looked at Christina, clapping her hands. "Pretty lady, you can do magic! You can make my dreams come true."

Christina couldn't help but laugh.

###chapter 91 Kidnapping

Having such an adorable daughter already makes you a winner in life, so why is Aiden so unsatisfied?

Christina gently patted Lily's head. "Alright, sweetie, you gotta tell me everything you're thinking. The more details, the better my magic will work."

"Okay!" Lily nodded eagerly.

Lily then spilled out a flood of thoughts, and Christina jotted everything down, planning to draft a design tonight and show it to Lily tomorrow.

Soon, Mia parked the car outside a burger joint.

While ordering, she asked Christina, "Do you like burgers? If you do, I'll grab you one too. If not, we can check out some other takeout options. My treat today."

"A burger's fine," Christina replied. She wasn't a huge fan of fast food, but she didn't mind it once in a while.

Outside the burger joint, Aiden pointed inside. "Those three. Tie them up. As long as you get the job done, money won't be an issue."

Mia was an only child. Once she was out of the picture, all the family assets would go to Lily. And Aiden was Lily's biological father.

With all that wealth in his hands, he could do whatever he wanted.

"You've come to the right people. As long as the money's good, there's nothing we can't do," one of the men behind him chuckled.

They waited outside the burger joint, ready to follow Mia as soon as she came out.

Mia initially planned to drop Christina back at school, but halfway there, she remembered something. "How about you come home with me tonight? I want to renovate the house I'm living in now. I don't want any traces of Aiden left."

"Mommy, isn't Daddy coming home tonight?" Lily suddenly asked.

Mia thought her daughter missed her father and was racking her brain for an explanation when Lily continued, "Daddy's so weird. He said he was going to apologize to you tonight and wanted me to help him, but now he's nowhere to be seen."

"Lily, did you really want to go to the beach with Mommy and Daddy, or did Daddy tell you to say that?" Mia tried to keep her emotions in check.

Lily replied, "Daddy told me to say that. He said you two had a fight, and he regretted it. He wanted me to help make you happy."

At that moment, Mia's tears flowed uncontrollably.

Thank goodness she hadn't softened earlier. Aiden was truly despicable.

Taking a deep breath, Mia told Christina, "Not just the villa we're living in now, but any house he's ever been in-I want them all renovated. Ms. Windsor, I'm counting on you."

Christina was almost dizzy from the sudden windfall.

Just from Mia alone, she stood to make a fortune!

With money on the line, she was all in. "I'll come home with you tonight. I can take measurements for the renovation."

Mia's villa was in the suburbs, and it was already dark, with few cars on the road.

Halfway there, a car suddenly rammed into them from behind.

Mia quickly got out to check the situation, but before she could say anything, someone covered her mouth and dragged her into a car.

Another man knocked on Christina's window. "Hey, get out and see what you did to our car. The headlights are completely wrecked."

Christina sensed something was off.

But the man quickly opened the car door and sprayed a sedative mist in her face.

A wave of dizziness hit her.

Christina wanted to call the police, but she didn't even have the strength to reach for her phone. Her head slumped, and she passed out.

When she woke up, she found herself tied to a chair, with Mia beside her and the vast ocean behind them.

They were on a ship's deck!

"Ms. Mia Wilson? Wake up," Christina called softly.

Mia soon opened her eyes. Realizing their predicament, she struggled desperately to free herself from the ropes.

Just then, Aiden approached with a lantern, Bianca by his side.

With no one else around, Aiden dropped all pretense, his eyes filled with malice. "I was going to spare you, but you had to be shameless and break with me. Now neither of you will live!"

"Let Ms. Windsor go. She has nothing to do with this. Where's Lily?" Mia hadn't finished speaking when Aiden burst into laughter.

He grabbed Mia's face. "You should worry about yourself. Neither of you will live. Don't worry, I'll let Lily live a few more years."

"If your daughter dies too soon, who will take care of my son?" Bianca walked over, smug.

Not only could she take Mia's place, but she could also transfer all of Mia's wealth to her own son.

It was a dream come true for her. "Don't worry, I'll let your daughter live a couple more years. Once we transfer all your assets, we'll send your whole family to hell."

"Aiden, how could you be such a bastard?" Mia trembled all over.

She never imagined that marrying Aiden, the wrong man, would bring such disaster to her family.

"For the sake of our marriage, I beg you, don't harm my family."

"Your parents still don't trust me and won't hand over the company. They deserve it," Aiden said, feeling no remorse.

Bianca urged him, "Stop wasting time. Kill her quickly so we can leave. I don't want to end up in jail if someone sees us."

"Don't worry. It's pitch dark, and there are no cameras at sea. If the police ask, we'll say Mia fell into the sea trying to save her daughter and got eaten by sharks. No evidence, no case. Who will know the truth?" Aiden said smugly.

He had already thought of everything and was confident nothing would go wrong.

But Bianca was still uneasy. "Hurry up and throw them overboard. The sooner, the better. Then I'll tell the captain to head back."

"I know."

Aiden walked over to the two women.

He grinned wickedly and reached for Mia. Mia screamed in despair, and Christina called out desperately.

The louder they screamed, the more pleasure Aiden felt. "Scream all you want. Do you think anyone will come to save you?"

Using his strength, he dragged the chair-bound Mia to the edge of the deck and pushed her overboard, chair and all.

Next, it was Christina's turn.

Aiden didn't push her immediately. Instead, he reached out and touched her face.

###chapter 92  What Is This Situation?

Young women are different; their skin is so smooth and tender.

Aiden had only touched her a few times before he started having wicked thoughts. "I heard you're still a student. It'd be such a waste if you died now. How about you become my mistress? I won't kill you then."

Christina didn't want to die, but she definitely didn't want to get involved with a man like him.

Being his mistress would be worse than death.

"Aiden, what are you doing?" Bianca, who had just walked into the cabin, came back out, looking displeased. "The captain is ready to head back. Hurry up."

Aiden felt a pang of regret for not getting Christina, but he couldn't admit his intentions in front of Bianca.

He dragged Christina to the side of the deck and forcefully pushed her over the edge. "Go to hell!"

A sudden light shone on his face.

Aiden's expression changed from menacing to panicked. How could there be another boat nearby?

Had someone seen him committing the crime?

No, he had to think of something.

"Shit!"

Joseph lowered his flashlight, his mouth agape. "Guess what I just saw?"

"A murder?" William said offhandedly.

Joseph nodded vigorously. "Not just a murder, but someone we know. You know Christina, right?"

Even though Joseph didn't like Christina, if she got yelled at, he'd probably clap along. But seeing her pushed into the sea was a matter of life and death.

No matter their past issues, saving her was the priority.

He tossed William's fishing rod aside. "Stop fishing and call the Coast Guard. We need to get over there and save her."

"You're the one who dragged me out here for night fishing, and now you're saying to stop." William was both amused and annoyed. "Don't tell me you saw Christina committing murder."

No matter how outrageous Christina was, she wouldn't commit murder.

Joseph slapped his thigh. "She didn't kill anyone. She was tied to a chair and pushed into the sea. If we don't get there soon, she'll be shark food!"

William's expression changed.

Joseph was a doctor; he wouldn't joke about something like this. Christina was really in danger.

"I'll start the boat. You call for help and get more people. We need to save her first." Joseph quickly headed to the cockpit.

He revved the engine and steered the boat towards where Christina had fallen.

Aiden was now completely panicked, his hands and feet trembling uncontrollably. "What do we do? They're coming over."

"Let's just kill them all," Bianca suggested.

Before she could finish, Aiden slapped her hard across the face.

"This isn't like killing chickens. It's murder! I don't even know how many people are on that boat, and murder is illegal!" Aiden was furious. He had already killed Mia and Christina. That was two lives.

If he killed more people, it would be a major crime. The police would get involved, and they wouldn't be able to escape.

He could face the death penalty!

"What do we do then? We can't just stand here and wait for them to take us to the police. I want our son to have a good life, not become an orphan." Bianca was on the verge of tears.

She was truly regretting it now.

If she had known, she would have let Mia live a bit longer, tricked her into going abroad, and let her die quietly there.

"Let's head back. We'll create an alibi. That person probably didn't see my face clearly. Let's go back." Aiden clung to the hope that the person hadn't seen him clearly.

Bianca, equally panicked, ran to inform the captain to turn back.

By the time Joseph's boat arrived, they had already fled far away.

"They think they can run after committing a crime? In this day and age, with big data, they'll be caught in no time." Joseph sneered at the retreating boat.

He decided to let them go for now. The police would catch up with them eventually, and they'd face justice.

For now, he and William needed to save Christina.

"Christina was tied to a chair and thrown into the sea. She must be at the bottom by now. You stay on the boat; I'll go down." William took off his jacket, grabbed a diving flashlight, and jumped into the water.

Joseph anxiously waited on the boat.

He wanted to help search, but he knew staying on the boat was the best way to support William.

Christina was on the brink of suffocation.

She couldn't believe that after being given a second chance at life, she was going to die silently in the deep sea.

She couldn't accept her fate.

But the chair leg was stuck in a rock crevice, and her hands were tightly bound. She couldn't muster any strength. She could only wait for death.

Suddenly, a light shone in her vision. William swam towards her quickly, circled behind her, and cut the ropes on her wrists with a sharp knife. Then he grabbed her and swam towards the surface.

Soon, they both broke through the water's surface.

Christina greedily gulped in the fresh air.

"Do you have any strength left? If you do, grab the rope, and I'll pull you up." Joseph had tied a knot in the boat's rope and threw it to her.

Christina looked up and saw it was him!

Joseph sarcastically remarked, "Ms. Windsor, at a time like this, you wouldn't still want me to leave, would you?"

"Let me remind you, there aren't many people night fishing. In your current state, you won't last long. If you miss us, you'll really be left to die in the sea."

Christina wouldn't let their past issues make her give up her life.

She quickly grabbed the rope.

"You grabbed that pretty fast." Joseph said, but his hands didn't stop moving.

He and William, who was already on the boat, pulled her up quickly.

Once they confirmed Christina was out of danger, Joseph wanted to mock her.

But before he could, Christina urgently pointed to the sea. "You need to save someone else. Another person was thrown into the sea, also tied to a chair. If we delay any longer, she might not make it."

Mia had been in the water much longer than she had!

Joseph's face turned serious. "What's going on? William, take care of her. I'm going down."

"You're the doctor. You stay here." William said, already jumping into the water.

###chapter 93 They All Survived

The cold wind whipped around, and Christina couldn't stop shivering, sneezing one after another.

But she couldn't care less about herself right now. All her attention was glued to the horizon, hoping that William would emerge with Mia any second.

As the minutes ticked by with no sign of anyone, her anxiety grew.

Joseph's face was just as grim. He didn't even have the heart to mock her. He didn't want anything bad to happen to Mia, who had been thrown into the water, and he certainly didn't want anything to happen to William.

Just as Joseph was about to take off his shirt and dive in to see what was going on, William finally surfaced.

He took a couple of deep breaths and shouted to Joseph, "Throw the rope! She's out cold."

Joseph quickly tossed down the rope he had prepared.

William immediately looped the rope around Mia and pushed her up with all his strength.

Christina rushed over to help, and together with Joseph, they pulled Mia onto the boat.

Mia's eyes were closed, and her body was ice-cold.

"Mia? Wake up, please wake up," Christina kept shaking her, trying to rouse her.

Joseph pushed her aside, saying, "I'm a doctor. Let me handle this. I need to perform CPR."

With lives on the line, Christina stepped back immediately.

She prayed silently, over and over, for God to save Mia. What would happen to Lily if Mia didn't make it? Lily was so young, and her biological father was a jerk who didn't truly care for her. If her mother died, she might not lack money, but she would lack protection.

And what about Mia's parents? Losing a daughter in middle age would be a devastating blow that most people couldn't bear.

Joseph performed CPR on Mia. When it was time for mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, he looked at William, then at Christina. "Don't just stand there. Come over and do the mouth-to-mouth."

"Me?"

"Is there anyone else here? Don't tell me you don't know how to do it." Before Joseph could finish his sentence, Christina was already kneeling beside Mia.

She wasn't a professional doctor, but she wasn't completely ignorant either.

With Joseph's guidance, Mia finally coughed up the water she had swallowed and started breathing on her own.

But she was still very weak, unable to speak.

"I'll carry you to the cabin to rest. You're soaked through and need to warm up quickly. I'm a doctor, and you can trust me," Joseph said, lifting her in his arms.

Mia, having just come back from the brink of death, was terrified. The person who had pushed her into the water was her husband, and she couldn't trust this stranger.

Was he really a doctor, or was he another tormentor sent by Aiden?

"Ms. Mia Wilson, please rest. These two are my friends," Christina's words reassured her, and she stopped resisting.

The cabin wasn't far, just a few steps away. Joseph cranked the air conditioning to the highest setting and opened a medical kit, dropping a packet into a kettle. "Drink this once the water boils. It'll help prevent a cold."

"Thank you," Mia said, feeling a bit better in the warm air. She asked Joseph, "How much do I owe you for the emergency treatment and this hot water? Give me your account number, and I'll transfer the money right now."

"I don't want your money. It's my duty to save lives. Just don't sue me," Joseph said, half-jokingly.

Mia quickly explained, "I would never do that. You saved my life. If I sued you, that would be ungrateful."

"I was just kidding. There's hot water in the bathroom. Take a shower, and there's a robe in the closet. If you feel unwell, come find me," Joseph said before leaving.

On the deck, the night wind blew, and Christina felt colder and colder.

Suddenly, she felt warmth on her back.

William had draped his jacket over her. "Go take a shower, change clothes, and let Joseph check you out."

"What about you?" Christina asked, looking at him.

Under the light, water dripped from William's hair, running down his abs and disappearing into his pants.

She wasn't overly worried about William, but he had just saved her and Mia. She felt she should show some concern for her rescuer.

"I don't need you to worry about me. Just take care of yourself. Go shower. Do I have to beg you?" William clearly didn't want to argue.

Christina turned and walked to the cabin.

Inside, she found the cabin larger than she had expected, with more than two rooms.

She quickly showered, changed into a robe from the closet, and hung her wet clothes by the air vent to dry.

Just as she finished, there was a knock on the door.

Christina hurried to open it, finding Joseph standing there.

He looked her over, seeing that her color had returned to normal. She seemed fine.

With that settled, he could finally mock her.

He raised an eyebrow. "Ms. Windsor, what is this? Are you going to shut me out again?"

"Please come in," Christina said, stepping aside.

Joseph wasn't ready to let her off easily.

He leaned against the doorframe, not moving. "Ms. Windsor says 'please come in,' but where's the sincerity? Last time we met, you were so tough. What happened now?"

His tone was infuriating.

Christina gritted her teeth, deciding to let it go since Joseph had saved her today. "If you don't want to come in, I'll close the door."

"I'm the only doctor on this boat, and we won't be docking anytime soon. If you send me away now, you'll be begging me later," Joseph said, holding the door to keep it open.

He had come to vent his frustration. If he left now, he'd be letting Christina off too easily.

Besides, William had asked him to check on Christina, and he had agreed. He had to keep his promise.

Christina was both angry and helpless. "What do you want? I'm not going to beg you to come in."

###chapter 94 Deliberate Difficulties

The best she could do was stop thinking about those unpleasant memories, but to lower herself and grovel? No way.

Joseph clicked his tongue. "Chill out, I'm not that twisted. I just want you to invite me in. You should show some respect to medical personnel, right? How about this, call me a kind and handsome guy?"

Christina really wanted to punch that smug face of his.

How could he be such a jerk?

She fought the urge, gritting her teeth as she spat out, "Don't push it."

Kind? Where?

If he were truly kind, her Harper wouldn't have suffered so much in their past life!

"I was just joking. Do you really need to be so serious?" Joseph's mood improved seeing her anger.

He walked right in, placing the medical kit on the table, then motioned for Christina to come over. "I'll draw some blood first, then check your heart rate and overall condition."

Christina was highly skeptical of his words.

The medical tools on the boat were limited, and if he could check her heart rate, why was there a need for a blood draw?

"I don't want to give blood," Christina thought, and directly refused him.

Joseph had been looking forward to poking her with a needle.

Now she refused? That wouldn't do.

He looked up, speaking righteously, "Who's the doctor here, you or me? You need to listen to me. If I say you need to give blood, you must. No objections."

Last time at William's villa, Joseph had others hold Christina down.

Now, with just the two of them in the room, he couldn't exactly go out and fetch William for this. He needed a way to make Christina give in on her own.

"That woman next door, Mia, she's your friend, right?" Joseph quickly thought of a plan.

He smiled even more broadly. "I was planning to check on her after examining you. She inhaled a lot of water and was struggling to breathe earlier. Who knows how she is now? If you don't cooperate, we can just sit here and wait."

After all, he wasn't the one in a hurry.

Christina was furious at his despicable behavior.

If she could hire another doctor, no matter the cost, she would. She didn't want to deal with Joseph.

But here, money was useless, and Joseph knew it, so he made things difficult for her.

"Fine, draw the blood," Christina finally relented.

She sat across from Joseph, extending her arm.

Joseph rummaged through the medical kit, finally selecting the thickest needle. He deliberately missed her vein, then twisted the needle under her skin. "Oops, missed the vein. Shall we try again?"

Just then, William walked in, immediately recognizing Joseph's intentional act.

Joseph was an expert; he wouldn't make such a basic mistake.

And such a thick needle was usually for burly men in hospitals.

"I missed your vein again. Maybe the room's too dark, and I can't see your veins," Joseph continued to lie.

Christina turned her head away, refusing to acknowledge him.

William stepped in to stop Joseph. "If you're that bored, why not grab a fishing rod and go fish?"

"Alright, alright, I won't poke her anymore," Joseph immediately backed off.

He gave William a knowing look. "We're friends, after all. If you care about her, I'll cooperate."

They'd known each other for years, and William never had other women around.

Plenty of women tried to get close to him, but none succeeded.

Except Christina.

Though they were technically uncle and niece, Joseph didn't care about such details. As long as there was no blood relation, being happy together was what mattered. Why give up true love for others' opinions?

"Joseph, don't say such things," William's frown deepened.

Their previous scandal had made headlines, and it took a lot of effort from his grandfather to suppress it. He didn't want to hear such talk now.

Christina felt the same. "Just draw the blood and stop talking."

Not every woman wanted to be Mrs. Cavendish.

She despised that title.

William should be with Jennifer, not causing trouble for others.

"Fine, I'll stop. I'll draw the blood, check your heart rate, then see the other patient," Joseph put aside his teasing.

He didn't want to intrude on them any longer.

As soon as he touched Christina's pulse, Joseph sensed something wrong. He felt her forehead, which was burning hot.

"You're running a fever. Dry your hair completely, then lie down and sweat it out. Here's some fever medicine, take it with warm water," Joseph quickly found the medication.

Taking her temperature was William's job.

Using the infrared thermometer was simple. He aimed it at Christina's forehead, and it quickly showed 103.5°F, a high fever.

"Get a good night's sleep. If your fever isn't down by morning, we'll head back," William decided.

He had planned to meet an international client for a big project tomorrow afternoon, but a life was more important.

He couldn't let Christina's fever worsen. What if she ended up with brain damage?

Then the Cavendish family would have to care for her forever.

"Make sure your hair is dry before sleeping, and keep the windows closed," Joseph advised before leaving.

He suddenly remembered, if Christina had a fever, Mia might too.

He couldn't care for two patients alone.

So Christina would have to rely on William.

After Joseph left, Christina stood to get the hairdryer but collapsed after a few steps.

Just as she thought she'd hit the floor, an arm wrapped around her waist.

"You're sick. Don't move. Sit still," William guided her back to the chair.

"But I need to dry my hair."

"I'll do it," William retrieved the hairdryer, set it to warm, and patiently dried Christina's hair.

###chapter 95  Deep in the Nightmare

Christina was already feeling miserable with a fever, her whole body burning up, and the hot wind blowing over her didn't help.

She couldn't help but tug at her collar. "Can't you switch the hairdryer to cool air?"

"No way. You're sick right now. If you catch a chill, you'll get even worse. Do you really want to die out here on the ocean?" William shot back.

"I jumped into the sea in the middle of the night to save your life. Even if you don't care about yourself, I don't want my efforts to go to waste."

Christina knew he had a point.

But she was so uncomfortable and just wanted to cool down.

"I'll put a cooling patch on your forehead. Once your hair is dry, you can lie down, and I'll use some alcohol to wipe your limbs. It'll help you feel better. Just hang in there; your hair's almost dry."

William's hand moved through her hair as he placed the cooling patch on her forehead.

Christina immediately felt a wave of coolness wash over her brain.

She felt much better and slumped over the table, half-asleep.

William finished drying her hair and set the hairdryer aside. "Your hair's dry now. I'll help you to bed so you can sleep."

"Okay," Christina mumbled.

She quickly fell asleep once she was in bed. William sat by her side for a while, and seeing that she was stable, he got up to leave.

But just as he reached the bedroom door, he heard Christina mumbling behind him.

"Harper, my Harper."

At first, William thought she was hallucinating from the fever and wanted some candy called "Harper." He searched the room but found nothing. "There's no candy on the boat. If you really want some, you'll have to wait until we get to shore."

It was the middle of the night, and they were out at sea. He couldn't exactly order delivery, and giving her a handful of sugar from the kitchen didn't seem right.

Christina didn't respond.

She was deep in a nightmare, unable to hear anything around her.

In her dream, her daughter was gravely ill, with a fever nearing 104°F.

As a mother, she was frantic, taking her daughter to every hospital, finally begging William for help.

She was utterly desperate, willing to give up everything for Harper's life. She knelt before him, her pride reduced to nothing.

"Please, save our daughter. If Harper gets better, I promise to leave with her and never show up in your life again. I only want her, just her."

There was one thing she didn't say out loud.

William was Harper's biological father. No matter how much he disliked Christina, he couldn't just watch his daughter die, could he?

But William did just that, watching Harper get sicker without lifting a finger.

He even accused Christina of lying. "Christina, I don't like your tricks. Stop wasting your time."

"But I'm not lying. If I am, may I die a horrible death. You can punish me however you want, but please, just look at Harper!" Christina was truly desperate.

She pushed Harper in front of William. "Even if you don't believe me, can't you trust the doctors? You can take Harper for a check-up. After that, you need to get her treated. William, I'm begging you."

Finally, William seemed to waver.

Just when she thought her daughter might be saved, Jennifer walked in. "William, don't let Christina fool you."

"I'm not lying!"

"Not lying? Harper is so young. If she were really sick, she'd be crying and fussing, not standing here quietly. You bribed the doctor to lie for you. How could you use your own child like this?"

Jennifer stood there, pointing at her with disdain.

Christina kept explaining, but it didn't matter. William didn't believe her.

In the end, they left, leaving her alone with Harper. Harper, ever the understanding child, wiped her tears and said, "Mommy, don't cry."

Christina's tears fell like a broken string of pearls.

She cried out loud in her dream, and in reality, tears streamed down her face. William grabbed some tissues from the bedside table and gently wiped her tears.

Christina kept calling out for Harper.

It was clear now that Harper was a person, not a candy brand.

But who was Harper?

William was sure he'd never heard the name before. Given Christina's current state, Harper was clearly very important to her.

With Christina talking in her sleep and running a high fever, he couldn't just wake her up to ask. He could only stay by her side.

Meanwhile, Mia wasn't doing well either.

After her bath, she too had a fever, though not as severe.

"Did you drink the cold medicine I made for you?" Joseph asked after taking her temperature and giving her some fever medicine.

Mia nodded after taking the medicine. "I need to get off this boat."

"We're not docked yet."

"I know, but I have an emergency. I need to get off immediately. If it delays your trip, I'll pay for it." Mia tried to solve the problem with money.

But neither Joseph nor William needed money.

Besides, they had a big client meeting the next day. If the deal went through, it would bring them a huge profit. No amount of money Mia offered could compare.

"And we're far from shore. It's pitch black out. Can't it wait? Or maybe you can contact friends or family to help?" Joseph suggested.

Mia shook her head. "I need to find my daughter. My ex-husband threw us into the sea, trying to kill us. Now that his plan failed, I'm afraid he'll hurt her. I can't wait."

Anything else could wait, but not her child's life.

She was feeling better and ready to find her daughter.

Mia started to leave.

"Calm down," Joseph said, blocking her. "Wait a bit longer. The police should be here soon. We called them when we rescued you, but it's taking time because we're far from shore."

###chapter 96 Are You So Interested in My Affairs?

When Mia heard the police were coming, she finally agreed to wait a bit longer.

But she didn't have to wait long. The coast guard arrived, assessed the situation, and then took her back to give a statement.

Before leaving, Mia asked about Christina, "Is Ms. Windsor okay? Is she coming with me to give a statement, or is she staying on the boat?"

"She's still running a fever. It'll probably break by tomorrow morning. She can give her statement once she's feeling better," Joseph replied, though he hadn't checked on Christina himself.

William hadn't left Christina's room, which meant either her fever was severe, or they had something important to discuss. Either way, Joseph didn't want to intrude.

"Alright, I'll contact her once she's awake," Mia said, turning to leave.

She needed to find her child first, then take Aiden to court and put that scumbag in jail, along with his mistress. Neither of those murderers would escape justice.

Joseph took a nap in his room until dawn, then went to check on Christina.

"Her fever's mostly gone, it's down to 100.4°F. Let her sleep a bit longer. I'll go check on the project plan," William said, clearly having stayed up all night by her side.

Since Christina's fever had broken, there was no need to head back immediately. They could wait until after their meeting with the client.

Joseph was worried about William's health. "It's still early. You should get some rest, even if it's just for a couple of hours. I'll watch over Christina. I'm a doctor, you should listen to me."

After some convincing, William agreed to rest.

Christina drifted in and out of consciousness. When she opened her eyes and saw the unfamiliar surroundings, she tried to get up but was too weak. She saw Joseph nearby and instinctively tried to rise, but her body ached, and she fell back asleep.

Some time later, William returned.

Seeing Christina still unconscious, William frowned. "Why isn't she awake yet? Why is it so serious this time?"

Joseph was equally puzzled. "I wish I knew why it's so severe. Since her fever hasn't fully broken, we should head to a hospital onshore for an IV."

The boat's medical facilities were limited.

William agreed and ordered the boat to head to shore as quickly as possible. But before they got far, they were stopped.

A massive luxury yacht blocked their path.

"This area is reserved by our duke. You'll have to go around," a burly man on a small submarine announced.

They were surrounded by several yachts, each manned by tall, imposing figures in black suits, clearly well-trained.

William wasn't intimidated, but with only himself, Joseph, and Mia on board, he didn't want to start trouble.

William contacted the coast guard.

The coast guard informed him, "There's no reserved area in these waters, but that yacht did notify us in advance. Given your emergency, we'll escort you."

With the coast guard's help, they quickly reached the shore.

William and Joseph immediately took Christina to the hospital.

Before they left, Mia told William, "When Christina wakes up, tell her to call me."

At the hospital, Christina was given an IV.

Joseph left William and Christina alone. Not long after, Christina woke up. Seeing William by her side felt ironic to her.

In her past life, she had longed for this moment, but now it was happening?

"Wouldn't it be better for you if I died?" Christina said sarcastically, unable to forget many things.

William frowned. "It would be better, but I can't just ignore it when I see it. After all, you did call me 'Uncle' once."

William hadn't expected Christina to be so ungrateful.

"Well, thank you. I won't owe you any favors."

Christina made it clear she wanted no contact with William.

"You already owe me. You really are something, always causing trouble," William said coldly, with a hint of disdain.

Christina sneered, "I think I'm pretty unlucky, always running into you."

"Who's Harper?"

William hadn't forgotten Christina mentioning this name, a child's name.

Christina had no close contacts at the Cavendish family or school. He hadn't had time to investigate, but Christina had changed. Her work in the architecture institute, her participation in art competitions, and her designs-when had she learned all this?

If it weren't the 21st century, he might have suspected she was possessed.

"Why are you so interested in my business?" Christina smirked. "William, do you actually like me?"

"What nonsense are you talking about? I just think..."

Before William could finish, his phone rang. It was Bob. "Mr. Cavendish, you need to come to the office."

"Alright."

Bob wouldn't call unless it was urgent.

William glanced at the weak Christina. "I have to go to the office. If you need anything, ask Joseph. And Mia said to call her when you wake up."

Christina didn't respond.

William left.

She didn't watch him go.

She didn't follow William's advice to find Joseph. After her IV, she got some medication from the doctor and left.

She texted Mia to let her know she was safe.

Then she checked into a hotel and rested for seven days until she fully recovered. After that, she went to the architecture institute.

This was a job she hadn't experienced in her past life, and she wasn't going to give it up. She went about her routine, eating, drinking, and working as usual.

Mia brought news that Aiden and Bianca had been sentenced. Mia even wanted her to be the design director, but Christina was committed to her job at the architecture institute. Taking the director position would mean giving up her current job, which she wasn't willing to do.

The architecture institute was a rare, stable job she couldn't afford to lose.

Kaitlyn hadn't been to the institute for days, and Christina was worried.

###chapter 97  Today It's My Turn to Invite You

Kaitlyn was always so full of energy; it wasn't like her to just vanish for days. Could what happened that night have really shaken her up that much?

No matter what, Christina had to check on her.

She headed straight to Kelvin's house. Since she was one of Kelvin's students, the housekeeper let her in without a second thought.

Kelvin was coming down the stairs and let out a deep sigh when he saw her. "Oh, it's you."

"I haven't seen Kaitlyn at the architecture school for days, so I came to check on her. How is she?" Christina asked, clearly worried.

Kelvin sighed even more heavily. "Ever since her birthday, she's been in bed, totally down. She doesn't want to go anywhere!"

Christina had a pretty good idea of what was going on. "I'll go up and see her."

"Good, you two are the closest," Kelvin said, relieved, and let her go upstairs.

Christina quietly went up the stairs.

Kaitlyn was alone in her room, lying in bed. Christina tiptoed in. "Still sleeping?"

Kaitlyn heard the noise, lifted her head to glance at Christina, then quickly lay back down, covering herself with the blanket without a word.

"I heard from Mr. Fisher that you're sick," Christina said, walking over quickly.

"Leave me alone," Kaitlyn mumbled from under the covers, clearly not wanting to see anyone.

Christina sighed and asked softly, "Are you mad at me?"

Kaitlyn's muffled voice came from under the blanket. "No."

Compared to how she used to treat Christina, this silent treatment wasn't really anger.

Christina gently patted her shoulder. "It's no fun staying cooped up like this. How about we go out for a bit? You used to drag me out all the time; today, let me invite you."

She didn't want to bring up Stanley, as it was an awkward situation for her.

Kaitlyn still didn't respond.

Unable to persuade her, Christina had no choice but to leave the room.

This wasn't an illness; it was a broken heart, and Christina couldn't do much about that.

As Christina left, Kelvin was waiting nearby, looking concerned. "How is she? Any better?"

Christina shook her head seriously. "Maybe giving her some time alone would be best."

Kelvin understood and didn't press further. Instead, he smiled and invited her. "Would you like to see my study?"

Christina gladly accepted, smiling and nodding. "Sure."

Kelvin's study was large, filled with meticulously crafted architectural models, each brick and tile carefully considered.

Christina took a thorough look around and then turned back, surprised. "Are these models based on real buildings? The structures inside seem identical."

Kelvin, generous as always, waved his hand and smiled. "Pick one, and I'll give it to you."

"Just seeing them is wonderful enough. I couldn't possibly accept a gift from Mr. Fisher," Christina said modestly, continuing her tour.

On another wall hung many old photographs, some faded with time, showing a younger Kelvin standing proudly in front of various historic buildings.

Kelvin walked over, smiling as he explained. "Back then, I had an entire team. We traveled the world, restoring many ancient buildings. Those were tough times, but they were also very fulfilling. It's a shame that feeling is gone now."

"Kelvin, you've dedicated your life to architecture, contributing so much. Even now, with students all over the world, you're still making a difference. Why speak so sadly?" Christina said earnestly.

Her words struck a chord with Kelvin, who laughed heartily. "I didn't expect you to be so eloquent. You're quite impressive."

"You're making me blush. I'm just speaking the truth," Christina said, touching her hair shyly.

As she glanced at the old photos again, preparing to look at the detailed models, her eyes caught something that made her freeze.

In the midst of the old photos, she saw a familiar face, one she had longed to see but thought she never would again.

Excitedly, she pointed at the person. "Kelvin, do you remember this man?"

Kelvin came over, squinting to recognize the face, then nodded, a bit wistfully. "Of course, I remember. He was one of my most talented students."

"Was he your student?" Christina was overjoyed.

"Yes, but sadly, I heard he passed away young. The architectural world lost a great talent," Kelvin said, almost choking up.

Wiping away his tears, he suddenly realized how odd Christina's question was and looked at her with wide eyes. "Why do you ask about him? Wait, he also had the last name Windsor. Are you..."

"Yes, he was my father. He passed away when I was very young," Christina said sadly. "I didn't know much about him, but seeing his photo here and learning he was your student feels like fate."

Kelvin was deeply moved. "Indeed, fate is a strange thing. You two are truly father and daughter, both exceptional in architecture."

"I got into this field because of my father's influence," Christina said, smiling as she recalled the past.

Kelvin laughed heartily. "Both of you being my students is a rare fate we must cherish."

"Absolutely," Christina nodded slightly.

As they were talking, Kaitlyn suddenly appeared at the door, her hair disheveled.

Kelvin quickly went to her. "You said you weren't feeling well. Why are you up?"

Kaitlyn sighed deeply, looking worn out. "Lying down was tiring too. Grandpa, I'm feeling better. Don't worry about me."

"What's really going on?" Kelvin asked, concerned.

Kaitlyn glanced at Christina, feeling embarrassed, and didn't want to say much. She just shook her head lightly.

"Alright, you're grown up now, with your own thoughts. If you don't want to talk to me, that's fine. Just take care of yourself and don't make me worry," Kelvin sighed. Just as he was about to say more, the phone on his desk rang.

He answered it, then said seriously, "Do I need to come in person?"

After a few words from the other end, he nodded. "Alright, I'll come and take a look."

###chapter 98 What Do You Really Want

Once Kelvin left, Kaitlyn finally glanced at Christina. "What happened at the birthday party wasn't your fault. I didn't mean to get mad at you, it's just..."

It was surprising how much Kaitlyn had matured in just a few days.

Christina coughed lightly. "You okay?"

"Honestly, I'm really sad and upset. I don't get it. Why doesn't he like me?" Kaitlyn's expression turned dejected again as she spoke.

Christina tried to comfort her. "You're more than good enough. Sometimes, when someone doesn't like another person, it's not because there's something wrong with them. It's just that they're not a good match. Kaitlyn, if you and he can't be together, I hope you can gradually let go of these feelings."

"Do you think you'll end up with him?" Kaitlyn asked, looking at Christina seriously.

Christina chuckled and replied sincerely, "I only see him as an upperclassman. Besides, I probably won't be thinking about relationships for a long time."

"Really?" Kaitlyn looked at her, still unsure.

"Of course. I fully support you in pursuing true love, but sometimes he might not be the right one for you," Christina advised.

She could see that Kaitlyn was straightforward and sincere, bright and cheerful, while Stanley was a bit reserved and might not understand her feelings.

Kaitlyn waved her hand dismissively. "I don't want to think about these things right now!"

"Do you want to go shopping? Dress up nicely, and who knows, you might have a chance encounter," Christina said with a playful wink.

It was unexpected that Christina had become the lively one between the two of them.

Kaitlyn shook her head. "The city's hustle and bustle means nothing to me now. I don't want to go shopping. It's pointless to dress up nicely if there's no one to appreciate it."

It was rare to see her so downcast.

Christina decided she had to cheer her up. "Where do you want to go? I'll go with you!"

"If we're going somewhere, let's go to a less crowded place with beautiful scenery. That would be interesting." Kaitlyn propped her chin on her hand, thinking. "Moonlit Ridge. I saw a travel ad for it. There are a lot of undeveloped areas that look really interesting."

"If you want to go, I'll go with you," Christina said firmly.

She had some free time recently and could afford to take a few days off for a trip.

Kaitlyn's eyes lit up. "I knew you were the best! Let's pack our things and go. I've always wanted to take a trip like this."

"That place isn't very close. Should we let Mr. Fisher know? So he doesn't worry about us," Christina suggested, feeling it was a bit irresponsible not to inform anyone.

"No need. What's the point of telling him? When you're young, you should just go when you feel like it," Kaitlyn said, suddenly energized as she started packing.

When she came out of her room, she peeked out with a mischievous smile. "You don't need to pack. You can wear my clothes, and we can buy anything we need on the way."

"Isn't this a bit too hasty?" Christina tried to persuade her, thinking it was best to inform their families to avoid any accidents.

But Kaitlyn was determined. "There's nothing to discuss. I've made up my mind. Are you coming with me or not? If not, I'll go alone."

Christina had no choice but to nod. "Alright then."

That day, Kaitlyn managed to book urgent plane tickets, and about twenty minutes later, they were at the airport.

Seeing Kaitlyn finally looking lively again, Christina breathed a sigh of relief. It was better for her to be adventurous than to stay home and brood.

Moonlit Ridge had a tourist area, but most of it was undeveloped wilderness.

As soon as they got off the bus, some locals were nearby selling goods.

"Come, come, all local specialties, guaranteed genuine!"

Kaitlyn picked up a fruit. "Can I try it?"

After getting the nod from the local, she took a small bite and shook her head. "Too sour. I don't want it. Let's go. I found a travel guide online. There's a route with very few people but beautiful scenery."

"Is it reliable?" Christina didn't want to dampen her spirits but felt a bit uneasy.

"Of course, it's reliable. Don't worry." Kaitlyn showed her some photos on her phone. "Look, isn't it beautiful? All taken on that route."

Christina couldn't refuse and agreed.

The initial part of the route was within the tourist area, but it became more desolate as they went further. The undeveloped areas were indeed stunning.

Kaitlyn walked along, taking pictures, not noticing how desolate it was becoming, with the signal getting weaker.

Christina grew worried and stopped. "We should head back."

Kaitlyn pouted. "I'm not done exploring yet."

Christina sighed. "Let's walk a few hundred more meters, then head back. Otherwise, we won't make it down the mountain before dark."

"Okay, okay." Kaitlyn agreed, but her expression showed she wasn't very serious.

They walked for a while longer, the forest growing denser, the scenery more untouched but increasingly desolate.

Christina started to feel scared. "How about we stay at the foot of the mountain?"

Kaitlyn turned back, unhappy. "Didn't you say you'd stick with me? Why are you always killing the mood?"

"This place is deserted and dangerous. If you really want to come, we can bring more people next time. Just the two of us is risky," Christina said, feeling the eerie atmosphere.

The more she thought about it, the more she felt something was off about the travel guide post. It seemed to lure women to this place. She didn't know if she was being overly sensitive or if there was a real reason to worry.

Kaitlyn finally seemed to listen and nodded. "Alright."

As they turned to head back, a few burly men appeared behind them. "Tourists, huh? College girls, and just the two of you?"

Kaitlyn hid behind Christina, terrified.

"What do you want?" Christina shielded her, eyeing the men warily. "What are you planning?"

"By the time you realized something was wrong, it was too late." The men advanced.

Christina pushed Kaitlyn. "Run!"

Kaitlyn took off.

Christina ran in the opposite direction.

But it wasn't long before they were both exhausted and caught on the mountain path.

"Did you really think you could outrun us?"

###chapter 99 What to Do Now

The two women were shoved into the car, their phones and IDs confiscated.

Kaitlyn clung to Christina, trembling. "Christina, what are we gonna do?"

Christina tried to stay calm. "It's okay, don't worry."

Outside, someone was making a phone call. "We just caught two new ones. They're both lookers. We're gonna make a fortune."

Kaitlyn's voice wavered with fear. "Are they gonna sell us off as brides? I don't want that!"

"Don't be scared!" Christina reassured her, though she was just as frightened. She knew she had to stay calm and think of a plan.

The man outside finished his call and grinned at them, revealing a mouthful of yellow teeth. "Sit tight, ladies. We're heading out!"

The car started moving, bumping along the road. They had no idea where they were being taken.

It had been two days, and Kelvin still hadn't heard from Kaitlyn. He was frantic, unable to reach her by phone.

Jennifer, accompanied by Arnold, was trying to be helpful. The housekeeper was recounting the events of the day.

"Miss Kaitlyn said she was going on a trip with Ms. Windsor. After that, we lost track of them."

Christina? Jennifer raised an eyebrow. "Kelvin, if Christina's involved, we should call the police."

Kelvin turned to her. "What do you mean?"

Jennifer looked earnest. "Christina will do anything for money and her own goals."

Kelvin was skeptical. "Really?"

Christina didn't seem like that kind of person. He had already misjudged her once and didn't want to repeat that mistake.

Jennifer's eyes narrowed with malice. "If she were trustworthy, why wouldn't she inform you before taking Miss Fisher away? Clearly, she's up to something!"

The housekeeper, fearing blame, chimed in. "Yes, they left in a hurry. Ms. Windsor must have said something."

Even if Kelvin wanted to trust Christina, their words were persuasive.

Jennifer delivered the final blow. "We need to investigate Christina. If something happens to Miss Fisher, it'll be too late."

Kelvin nodded, finally deciding to call the police.

The police arrived and took statements. With Jennifer's accusations, Kelvin's doubts, and the housekeeper's testimony, they listed Christina as a suspect.

"Can we issue an online alert if there's no news?" Jennifer asked, her eyes gleaming.

No matter the truth, she wanted to ruin Christina's reputation.

The police considered Kelvin's influence and the potential media frenzy, then nodded. "Of course. We'll issue an alert and do everything we can to find Miss Fisher. Please be patient."

Almost all available officers were dispatched to find Kaitlyn.

Meanwhile, Christina and Kaitlyn had no idea where they were being taken. They ended up in a remote village in the mountains.

They were locked in a straw-filled room, the wooden door secured from the outside.

Kaitlyn, on the verge of tears, said, "It's all my fault. I shouldn't have insisted on going to that dangerous place. What do we do now?"

"Don't panic!" Christina said, looking around.

The house was dilapidated but sturdy. Escaping would be difficult but not impossible.

As she considered a risky plan, the door suddenly opened.

Their captors brought in a new face.

"I told you they were pretty."

The newcomer, a local villager, looked delighted to see them.

"Not bad!"

"Which one do you want? I'll give you a good price, eighty thousand dollars." The seller gestured the amount.

"That's too expensive," the buyer protested. "For that money, I could marry a proper wife."

"A proper wife wouldn't be as obedient as one you buy. She'll give you a handsome son with her genes."

The trafficker was like a salesman.

The buyer hesitated, then agreed. "She's beautiful. It's worth it. Eighty thousand dollars. I'll invite you to the wedding."

"Deal! Cash first, then the goods." The seller rubbed his hands eagerly.

"Come to my place for the money. I'll take this one." The buyer pointed at Kaitlyn.

Kaitlyn recoiled in fear. "No, I don't want to go! Let me go! Do you know who I am?"

The buyer's eyes gleamed with greed. "I don't care who you are. You're my wife now."

Kaitlyn was on the verge of tears, crying out, "No, no! Let me go!"

Christina held her hand. "She's my sister. Can we have one last day together? I'll be grateful."

The buyer, unable to resist, agreed. "Fine, but remember my kindness. Stay with me obediently."

Kaitlyn cried harder.

Living with this man for life was worse than death. She'd rather die now.

"Let's get the money," the buyer said, grinning. "I'll take her tomorrow. I need to prepare and buy new clothes."

They left.

Kaitlyn sobbed. "What do we do now?"

Christina's eyes narrowed. The room had straw, rope, and some firewood. There was a window with a thick wooden frame.

"We have to try something extreme."

Christina made a simple fire-starting tool, rubbing the rope against the wood.

Kaitlyn understood. "Let me."

Desperate, she worked the rope vigorously.

After a long effort, they finally got a spark. It landed on the straw, but the fire was small and might not catch.

###chapter 100  How to Escape Again?

The two of them huddled together, like they were nurturing a fragile flame of hope, carefully tending to it until it finally grew stronger.

"What do we do now?" Kaitlyn turned her head and asked.

"First, we burn the window frame, then we'll make a run for it," Christina said, her plan already formed, exuding calm confidence.

Kaitlyn nodded, picked up a piece of firewood, lit it, and placed it under the window frame, adding more wood piece by piece.

Christina made sure the fire didn't spread too much, holding a burning stick as she walked to the door.

Kaitlyn, anxious, kept checking to see if the fire was catching.

Through the crack in the door, Christina suddenly saw the trafficker who had captured them, chatting with someone as he walked down the dirt road towards them.

"Hurry, we don't have much time," she urged.

"The fire isn't big enough yet," Kaitlyn added more wood.

Seeing the fire blazing, Christina lit the straw piled by the door and shouted, "Fire! Help!"

The trafficker, seeing the thick smoke, panicked and ran over.

"Help! Water! Where's the water?"

Christina also shouted for help a few times, then quickly ran to the window. The two of them started smashing the window together.

The trafficker was frantic. If they got rescued but ended up disfigured, they wouldn't fetch a good price.

He hurried to find help to put out the fire.

Christina, while smashing the window, weakly called for help a couple more times.

They inhaled a lot of smoke, but driven by the will to survive, they finally broke the window open.

Christina helped Kaitlyn climb out first.

"Go! Run!"

Kaitlyn stumbled out, running clumsily.

Christina followed, ignoring the burning hot window frame, driven by her desire to live.

Behind them was a small mountain path, and they dashed into it, running for their lives.

The house behind them was engulfed in flames.

Villagers were bustling around.

"Rescue them! Quick, put out the fire!"

Christina glanced back. If those people thought they had perished in the fire, that would be perfect-no one would chase them. But if they did come after them, how would they escape these endless mountains?

They didn't know how long they had been running.

Kaitlyn, exhausted and thirsty, collapsed to the ground. "I can't run anymore."

Christina stopped too. "We can't keep running aimlessly."

"We don't know this place. Where should we go?" Kaitlyn asked in despair.

The dense forest made her want to cry. If they couldn't find their way back, they might die in these desolate mountains.

Christina looked up. "The car was in the mountains. We headed west when we came in, so if we go east, we might find our way back."

Kaitlyn asked, "How do we know which way is east?"

Christina replied, "The sun is setting. We go in the opposite direction of the sunset."

It was their only option.

Kaitlyn nodded. In the face of survival, everything else seemed insignificant.

They didn't know how long they had been walking, hungry and tired.

As night fell, the cold in the forest became biting. Christina and Kaitlyn supported each other, using their last bit of strength to keep searching for a way out. The last light of the day disappeared, leaving only the sounds of insects and the wind in the trees.

"What if we can't find our way out?" Kaitlyn's voice was on the verge of tears, her spirit nearly broken.

Christina took a deep breath, trying to stay calm. "We will. We just have to keep going. We'll find our way home."

Just then, they heard a faint sound in the distance, clear in the quiet night. They exchanged hopeful glances.

"Someone's coming," Christina whispered.

They quickly hid in the bushes, holding their breath as they watched. Two figures with flashlights walked slowly along the path, dressed like local villagers.

Kaitlyn suggested, "Maybe we should ask them for help. If they have food, that would be even better."

Christina shook her head. "No."

"Why not? We'll get lost if we keep wandering," Kaitlyn asked, confused.

Christina explained, "The villagers here all know each other. If they see us, they'll know what happened. If they take us back, all our efforts will be wasted."

She had seen many stories like this on the news-rescued girls often faced the biggest obstacles from local villagers.

Each household knew each other well, forming alliances to prevent women from escaping.

Kaitlyn bit her lip and nodded.

They waited in the bushes until the villagers passed, then continued in the direction they had been heading.

Exhausted, Christina found some wild fruits. "These are safe to eat. Let's regain some strength."

Kaitlyn nodded, tears almost uncontrollable, and hugged her.

"If I had been alone, I would have been forced to have children. I'm so glad you're here to help me escape."

"Now's not the time for that, or for crying," Christina comforted her. They ate the fruits and kept moving.

The endless mountains were a huge barrier. After a whole day and night, they finally found a road by the next evening.

Christina observed for a while. With no cars in sight, they walked along the road.

Hearing a car, Kaitlyn's first instinct was to hide.

Christina watched from the side, seeing it was an out-of-state car, a nice model, not something a local would drive.

She ran out, waving her arms. "Stop! Stop!"

The car screeched to a halt, and a young man in travel gear got out.

"What you did was dangerous, you know?"

"We're in danger. Can you take us to the city? We need to call the police," Christina pleaded.

The man looked her over, seeing she wasn't lying, and nodded. "Okay, I'll take you to the police."

###chapter 101 It Is Indeed Her

After a few days, they finally got to enjoy a hot cup of coffee at the local police station.

Since a missing person alert had already been issued, Kelvin was notified immediately to come and pick them up.

When Kelvin arrived, the situation had already blown up, and they had to give the public an explanation, so he brought along a lot of reporters.

Kaitlyn, feeling like she had narrowly escaped a disaster, threw herself into Kelvin's arms. "Grandpa, I promise I won't be reckless anymore. It's all my fault for insisting on going on that trip and getting kidnapped."

Kelvin asked urgently, "Who were the kidnappers?"

Kaitlyn wiped away her tears. "I don't know where we escaped from. We wandered in the mountains for a whole day and night before a kind person helped us out. If Christina hadn't been with me, I might never have seen you again, Grandpa."

She burst into tears, finally releasing all the pent-up frustration and fear from the past few days.

Christina watched them with envy.

At least Kaitlyn had someone to lean on, while she had no one.

But fortunately, the misunderstanding about Christina being a suspect had been cleared up. Now, she was being praised online for her bravery in leading her friend out of the mountains.

Kelvin was furious and kept asking Kaitlyn for details, vowing to find the village and bring the kidnappers to justice.

However, the mountainous area was vast and uncharted, and finding the place or the people involved was uncertain. They could only cooperate with the local police and do their best.

Christina returned to school.

With finals approaching, she needed to study and prepare for her last exam.

While waiting for her results, rumors started spreading around the school.

People were saying that Christina had seduced the dean to get good grades and graduate smoothly.

Christina was speechless when she heard these rumors.

Suddenly, a student came to her. "Someone wants to see you in the principal's office."

Christina walked over, surprised to see the dean there. The moment he saw her, he frowned.

"She did try to seduce me to pass her finals, but I'm a man of integrity. How could I agree to that? I sternly warned her not to have such thoughts."

Christina couldn't believe he was saying this, clearly trying to frame her.

She smiled faintly. "Principal, I can't believe what I'm hearing. Does he have any evidence?"

"People saw it. Don't deny it. With all these rumors, I can't protect you anymore," the dean said coldly, frowning.

Christina found it laughable. "Where did these rumors come from? Could it be from you? Look at yourself-bald, overweight. Do you really think I'd seduce you?"

Since he was already slandering her, she didn't hold back.

The dean was furious, his face turning red. "You!"

Christina pressed on. "Alright, tell me exactly where I supposedly seduced you. What did you do? How did you 'educate' me? Explain it all!"

The dean snorted. "Fine, if you want to be shameless, I won't hold back."

He then described an exaggerated and false scenario.

"Who saw it? Who spread it? There must be a witness," Christina sneered. "Right now, it's just your word against mine. Who can be trusted?"

The dean was prepared. "Principal, let him in. He didn't mean to spread it; he just didn't know what to do. Don't blame him."

The principal nodded. "At this point, what else can we do? Let him in."

A boy with glasses walked in, adjusting his frames.

He briefly described what he supposedly saw.

Christina caught a flaw. "You said I threw myself at the seated dean, begging him to help me pass. You saw this from outside the door, but the dean was facing the door. How did you see my face?"

The boy panicked. "The dean yelled at you, and I saw your face when you turned to leave."

Christina laughed. "Your story doesn't add up. You said the dean got up and yelled at me while I was on the ground. How did you see my face with the desk in the way?"

The boy became more flustered under her questioning.

Christina pressed on. "Tell me, what did you get for framing me?"

The boy's face turned red. "I didn't. You're lying."

The dean couldn't stand it anymore. "Don't intimidate him."

Christina sneered at the dean. "I'm just pointing out the inconsistencies. How is that intimidation? Am I wrong to defend myself?"

"If I remember correctly, the grades should be out by now," Christina continued.

The principal nodded. "I'll make a call."

"Ask about my ranking. I may not be first, but I should be in the top ten. With that confidence, why would I need to cheat?"

Christina lifted her chin confidently.

The principal made a call, and after checking Christina's grades, he narrowed his eyes.

"I knew it. You're an excellent student. How could you do such a thing? You got first place this time. Congratulations."

Christina turned to the dean with a cold smile. "If you change your story now, saying I got first place because of you, maybe you can still frame me."

The dean's face grew darker.

Would changing his story help now?

The principal stood up. "You don't need to come in tomorrow. As a teacher, you have no integrity. I'm afraid you'll corrupt the students."

The dean chased after him. "Let me explain, Principal. I was forced!"

Christina looked at the boy. "You lied. If you don't want to be expelled, you'd better tell me who put you up to this."

The boy, terrified, stammered, "It was Jennifer."

Of course, it was her!

Jennifer had tampered with the online reports before Christina returned, and now this!

Jennifer was truly a persistent and disgusting pest!

###chapter 102 Hacker Z

As Christina was lost in thought, the boy suddenly dropped to his knees with a thud, crying out, "Please don't tell him. I had no choice. My family's broke, and I need the money."

Even though Christina didn't know him well, she noticed his worn-out shoes and realized he was telling the truth.

Still, she responded coldly, "I'll let it slide this time. But if you pull something like this again, don't expect me to be so forgiving."

The boy, tears streaming down his face, nodded repeatedly. "I promise!"

Christina took a deep breath and walked away.

With William protecting Jennifer, even if Christina exposed this incident, it might not lead to any consequences for her.

Better to let it go.

Meanwhile, at the company, William was overwhelmed by the myriad of issues piling up.

Bob rushed in. "Mr. Cavendish, they said they can't help. Their tech isn't advanced enough, and these hackers might be foreign operatives trying to steal our latest technology."

The firewall was up, but William had no idea how much it could withstand.

"So, what do we do now?" William paced back and forth.

Bob's eyes suddenly lit up. "I've heard there's a group of hackers who help companies fend off attacks. They're incredibly skilled!"

"Look into it," William said calmly. "Hire them at any cost."

"Got it." Bob made several calls and then reported back, "I found out the most renowned hacker in the circle goes by the codename Z."

"Contact them. Whatever it takes, get them on board," William instructed.

"Understood." After several attempts, Bob finally got Z's contact information.

When he called, the voice on the other end was androgynous, with a slight electronic distortion-typical of a hacker masking their identity.

"Hello, I was referred to you. Our company's firewall is under attack, and we need your expertise to strengthen it," Bob explained.

"For a firewall, any decent hacker should suffice. My rates are very high," Z's voice was flat, almost robotic.

"Our company is very important. These technical documents are crucial to national security, so we need someone highly reliable," Bob said earnestly.

Z hesitated for a moment. "Alright, if you can afford my rates, I'll do it."

Bob sighed in relief. "Don't worry, the Cavendish Corporation can pay whatever you ask."

"The Cavendish Corporation?" Z suddenly asked.

Bob chuckled. "Yes, if you can fend off this attack, your reputation will skyrocket in the hacker community."

"Sorry, but I don't need the fame. I just remembered I have other commitments. You'll have to find someone else," Z said coldly.

Bob was baffled. What had gone wrong? Why had Z's attitude changed so abruptly?

He quickly said, "Please don't hang up. We'll pay whatever you ask. Just name your price, and we'll meet it."

Z didn't hang up but laughed softly. "Sorry, no amount of money will make me take this job. You'd better find someone else."

With that, Z hung up swiftly.

Bob was frustrated. Who turns down a lucrative offer like that? The Cavendish Corporation could pay a hefty sum.

When he tried calling back, he was shocked to find the number was now disconnected.

William frowned at him. "You couldn't secure the deal?"

"Yeah, it's strange. We offered a blank check, but they refused without even discussing the price," Bob shook his head.

William frowned deeper. "Is there any other way to contact them?"

"The number's now disconnected. It was probably a VoIP call," Bob said seriously. "If a hacker doesn't want to be found, it's nearly impossible to reach them."

They had no choice but to consider other options.

Bob muttered to himself, "Is the Cavendish Corporation really that bad? Why did they refuse as soon as they heard our name?"

William didn't catch that. "What did you say?"

Bob quickly replied, "Nothing!"

William didn't press further.

After delivering the architectural plans, Christina was about to hail a cab back to the office when she noticed a luxury car parked by the curb. An elegant elderly lady stepped out.

"Could you help me carry these things upstairs?"

The lady was dressed in a chic Chanel dress, with a matching hat. Despite her age, she exuded grace and sophistication.

Christina couldn't help but admire her, hoping she could be as elegant when she grew old.

Just then, a screeching sound of tires came from the street. Christina looked up to see several cars colliding, one of which lost control and sped towards them.

If it didn't stop, it would crash into the lady's car, and she would be in grave danger!

Without thinking, Christina rushed over and pulled the lady away.

In the nick of time, the car crashed into the lady's vehicle, knocking the driver unconscious and slamming the car into a wall.

The car finally came to a halt.

The elderly lady, still shaken, grasped Christina's hand. "Thank you, dear. If it weren't for you, I might have been seriously hurt."

"It's nothing, really. Are you okay?" Christina asked, relieved.

The lady shook her head. "I'm fine."

Christina nodded. "If you're alright, I'll be on my way."

"Wait, don't go yet," the lady held onto her. "I'll call my family to come over."

Considering the lady was alone with just her driver, Christina felt uneasy leaving her. She nodded. "Alright, call your family. I'll wait with you."

The lady, seemingly afraid Christina might leave, kept holding her hand as she made a call.

"Grandson, come quickly. I've been in an accident."

The voice on the other end was anxious. "Where are you, Grandma?"

The lady looked around for a landmark.

Christina helpfully said, "Harmony Center."

"Yes, that's right," the lady echoed.

"Okay, I'm on my way," the voice said before hanging up.

###chapter 103  How Is She So Lucky

Christina waited with the elderly lady for a bit, and soon enough, a sleek, custom-made car pulled up at the door.

The car door swung open, revealing a pair of striking long legs. A man in a white suit, standing tall at nearly six foot three, stepped out. His presence was commanding.

His eyes were deep and mysterious, like stars in the night sky, exuding an indescribable charm. His jawline was perfectly chiseled, making it hard to look away from his handsome face.

"Grandma, you okay?" he asked, his expression full of concern as he helped the elderly lady.

"I'm fine!" The elderly lady patted his hand and smiled warmly. "Thanks to this young lady who saved my life, otherwise, it would've been a mess."

The man nodded at Christina. "Hey, I'm Kingsley Rockefeller."

"Hi, I'm Christina Windsor," she replied, extending her hand.

After shaking hands, Christina smiled at the elderly lady. "Since your family's here, I can head out now."

The elderly lady immediately held her hand. "You saved my life; I have to repay you. If you don't mind, let Kingsley give you a ride home."

The elderly lady's gaze suddenly became serious as she carefully examined Christina, as if searching for something on her face.

Christina felt a bit embarrassed. "It was nothing, really. You don't need to worry about it."

"If I don't repay you, I won't be able to sleep tonight. Would you really let an old lady like me stay up all night?" The elderly lady's eyes were intense.

Christina had no choice but to agree. "Alright."

She and the elderly lady got into Kingsley's car.

The accident at the scene was handled by the driver.

In the car, the elderly lady asked about her situation. "Do you have any family?"

Although Christina found the question a bit abrupt, she figured they were too wealthy to deceive someone like her, so she answered truthfully.

"I only have my mom."

"How old are you?" the elderly lady continued.

Christina smiled. "I'm twenty-two. Just graduated from college."

"What did you study?" The elderly lady seemed determined to know everything.

"Architecture," Christina replied honestly.

"Architecture is a good field, tough to get into. You must be smart, just like..." The elderly lady trailed off, her face full of melancholy, as if recalling something from the past.

Seeing her lost in thought, Christina asked, "What are you thinking about?"

The elderly lady shook her head and smiled. "Nothing."

Although Christina found it odd, she didn't say anything.

After a while, they arrived at their destination.

The elderly lady looked at the apartment building. "You live here?"

"Yeah, it's nice and close to my job. I work at the architecture firm nearby," Christina said with a smile.

"Really?" The elderly lady seemed thoughtful. "I remember Kelvin's architecture firm is nearby. Are you working there?"

"You know Kelvin? Yeah, he's my boss, Mr. Fisher," Christina said, surprised by the connection.

The elderly lady nodded knowingly. "Good, I know where to find you. I won't keep you if you have things to do."

Christina nodded slightly and quickly left.

Kingsley, who had been standing by, opened the car door for the elderly lady. "Grandma."

"Do you think she looks like her?" the elderly lady asked.

Kingsley's eyes showed a hint of helplessness. "She does, but that doesn't mean she is."

The elderly lady had been disappointed many times before and didn't want to be disappointed again.

She got into the car. "Regardless, she saved me. Since she works in architecture, and we have business in that field, you should get to know her better."

"Yes, Grandma," Kingsley said with a smile as he got into the car.

The next day at the architecture firm, the assistant excitedly announced the arrival of an important guest.

Bruce, hearing about the guest, was eager to greet them.

The assistant, however, looked at Christina. "They're here to see you. You've really brought in a lot of projects for our firm."

"Me?" Christina raised an eyebrow in surprise.

She didn't recall any recent deals.

But since they were looking for her, she had no reason not to meet them. She headed to the meeting room, with Bruce fuming behind her.

"I don't know how she gets so lucky."

As Christina entered the meeting room, she saw a man sitting on the sofa, holding a book. His every move exuded an air of nobility.

"Hello, are you looking for me?" Christina asked.

The man put down the book, revealing Kingsley's distinguished face.

Seeing him, Christina was surprised. "It's you?"

Kingsley smiled. "Surprised?"

"Not really. Why are you here?" Christina asked, pouring him a cup of coffee and sitting across from him.

"Didn't the assistant tell you? I'm here to discuss a project with you, an architectural design," Kingsley said with a smile.

Christina hesitated.

She should be happy about a project coming to her.

"What's the matter? Ms. Windsor, are you too busy?" Kingsley raised an eyebrow.

Christina quickly shook her head. "No."

"Then please, share your concerns," Kingsley said patiently.

Christina cleared her throat. "I didn't save your grandmother expecting anything in return. It was just something anyone would do."

Kingsley laughed, his eyes full of warmth.

"I know you had no ulterior motives, but the Rockefeller family always repays kindness. Besides, I reviewed your work before coming here. It's impressive and fits our needs."

Christina took a deep breath.

Kingsley continued, "Moreover, this is just an initial invitation. Whether your designs are accepted by the entire project team depends on your own efforts."

With his words, Christina felt she had no reason to refuse. She nodded slightly. "Alright then."

Kingsley smiled. "This project is for an international art museum. It might take some time."

"No problem, I have plenty of time," Christina said, taking a deep breath.

No matter what, the opportunity was in front of her. Seizing it was her true skill.

Kingsley checked the time. "There's a banquet tomorrow night at seven. You'll need to accompany me."

###chapter 104  Is It Related to This Project

"Is this about the project?" Christina asked.

"Yeah, it is," Kingsley replied, giving her a quick once-over. "There are gonna be a lot of important people there. You need a proper gown."

Christina got the message. If she was going to be with Kingsley, she couldn't risk being underdressed and embarrassing him.

"Alright, I'll get a gown ready."

Kingsley shook his head. "No time for a custom-made dress now. I'll take you to pick one out."

"What?" Christina was surprised.

"I'll feel better that way," Kingsley said, glancing at his watch. "It's still early. Let's go today."

Christina wasn't used to such a fast pace, but since he had already decided, she had no choice but to agree. She told her assistant she was stepping out and followed Kingsley downstairs.

They arrived at an upscale mall, filled with high-end designer stores. Kingsley didn't even glance at the dresses on the racks. He went straight to a store clerk and said, "Bring out your best pieces."

Kingsley's aura of wealth was unmistakable. The clerk, sensing a big sale, immediately invited them inside.

The interior was even more luxurious, with a spacious layout showcasing only a few exclusive gowns, clearly limited editions.

Kingsley selected a few dresses and handed them to Christina. "Try these on."

Christina nodded. After trying on the first dress, she came out, and Kingsley gave a slight nod. "Next one."

It seemed he wasn't satisfied. Christina went back to try another dress.

She thought all the dresses were beautiful, especially the last one, which was made of silk and flowed like water.

Kingsley gave another slight nod and even took out his phone to snap a few photos.

"What's wrong? Doesn't it look good?" Christina asked, puzzled.

Kingsley shook his head. "It's not that. Keep trying."

Christina had no choice. After trying on seven or eight dresses, her arms were starting to ache.

Kingsley seemed to notice her fatigue and smiled faintly at the clerk. "Wrap up all of them except the gray one; it's too dull."

Christina was stunned. "You're buying all of them? That's too much."

"There will be many more occasions like this. It's good to be prepared," Kingsley said matter-of-factly.

"But we don't need so many," Christina tried to reason.

But the clerk was already leading Kingsley to the register.

He pulled out a black card with gold edges, essentially an unlimited credit card.

Christina couldn't stop him. The dresses were already bought. Kingsley selected one. "Wear this one tomorrow. Have the others sent to her apartment and this one to Elysian Designs."

"Sure," the clerk said, jotting down the details with a wide smile.

As they left, they passed a jewelry store. Kingsley led her inside.

"Your skin is so fair; vibrant gemstones will look great on you. Let's go with these."

He had the clerk bring out several pieces. After Christina tried them on, he was satisfied and paid for them.

Christina sighed. "I don't even know if the deal will go through. Isn't it a waste to give me so much?"

"How can gifts for a beautiful woman be a waste? Besides, you saved my grandmother. It's only right for my family to treat you well," Kingsley said with a smile.

Christina felt even more embarrassed. "I've told you, it was just a small favor. If you keep treating it like a big deal, I'll feel burdened."

Kingsley laughed. "Alright, alright. It's just for the event tomorrow. You need to look the part. Don't worry about it, okay?"

Christina knew that for the wealthy, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars was like pocket change. Her protests would only make her seem annoying. She decided to borrow the jewelry for the event and return it afterward.

The next day, Kingsley's car took her directly to Elysian Designs.

With the gown and the styling, she looked like a different person in the mirror.

The designer looked at her with satisfaction. "Ms. Windsor, you look stunning. This gown suits you perfectly, and the jewelry complements your elegance."

Christina turned around and saw Kingsley standing behind her, smiling. "I knew I had good taste."

Christina smiled back. "May I ask what Mr. Kingsley Rockefeller does for a living?"

Kingsley shrugged. "I run the family business."

Christina joked, "With such good taste, I thought you might be in the fashion industry."

Kingsley laughed. "If I didn't have the family business, I might have gone into design. We could have been colleagues."

The event was at an exclusive private venue, the kind that ordinary people never get to see. Luxury cars lined the entrance, a symbol of opulence.

As soon as they entered, they drew everyone's attention.

"Who's that?" someone asked.

"Don't you know Mr. Kingsley Rockefeller from the Rockefeller Family?" a companion replied, swirling his drink. "Kingsley may not be a biological son, but with no other heirs, he's set to inherit the entire family fortune."

"I know him, but who's the woman?"

Christina felt countless eyes on her, all curious about her identity.

The atmosphere was lively, with elites mingling and showcasing their status through their conversations and mannerisms.

Though Christina wasn't used to such events, she tried to stay calm, smiling as she and Kingsley greeted people.

"Mr. Zane Johnson, long time no see," Kingsley greeted a middle-aged man.

Zane turned and smiled. "Mr. Kingsley Rockefeller, you usually come alone. Who's your companion?"

"This is the designer for our project," Kingsley introduced.

"So young," Zane said, patting Kingsley's shoulder. "You didn't just find someone to boost her profile and put her on my project, did you?"

"No," Kingsley replied, frowning slightly. "I don't have the power to just place anyone on the project. My grandmother approved her."

###chapter 105 I Support You

"I can't believe you got the old lady's approval," Zane said, looking at Christina with newfound respect. His usual laid-back attitude had shifted to one of admiration. "She must've seen something special in you, especially at your age."

"Of course," Kingsley added with a grin. "Christina led the design for the transoceanic bridge project. Despite her age, she's got an impressive resume."

Christina was surprised that Kingsley had done such thorough research on her. It must have been part of his due diligence before partnering with her-trust but verify, as they say.

Zane raised his glass. "I have a lot of respect for Ms. Windsor, but the project team will be the real challenge. Let's have a drink and hope our collaboration goes smoothly."

Christina immediately lifted her glass. "I should be the one to toast you."

"It's all the same," Zane said with a warm smile, raising his glass.

Christina smiled politely, clinked glasses with Zane, and downed her drink in one go.

Just as she set her glass down, a commotion erupted nearby. "Mr. Cavendish, your presence truly graces our humble abode."

Turning around, Christina saw William, naturally accompanied by Jennifer. She hadn't expected to run into them here-what rotten luck.

Kingsley put down his glass. "I need to introduce you to the rest of the project team. You've made a great impression today; they'll come to respect you soon enough."

Christina nodded with a smile. "Alright."

They headed upstairs; the venue was expansive, with private lounges on the upper floors.

William suddenly felt a strange gaze on him and looked in that direction. The figure in red seemed oddly familiar.

Jennifer, noticing his distraction, asked with a smile, "Mr. Cavendish, what are you looking at?"

William snapped back to reality. "Nothing."

But his eyes involuntarily drifted back to the red figure, a peculiar feeling rising within him.

Jennifer, sensing his unease, followed his gaze and smiled slightly. "That lady has quite the presence. Do you find her familiar too?"

William frowned slightly. He wouldn't show any interest in Christina in front of Jennifer. "Maybe it's just my imagination."

They continued mingling at the party, while Christina and Kingsley engaged in initial discussions with the project team in an elegantly decorated private lounge.

"If the old lady approves, what more can we say? But this project is tied to our international image, so..." The team members swirled their drinks thoughtfully.

Christina nodded. "I understand. I know my place."

"Since the Rockefeller Family recommended you, we can't really object," one man said with a smile, though Christina sensed some reluctance. The Rockefeller Family had a major stake in the project, and unless they withdrew, there was little chance of changing the personnel.

After a moment of thought, Christina spoke up. "How about this: we don't rush to sign the contract. Let's start with the design. Once you're satisfied with the work, we can finalize the agreement."

The team exchanged glances, finally looking to Kingsley.

Kingsley frowned. With the Rockefeller Family's backing, Christina didn't need to take such risks. A few standout projects would quickly establish her reputation in the architectural world.

Understanding Kingsley's concern, Christina said, "Mr. Kingsley Rockefeller, I know you trust me, but this is my first major project. If I don't prove myself, I won't feel confident moving forward."

"If that's how you feel, I support you," Kingsley nodded. He had come to see Christina as someone with strong self-respect. If she wanted the team's full approval, he would respect that.

If she couldn't win them over, he had other projects for her.

Midway through the event, Kingsley received a call and excused himself. "I have something to handle. I'll be back soon. Make yourself comfortable."

He stepped out onto the terrace, where the call was from the old lady.

"How's it going? Has she been accepted?" she asked with a smile.

"These people are tough. It's not that easy," Kingsley sighed. "I could force it, but..."

"But what?" she pressed.

Kingsley recounted the recent events.

The old lady found it amusing. "Doesn't she remind you of me?"

"Of course, anyone you approve of would," Kingsley laughed.

"Don't forget what I asked you to do," she said, her tone suddenly serious.

"Don't worry, I won't," Kingsley assured her.

Back in the lounge, after a few more exchanges, the team members gradually left, leaving Christina alone.

Feeling a bit bored, she decided to take a walk. As she reached the staircase, she ran into William and Jennifer.

"What a coincidence," William said with a hint of mockery.

Christina smiled calmly and greeted them. "Uncle, Ms. Spencer, I didn't expect to see you here."

Jennifer looked Christina up and down, a complex emotion in her eyes. "Ms. Windsor, you look stunning tonight. But with your status, you wouldn't normally get into an event like this. How did you manage it?"

Christina smiled slightly, not intending to explain much. "I was lucky to have a friend's invitation."

Jennifer scoffed. "Are you scheming for another 'chance encounter'?"

"Chance encounter? In a place like this? Not everyone revolves their life around men like you do," Christina retorted coolly.

William's expression darkened, clearly displeased with her response.

Christina, feeling she had been polite enough, turned to leave.

But William suddenly blocked her path. "Christina, who have you latched onto now?"

Jennifer sneered. "Christina, using your body might get you temporary wealth, but you should think about the long term."

###chapter 106 Don't Worry About It

Christina found it laughable and shot him a dismissive glance. "How I handle things is none of your business."

With that, she turned and walked away, her red dress flowing like a vibrant cloud.

William narrowed his cold eyes, watching her retreating figure.

As Christina descended the stairs, Kingsley approached her.

"Why'd you come down?"

"Everyone's left, so I thought I'd come down too," Christina replied with a smile.

"Good. Wanna dance?" Kingsley extended his hand and cleared his throat. "May I have the honor of a dance with this beautiful lady?"

"But I..." Christina hesitated, wanting to refuse.

"Come on!" Kingsley didn't give her a chance to decline. He took her hand and spun her into the center of the dance floor.

In their white and red attire, they danced gracefully together, capturing the attention of all the guests.

The five-minute dance was exhilarating, providing a visual feast for everyone watching.

As the dance ended, Kingsley whispered in her ear with a chuckle, "You dance wonderfully. You're the best partner I've ever had."

Christina blushed and smiled. "Thanks!"

When she turned around, she suddenly noticed William staring at her intently, his gaze filled with complex emotions.

A shiver ran down her spine, and she quickly looked away.

The banquet soon concluded. After exchanging farewells with others, Christina and Kingsley headed outside. Kingsley told her, "Wait here. I'll get the car."

"Okay," Christina nodded.

She stood on the wide street, glancing around. Apart from the luxury cars of the guests, there were no other vehicles.

Unexpectedly, a car pulled up in front of her, and the window rolled down to reveal William.

"Get in."

Christina frowned. "I have someone to take me home. No need to trouble you, Uncle."

"Don't make me repeat myself," William's tone carried a hint of threat.

Christina bit her lip. "Sorry, but my work isn't finished yet. I can't go with you."

With so many security guards around, she figured William wouldn't want to cause a scene.

William didn't expect her to be so bold. He got out of the car, his tall frame imposing as he stood before her.

"Christina, have you fallen so low?"

"Low? What do you mean?" Christina couldn't help but laugh. "Even if he were just a colleague, so what if there's something between us?"

At that moment, another car pulled up behind them.

Sensing the tension, Kingsley got out and positioned himself protectively in front of Christina. "What's going on?"

William's gaze was intense, like a brewing storm.

"I'm her uncle. Is there a problem with me taking her home?"

"That depends on her wishes," Kingsley replied, looking at Christina.

Christina took a deep breath and stepped back. "Mr. Kingsley Rockefeller, I'd appreciate it if you could take me home."

"Of course," Kingsley nodded and escorted her to his car.

William watched them with narrowed eyes, saying nothing.

As the car cruised down the road, Christina finally started to relax a bit.

Kingsley glanced over at her. "Is he your ex?"

"No," Christina shook her head.

"Then why's there such weird tension between you two?" Kingsley was perceptive and sensed something unspoken between them.

Christina took a deep breath, holding her head. "It's a long story. He's technically my uncle, but some misunderstandings have strained our relationship."

"You said you had no family besides your mom," Kingsley probed further.

"Yeah, only my mom is related to me by blood," Christina smiled wryly. "Let's not dwell on unpleasant things."

Kingsley didn't press further, staring ahead as if lost in thought.

William followed them in his car, watching as Kingsley dropped Christina off and drove away before he finally relaxed.

"Colleagues? Really?"

The next day, as Christina was busy working on her designs, her assistant called her. "You're really popular lately. What's your secret? Everyone's looking for you."

"Someone else wants to see me? It's not the same person from yesterday, is it?" Christina was puzzled.

"No," the assistant shook her head.

The more work, the better. Earning money meant independence, so Christina had no reason to refuse. She followed her assistant to the meeting room.

A well-dressed man with glasses greeted her. "Ms. Windsor, it's an honor to meet you. Your reputation precedes you."

"You're too kind," Christina said, offering him a seat and pouring him a glass of water.

"There's an urgent project in Starfall City, and we couldn't find anyone suitable. I thought of you, Ms. Windsor, given your award-winning work. Do you have any availability?" the man asked sincerely.

"I have some ongoing projects, but I can manage additional work," Christina replied honestly.

"That's great," the man sighed in relief, handing her a contract. "I've prepared the contract. If everything looks good, we can finalize it."

"Is it that urgent?" Christina found it odd.

"Yes, the project was supposed to start a month ago, but the designer had issues, causing delays. We can't afford any more delays, or we'll face penalties," the man explained, looking troubled. "We need to visit the site tomorrow. If you accept, we'll offer you the best rate."

Christina glanced at the contract.

Everything was clearly stated, with no hidden clauses or traps. The company's seal was already on it, and it seemed legitimate.

After some thought, she said, "Alright, but I need to run this by our legal team first."

"Of course," the man agreed readily. "If everything's in order, I'll book your flight for tomorrow."

Christina nodded. "Once our legal team approves, I'll sign."

After confirming there were no issues, and given the company's reputable standing in the industry, Christina felt reassured. She signed the contract and had the man book her flight.

The man looked relieved. "Thank you, Ms. Windsor. We'll arrange everything for your trip tomorrow."

###chapter 107 Are You Following Me?

The next day, Christina boarded the plane as planned.

To her surprise, her company had booked her a first-class ticket. She had stayed up all night and hadn't slept well, so this was a perfect opportunity to catch up on some rest.

But just as she settled into her seat, someone arrived beside her. She quickly placed her luggage in the overhead compartment and turned to see that it was William.

"Are you stalking me?" Christina blurted out instinctively.

William glanced at her indifferently. "I'm on a business trip."

Christina pressed her lips together and said nothing more.

The two-hour flight was pure torture for her. When they finally landed, she waited at the airport entrance for her ride.

Soon, a luxury car pulled up in front of them. "Mr. Cavendish, Ms. Windsor, please get in. The hotel is ready for you."

"You?" Christina pointed incredulously at William and asked the driver, "He's with me?"

The driver smiled and nodded. "Yes, didn't he tell you? Mr. Cavendish is the lead on this project and recommended you as the designer."

"No way, I'm going back!" Christina turned to leave.

William spoke calmly from the side, "Don't forget, you signed a contract. If you breach it, you'll have to pay a hefty penalty."

Christina bit her lip hard. "You set me up."

William scoffed, a hint of mockery in his voice. "Set you up? You're giving yourself too much credit."

"Then what do you mean?" Christina chased after him.

But William simply got into the car. "We're leaving in one minute. If she doesn't get in, just leave her."

The driver looked troubled, seeing the two of them about to argue.

Christina gritted her teeth. She had read the contract and knew that breaching it would indeed cost her a significant amount of money. At the time, she thought the high penalty was just a precaution from the other party, but now she realized it was a trap.

With no other choice, she got into the car.

The company had arranged for them to stay at a five-star hotel, in the presidential suite.

Once inside, Christina clenched her fists and told herself, "Fine, no matter what, I'll finish my work first. I'll deal with everything else later."

She really had no other options.

She took out her paper and drawing tools, planning to work on some designs.

But just as she started sketching, there was a knock on the door. She opened it with the security chain still on and saw that it was William.

"They've prepared a welcome banquet for us. As the designer, you have to attend."

"Tell them I'm not feeling well," Christina didn't want to go.

"You seem perfectly fine to me," William squinted at her. "I'm not lying for you. If you want to breach the contract, go ahead."

With that, he turned and left.

Christina had no choice but to quickly get ready and head downstairs.

The car was already waiting for her.

As the car drove away from the hotel, Christina sat with a sullen face, not saying a word. She couldn't understand why William was treating her this way.

The banquet was lavishly decorated, with all kinds of food and drinks. The guests were all prominent figures, chatting and laughing, creating a lively atmosphere.

As they entered, someone approached them. "Mr. Cavendish, long time no see."

William smiled. "Yeah, it's been a while. Christina, this is Nolan."

Christina greeted him, "Hi there!"

"This is the designer Mr. Cavendish spoke so highly of. He insisted on having you for this project. You must be very talented," Nolan looked Christina up and down, seemingly impressed.

"Nolan, you're too kind," Christina replied modestly.

"Mr. Cavendish rarely recommends someone so strongly. You two must have a special relationship?" Nolan asked with a gossipy tone.

Christina immediately responded gracefully, "We're just colleagues. Mr. Cavendish is already engaged, so let's not joke about that."

Nolan scratched his head. "Sorry about that."

He looked at Christina with admiration. "Ms. Windsor, would you like to join me for the opening dance?"

"She seems to be my date," William's tone was unusually calm, revealing no emotion.

Christina cleared her throat. "It's fine. As guests, it's only right to dance with Nolan."

She handed her hand to Nolan, and they entered the dance floor together.

Though Nolan wasn't particularly handsome and was in his thirties, he was witty and charming. "Ms. Windsor, when you walked in, I thought an angel had descended."

Christina couldn't help but laugh. "Do you often compliment people like this, Nolan?"

"I only compliment beautiful women," Nolan said with a smile.

Christina laughed even more.

Nolan suddenly stared into her eyes. "Ms. Windsor, someone as beautiful as you must already have a significant other, right?"

Christina glanced at William and deliberately said, "I'm too busy with work to focus on my personal life. But Nolan, you seem to have it all together. You must have a happy family."

"Actually, we're quite similar. I was so focused on work when I was younger that I forgot to get married and have kids," Nolan's gaze grew more intense.

Christina joked with a smile, "Then you better hurry up, Nolan."

Nolan's eyes never left her. "I never met anyone I liked before."

"And now? Have you met someone now?" Christina tilted her head and asked.

Before she could finish, the song ended, and William came over to pull her away.

"You seem to be enjoying yourself."

"What's with that look? Are you jealous?" Christina teased him.

William sneered. "You throw yourself at any rich guy. Christina, are you that cheap? Nolan already has a family."

Christina knew that, but she didn't care.

She just smiled lightly and said, "You seem more anxious than I am. Are you jealous of me getting close to other men?"

"You're overestimating yourself," William's cold eyes fixed on her.

"Good!" Christina shook off his hand.

She walked into the crowd, holding her glass and chatting confidently. When someone invited her to dance, she agreed without hesitation.

"Ms. Windsor, you are truly beautiful."

"Thank you for the compliment," Christina didn't know how many people she had danced with, but she moved gracefully like a butterfly throughout the evening.

###chapter 108  Harper, Whose Child Are You?

Christina kept glancing at William, who stood there with a dark expression, saying nothing.

She had been talking all night, and by the end, her voice was hoarse.

William couldn't take it anymore and yanked her back. "We're leaving."

"But the party's still going. Everyone's having a blast. How can I just leave?" Christina turned back, still looking smug.

She tilted her head. "Besides, you're the one who dragged me here. I'm finally having fun, and now you want to go?"

William narrowed his eyes, almost commanding, "Come with me."

Christina didn't want to agree, but he forcibly pulled her away. She had no choice but to wave goodbye to everyone.

The crowd exchanged puzzled looks.

He took her straight to the car, and she calmed down, giving him a cold look. "What do you want?"

"I've changed my mind," William said with a cold smile.

"What?" Christina frowned.

"You want money, right? Fine. From now on, you'll be my woman." William's deep eyes revealed an unreadable expression.

Christina sneered, raising an eyebrow. "What does that mean? You want me to be your mistress?"

"Did you think you could be my wife?" William laughed mockingly.

"Don't kid yourself," Christina said calmly. "I won't accept your terms, and I definitely won't be your wife."

If she had ever considered it, she wouldn't have let that child die before it was even born.

She closed her eyes, hiding the pain deep within them.

William saw her calm and resolute demeanor, a flicker of complex emotion in his eyes. His fingers tapped lightly on his knee, as if hesitating.

"Do you think you have a choice?"

Christina bit her lip, saying nothing.

William thought she had agreed and sneered, "Christina, you finally gave in."

He looked at her with a knowing smile, as if he had her all figured out.

Christina turned her face away, silent.

The car soon arrived at the hotel. William carried her out and up to the room.

Christina pulled out her room key. "Let's go to my room."

William's lips curled into a cold smile.

Christina, oh Christina, you're finally dropping the act, aren't you?

He didn't refuse. He swiped the key card and carried her into the room, throwing her onto the bed, leaning over her.

Christina's eyes were devoid of warmth.

She remained silent, staring at him with a look that made him uneasy.

Christina opened her arms and closed her eyes. "Sometimes I wonder, what do you really want, William?"

She had lived two lives but could never understand William.

In her past life, he thought she was scheming against him and hated her. In this life, she took everything upon herself and stayed far away from him, yet he still pursued her relentlessly.

William brushed a strand of hair from her face. "Isn't this what you wanted? Aren't you happy?"

His hot kiss quickly followed.

Christina took a deep breath, a tear silently falling from the corner of her eye.

She reached under the pillow for the fruit knife she had hidden there earlier.

Without hesitation, she raised the knife high and stabbed down hard.

"Ah!"

William recoiled in pain, clutching his shoulder where blood was now flowing, the pain tearing at his sanity.

"You!"

He glared at Christina.

He hadn't expected to see such intense hatred in her eyes, a hatred that wished him dead, that wanted to drag him to hell with her.

It was shocking.

Christina raised the knife again, ready for a second strike. He grabbed her hand. "Why do you hate me so much?"

"I just do, William. You ruined my life. Everything was finally on track." Christina gritted her teeth. "If you try anything today, one of us won't make it out alive."

William saw the truth in her eyes.

"Christina, would you really die?"

"Try me. I have my pride, William. If you dare to humiliate me again, I'll drag you to hell with me." Christina's eyes were filled with pure hatred as she spoke through gritted teeth.

If she couldn't escape William, she didn't want to live. Maybe in death, she could see Harper again.

William saw the hatred in her eyes, so intense it was terrifying. He threw the knife away and stumbled off the bed.

"Christina, you're something else."

He stared into her eyes for a long moment before turning and leaving.

Christina finally breathed a sigh of relief, collapsing onto the bed.

Tears fell silently, her heart aching as if cut by a knife.

She wrapped herself in the blanket, hoping sleep would numb her. Maybe if she slept, she wouldn't have to face this mess. Tomorrow would be a new day.

But she dreamed again, of Harper standing before her, tears streaming down her face, calling out, "Mommy, why did you leave me?"

Christina cried, "Mommy didn't leave you. Mommy had no choice. Harper, I wish you could be my daughter again."

"Harper, Harper!"

She woke up shouting, reaching out to find nothing but emptiness. It was just a dream.

Her longing peaked at that moment.

She got out of bed and went to the desk, using her pencil to draw Harper's face over and over.

The little girl she missed so much appeared on the paper, smiling.

She hugged the drawing tightly, tears streaming down. "Harper, I'm sorry, but I can't make the same mistake again."

If Harper was born to suffer, it was better she wasn't born at all.

But Christina didn't expect the door to open at that moment.

She turned in surprise to see William, his wound hastily bandaged, staring at her with cold eyes.

"Why are you still here? Get out. I don't want to see you."

William stepped forward, glancing at the drawing in her hand. "You were calling Harper's name in your sleep."

"It's none of your business," Christina said coldly, though her heart ached.

Harper had never known happiness with her. Even Harper's father, William, didn't care about her and had forgotten her. Only Christina remembered her.

William coldly demanded, "Who is Harper's father?"

###chapter 109  None of Your Business

"Why do you even care who the father of my child is?" Christina snapped back.

Back when Harper was alive, William never appreciated what he had. As a father, he failed to meet even the most basic responsibilities. If he had taken any responsibility for Harper, she would have been fine long ago. And now, William had the nerve to come asking about Harper? Did he even deserve to know?

"Christina," William's patience was wearing thin, his brow furrowed deeply. "Why do you always have to be so hostile when we talk? Can't we just have a normal conversation?"

He genuinely didn't want to argue with Christina. But Christina never spoke to him civilly!

Christina couldn't help but laugh out loud. "What kind of relationship do we have? I don't want to talk to you civilly, can't you see that? I don't even want to see you. Please, just disappear from my life completely."

This statement completely infuriated William. The more Christina acted like this, the more he wanted to know the truth. "You don't want to see me? Fine, from today on, you'll stay in the mansion and go nowhere!"

With a casual remark, he decided Christina's future. Of course, Christina wasn't willing to accept this. She had her own career to pursue. Why should she stay in the mansion as William's caged bird? No, she wasn't even a caged bird now; she was just his plaything.

William's attitude was firm. He grabbed her wrist and forcibly took her back to the master bedroom of the mansion. He threw Christina onto the bed and told her, "From now on, you'll live here. If you need anything, tell the housekeeper, and they'll get it for you."

"I'm a person, not your pet!" Christina climbed up from the bed. If looks could kill, William would have been dead a thousand times over by now.

Seeing the intense hatred in her eyes made William uncomfortable. "If you tell me the truth about who Harper's father is and where she is now, I might change my mind and give you your freedom."

"Forget it," Christina refused to say anything. William had no right to know anything about Harper. Even if she told the truth, would William believe her? Everyone would just think she was crazy or lying.

"Get some rest. When you calm down, we can talk," William said, turning to leave. Suddenly, a cup flew past him. If he hadn't dodged in time, it would have hit the back of his head.

Even the most patient person would be angry now. "Christina, are you trying to kill me?"

"If you don't want to die, stay far away from me. I'm telling you, either you never show up in front of me again, or you sleep with one eye open. If I get the chance, I won't hesitate to kill you," Christina wasn't threatening him; she was stating a fact. She used to just want to stay away from William, but now, she felt he deserved to die for Harper's sake.

"I think you're sick," William said, considering another possibility. Maybe she was ill?

He decided to have Joseph check on her later.

Seeing that Christina was about to throw more things, William left, but not before locking the door behind him.

After he left, Christina tried many ways to break the door or the windows. But everything in the mansion was of such high quality that she exhausted herself without success. Since that didn't work, she had to find another way.

Late at night, at the Cavendish Mansion.

Nicholas was still awake. He had called Raymond and Elisa to the study and was scolding them. "Are you two trying to drive me to my grave?"

"Nicholas, don't be angry," Raymond said with a pained expression. He wanted to go back to sleep but was afraid Nicholas might really get sick from anger. If that happened, he would be the sinner of the entire Cavendish family.

Nicholas sneered, "Look at what the Cavendish family has become online. How can I not be angry? How many times has this happened?"

The first time rumors about them spread, Nicholas helped suppress them. But he didn't expect another wave to follow so soon. He had sent them to the hospital to check if they were pregnant, and even that got photographed and posted online. Nicholas was almost driven to a heart attack.

"It was the entertainment reporters. They'd do anything for a story," Raymond dared not admit that he and Elisa had a hand in it.

Just then, Nicholas's phone rang. It was Christina. He wanted to hear what Christina had to say about this.

As soon as he answered, Christina's voice came through the phone. "Nicholas, can you control William?"

"What are you two fighting about now?" Nicholas was filled with anger. He thought this was another one of Christina's schemes.

Christina shouted, "He locked me in the mansion, restricting my freedom. Why? I'm a person, not a pet. Nicholas, can you make him let me out?"

So, William and Christina were together again? Nicholas's anger flared even more. "The whole internet is talking about you two, and you're still together."

"He forced me to stay here. I didn't come willingly. Nicholas, you should blame him," Christina didn't want to take the fall for this. Since she and William were completely at odds, the bigger the scene, the better. This way, Nicholas would be forced to save her to protect the Cavendish family's reputation.

"Nicholas, I told you they were a match made in heaven," Elisa added fuel to the fire.

Nicholas angrily hung up the phone. No matter what Christina's intentions were, he didn't have the energy to deal with it now. He'd handle it tomorrow.

But Christina wasn't giving up. Half an hour later, she called Nicholas again. This time, he didn't even answer. Fearing her number might be blocked, she made a huge commotion in the room, waking the housekeeper downstairs.

The housekeeper rushed in. "Ms. Windsor, what's going on?"

"Let me use your phone, or I'll bash my head against the wall," Christina pointed to the wall, ready to act.

###chapter 110  Do I Need to Inform You in Advance?

The nanny was terrified.

William had told her to keep a close eye on Christina, making sure she was safe. If anything happened to her, who would be held responsible?

The nanny quickly reached out to stop her. "Ms. Windsor, please don't do this. You want a phone, right? Here, take mine."

She swiftly pulled out her phone and handed it to Christina.

"Now, leave," Christina said, dismissing the nanny once she had the phone.

The nanny, afraid of upsetting her, complied without question.

As soon as she heard the door close, Christina called Nicholas. This time, using an unfamiliar number, Nicholas answered.

"Nicholas, I'm calling you repeatedly because I care about the Cavendish family's reputation. If you don't handle this, I'll call the police and let everyone know that William has kidnapped and confined his own niece," Christina threatened.

She had to make the situation sound serious; otherwise, who would take her seriously?

Nicholas was now wide awake.

He wasn't sure how much of Christina's claim was true, but one thing was certain: she was at William's villa.

They had done everything they shouldn't have, and now rumors were flying everywhere. Elisa kept insisting they were a perfect match.

"Stop causing trouble. How about I arrange for you two to get married? You can live at the Cavendish Mansion, and I'll personally take care of you. Once you have children, you can move out," Nicholas suggested, rubbing his temples.

Since he couldn't keep William and Christina apart, he might as well let them be together. It would save a lot of trouble, and he was too old to handle the chaos.

But this wasn't what Christina wanted. "Who wants to marry him? I want my freedom. He's already confined me. Are you going to force me to marry him at gunpoint? I absolutely refuse."

"Fine, if you don't agree, then forget it. I'll talk to him tomorrow. For tonight, just stay put and don't call me from another number again," Nicholas said, knowing he couldn't force a marriage.

He never wanted William and Christina together in the first place.

A forbidden romance, even without blood relations, would still be scandalous.

But their situation had become so public, trending multiple times, that he was exhausted and had agreed to compromise.

Since Christina was adamant about not marrying and wanted to distance herself from William, that was the best outcome for Nicholas.

He put his phone on silent and went to sleep.

The next morning, the first thing Nicholas did was call William back.

As soon as they met, Nicholas scolded him. "I raised you, and I've always thought you were a responsible person. What happened? Let Christina go immediately."

"What?" William frowned.

He had just brought Christina back to the villa yesterday. How did Nicholas find out so quickly?

"Look at this. She called me all night, keeping me awake. I even agreed to your marriage, but she refused. So, you two should stop seeing each other. I'll send her abroad," Nicholas said, tossing his phone to William.

Just looking at the call log from last night, it was clear Christina was desperate to escape the villa, trying every possible way.

But William didn't want to let her go.

"Christina is part of the Cavendish family. Once she's abroad, I'll give her enough money to live comfortably for the rest of her life. You need to find a proper partner and stop this nonsense," Nicholas had already planned their futures.

If William followed his plan, they would never see each other again, avoiding any further complications.

Without hesitation, William refused. "I don't agree."

"Then what do you want?" Nicholas asked. "You won't let her go, and she won't marry you. Do you plan to continue this scandalous relationship? Even if you two don't care about shame, I have my pride. You have one day to figure this out. No more delays."

William knew this was Nicholas's final offer.

He said nothing more, planning to bring Joseph, a professional doctor, to help Christina open up and understand what was happening.

Meanwhile, Christina had been waiting for Nicholas's call since morning, but by noon, there was still no news.

Finally, her phone rang.

She quickly picked it up, but her face fell when she saw the caller ID.

It wasn't Nicholas; it was Kelvin.

She answered, "Kelvin, what can I do for you?"

"I have good news. We've got several big projects at the architecture firm, and we're short-handed. I want you to take charge of one," Kelvin said.

"That's great! Thank you for trusting me. I'll make sure to do a great job," Christina replied happily.

This project would not only earn her a substantial commission but also boost her reputation. It was a win-win situation.

After discussing the project, Christina put down her phone.

Looking around at the familiar surroundings, she realized something important. She was confined in William's villa, unable to leave, with nannies watching her every move.

Kelvin had given her a big project, but without her freedom, how could she complete it?

She needed to escape quickly.

Before she could devise a plan, William returned with Joseph.

"Why did you bring him here?" Christina felt a sense of dread.

Joseph set down his medical kit and put on gloves. "I'm a doctor. What do you think I'm here for? To treat you. Should we talk in your room or here in the living room?"

"Here in the living room," William wanted to see what was going on with Christina.

Joseph agreed.

Seeing them make all the arrangements, Christina sneered. "You two always think you know best. Did you ever ask for my opinion?"

"Come on, I'm here to treat you. Do I need your permission to do my job?" Joseph replied, exasperated.

###chapter 111 Wrist Slitting Suicide

If it weren't for William, Joseph wouldn't have shown up, even if Christina had invited him herself.

"I'm not sick," Christina snapped, her face flushed with anger.

Joseph didn't buy it for a second. "You won't know until you get checked out. I'm a doctor; I know better than you."

"I said I'm not sick. Do you think I can't tell if something's wrong with me?" Christina struggled to keep her temper in check.

These two really didn't understand the meaning of "respect."

The more defiant she was, the more Joseph felt he was right to come today.

He sat down on the couch, ready to give her some psychological counseling.

The next second, Christina grabbed a fruit knife from the table and held it to her wrist. "Both of you, get out."

"Ms. Windsor, don't do anything rash," the housekeeper rushed over, trying to stop her.

William was also afraid she might actually hurt herself.

Only Joseph remained unmoved.

He just sat there, looking at Christina with a playful glint in his eyes. "If you have the guts, go ahead and cut. Stop trying to scare us. This isn't the old days; that trick doesn't work anymore."

Even if you beat him to death, Joseph wouldn't believe Christina was really going to commit suicide.

In the end, Christina was just trying to force William to give in to her demands.

"Christina, stop this nonsense. Joseph is an excellent doctor. Having him counsel you won't do you any harm," William said, half-convinced she wouldn't actually go through with it, but still a bit scared.

Christina's hatred for him wasn't fake. If she got too emotional and really cut herself, the consequences would be unimaginable.

"You just want to say I'm crazy, right? It's ridiculous. When I wanted to be close to you, you pushed me away. Now that I want to stay away, you want to lock me up and call my refusal a mental breakdown," Christina said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

Why did she ever get involved with someone like William in the first place?

It wasn't just William and Joseph who had hurt Harper; she had too. If she had been more clear-headed, Harper wouldn't have suffered so much.

"Then what?" Joseph recalled their first meeting.

He was still angry. "I don't even know how I offended you, but you were so hostile towards me. In medical terms, that's called paranoia."

"Let me examine you first, see how bad it is, and then I'll prescribe some medication. Slowly, your emotions will stabilize."

Every word he said was a blow to Christina.

She had completely given up on communicating with these two. She slashed her wrist, and blood gushed out.

Joseph was stunned.

He couldn't believe his eyes. How could this be happening?

"Call an ambulance! Ms. Windsor is bleeding a lot. Where are the bandages?" The housekeeper was the first to react, rushing to support Christina while shouting.

William immediately called for an ambulance.

Joseph found some bandages in the medical kit and tried to dress Christina's wound, but she refused to cooperate.

She told William, "Just because other women like you doesn't mean I do. I will never marry you. I'd rather die than be tied to someone like you for life."

To her, that was worse than death.

Joseph was even more shocked. He had always thought Christina was the one forcing William into marriage, but it turned out to be the other way around.

As a doctor, he hadn't noticed the patient's distress and had even aggravated it. He felt he had failed his profession.

At that moment, it felt like a mountain was pressing down on him, making him feel suffocated and miserable.

"Let's get you to the hospital first. We can talk about everything else later," William said, just wanting her to stay alive.

Christina was adamant.

"Later? When exactly is later? What if you change your mind once I'm better? Then wouldn't I have cut myself for nothing?"

She was resolute. "I won't go to the hospital unless you promise never to bother me again."

"I promise. Once you're better, you can stay or leave as you wish. I won't interfere," William conceded.

She had lost so much blood that if they didn't stop the bleeding soon, he feared she wouldn't make it until the ambulance arrived.

As Christina began to lose consciousness from the blood loss, Joseph quickly bandaged her wound.

When the ambulance arrived, they all went to the hospital together.

Christina was rushed to the emergency room, while William and Joseph waited in the hallway.

"What the hell is going on between you two? William, you told me Christina was sick, but she just said you were forcing her into marriage. Even if you love her to death, this is too much," Joseph said, utterly confused.

And Christina too.

She didn't act like she loved William. What had happened to make her change so drastically?

"That's exactly what I can't figure out," William said with a bitter smile. "She hates me now, really hates me. And she seems to have a child named Harper with someone else, but I don't know who the man is or where the child is."

"What are you thinking? She has a child with someone else, and you still want to marry her?" Joseph wasn't prejudiced against her.

But Christina was so young, not even graduated, and already had an illegitimate child. What was going on?

And William.

He couldn't possibly marry a woman with a child.

William shook his head. "I don't have that thought now. I just want to understand what happened. And that child, when was it born?"

Having a child isn't something that happens overnight; it takes at least ten months. Christina hiding this from the entire Cavendish family wasn't easy.

"Are you sure the child exists?" Joseph thought for a moment and offered a reasonable guess. "Given her drastic change and paranoia, is it possible the child is a figment of her imagination?"

If that were the case, everything would make sense.

The child didn't exist, so William couldn't find any trace of it. And Christina's hostility towards him was because of this imaginary child.

William thought carefully. "You might be right. So what do you think I should do now?"

###chapter 112  How Are You So Capable?

Today's events had completely shaken William.

He no longer dared to be as harsh with Christina as before, nor did he dare to restrict her freedom.

But if he let Christina go, she would refuse to see him and might even leave the country.

"Let's give her some time to cool off. Right now, she's not willing to cooperate, and even the best psychologist wouldn't be able to help. Don't push her too hard. Also, I want to apologize for my earlier behavior," Joseph said, but before he could finish, the door to the operating room opened, and the doctor walked out.

"Who's the patient's family?" the doctor asked the two men standing there.

"I am," William quickly stepped forward. "How is Christina?"

"She's out of danger now. You can go see her, but you need to be mindful of her emotions. Don't upset her again. Many patients who attempt suicide do so again after being discharged, often because their families don't understand them," the doctor advised carefully.

Having seen too many similar tragedies over the years, he hoped to reduce their occurrence as much as possible.

"Thank you, doctor," William said sincerely.

Joseph, standing nearby, felt even more ashamed of his earlier actions. He didn't feel worthy of calling himself a doctor.

After the doctor left, the two of them went to Christina's room.

She was lying in bed, her wrists wrapped in bandages, her face pale, and her lips colorless, clearly from blood loss.

Seeing them, Christina reacted strongly, "Get out!"

"Don't get upset. I shouldn't have said those things earlier. I apologize. Since you don't want to see me now, I'll leave," Joseph said and then left the room.

Now, only William and Christina were left.

William asked her, "You'd rather die than stay with me?"

"Yes, I hate you. Can't you tell?" Christina didn't hide her disgust.

She thought she had made it very clear.

William didn't know what to say. He was afraid of upsetting her again, but letting her go left him with an indescribable sense of loss.

He glanced at the clock on the wall. "You didn't have dinner. I'll go get you something to eat."

While he was out getting food, Nicholas arrived with Raymond and Elisa.

Pushing open the door, Nicholas was furious at the sight of Christina. "You call me in the middle of the night and now you're trying to kill yourself? Christina, how could you be so capable?"

He regretted agreeing to Raymond marrying Elisa. If it weren't for that, the Cavendish family wouldn't have Christina, who had the ability to turn their lives upside down.

"Nicholas, why are you here?" Christina's first thought was that William had betrayed her.

William must have alerted Nicholas to try to control her.

William was truly despicable.

"You two caused such a scene. Of course, I had to keep an eye on you. Good thing I did. If the media had found out you were in the hospital, it would have been a scandal," Nicholas snapped, clearly irritated.

He had thought he was in good health, but Christina was going to be the death of him.

"Christina, apologize to Nicholas and stop this nonsense," Elisa urged, standing by her bed.

To Elisa, Nicholas agreeing to their marriage was a huge deal. It meant Christina would be firmly established in the Cavendish family.

Gabrielle would have to be polite to Elisa, maybe even beg for her favor.

Christina looked at Elisa without saying a word.

This was her mother, who never understood her and never took her side.

Elisa was stubborn, always believing that a woman's greatest achievement was finding a good husband. As long as her husband made money, she thought she had won at life.

But living with someone you don't love is torture.

"Christina, listen to your mother. Apologize to Nicholas, get well, and marry William. I'll help you pick out a wedding dress. It's the most important day of a woman's life, and we need to choose a beautiful dress," Elisa continued, thinking Christina was listening.

Christina's head hurt from her nagging. "I just slit my wrists, and you're still pushing me to marry. Do I have to die in front of you for you to stop?"

"How can you say that? I'm doing this for your own good," Elisa felt unappreciated and worried about offending Nicholas.

In her panic, Elisa felt a sharp pain in her stomach.

She tried to endure it, but the pain grew worse until she could barely stand, needing to lean against the wall. "Even Nicholas isn't as angry as I am."

"Then you don't have to care about me. I have my own life. Why do you insist on making me live like you?" Christina said, just as Elisa raised her hand to slap her.

At that moment, Christina lost the will to communicate.

It was pointless to talk; she might as well save her breath.

Elisa wanted to say more, but the pain in her abdomen was so severe she couldn't stand straight. Raymond noticed and rushed over. "What's wrong? Are you upset?"

"No, my stomach hurts," Elisa shook her head.

Seeing her condition, Raymond helped her up. "Let's go see a doctor downstairs. We're already at the hospital. We'll come back after."

Given Elisa's state, staying in the room wouldn't help, so it was better to see a doctor.

Elisa agreed.

She had had stomach pains before, thinking it was just gastritis from irregular eating. But today's pain was so intense she couldn't help but fear the worst.

Nicholas watched them leave and told Christina, "You saw your mother's condition. If she's really sick, staying with the Cavendish family will ensure she gets the best medical care. If you keep acting out, don't you care about Elisa's well-being?"

###chapter 113 Late-Stage Stomach Cancer

Although Nicholas didn't spell it out, Christina got the message loud and clear.

If she played nice and followed orders, Elisa would stay the Cavendish daughter-in-law and get top-notch medical care.

If she didn't, Elisa would lose all the perks of being part of the Cavendish family.

It was a clear threat.

Christina knew Nicholas had his ways.

He had led the Cavendish family to where they were now; a man like him wasn't a fool.

If he wanted to deal with her, it would be a piece of cake.

But there was one thing she couldn't wrap her head around. "I know you don't think much of me. Otherwise, you wouldn't have fought so hard to keep me away from William before. Now that I want to leave him, why won't you let me?"

It seemed like a win-win for both of them.

She'd get her freedom, and Nicholas could find a fiancée for William that he actually liked.

"Before, your relationship wasn't public. Only the family knew. If you two split, it wouldn't have any impact. But now, rumors about you two are everywhere," Nicholas explained bluntly.

"You're an adult now. You have to take responsibility for your actions. The Cavendish family's reputation is on the line. It's not about being together when you want and breaking up when you feel like it."

Christina was at a loss for words.

She felt a deep sadness. Ultimately, she wasn't powerful enough yet, which was why she was at the mercy of others.

"After you two get married, if you want kids, have them. I'll help take care of them. If you don't want kids, that's fine too. Whether you want to be a housewife or pursue your own career, it's up to you. If you choose the latter, I'll personally bring you into our family business," Nicholas said, thinking he was offering her a good deal.

He couldn't understand what more Christina could want.

"Nicholas, do I have the right to say no?" Christina's heart was filled with bitterness.

If she had heard this offer in her past life, she would have been overjoyed.

But thinking of Harper and her tragic past life, these conditions held no appeal for her.

She worked hard to earn money and build her career to have the power to choose, to avoid being with someone she disliked. If she agreed to Nicholas's terms, wouldn't that betray her original intention?

"You're not a child anymore. I don't need to spell everything out. I'll go check on your mother now," Nicholas said, leaving the rest for Christina to mull over.

Christina didn't have much affection for her biological mother, Elisa, and Elisa didn't understand her at all.

But no matter what, Elisa was still her mother. She couldn't completely abandon her.

Choosing herself or her mother was a dilemma, and either choice felt wrong.

Not long after, Raymond came up alone, holding a medical report with a serious expression. "Your mom's test results are back."

"How is it?" Christina hadn't seen the report yet, but Raymond's expression told her the results were far from good.

Raymond took a moment to gather himself before handing her the report. "Stage IV stomach cancer. The doctor says she needs to be hospitalized immediately. If we delay any longer, treatment won't be possible."

Christina stared at the report over and over.

She wished it was a joke or that Elisa was lying to trick her.

"Today was just a preliminary test. We'll need to go to other hospitals for further confirmation. If it's confirmed, the chemotherapy will cost a lot. You know our family's financial situation," Raymond continued.

His meaning was clear: he hoped Christina would bow to Nicholas, so Elisa could receive the Cavendish family's medical support.

"And William is an excellent man. He's tall, handsome, and has many women wanting to be with him. You two aren't that far apart in age."

Raymond couldn't understand why Christina had such a big issue with William.

He wasn't the only one puzzled.

Christina felt a deep sense of grievance but had no one to confide in. She remained silent, battling internally.

In the end, her heart leaned towards Elisa.

She couldn't bear to watch her mother die and do nothing. She couldn't carry the weight of a human life on her conscience.

"I understand. Let's get her hospitalized as soon as possible," Christina said, not making her thoughts too clear.

Raymond's eyes lit up with joy. "I knew you were sensible. Rest well and get better. I'll go tell your mom the good news."

When William returned with food, he found Christina looking despondent.

He placed the food next to her. "The food here is pretty light. It's just right for you. Give it a try."

Christina opened the container, took a bite, and suddenly said, "Now you're finally satisfied."

"What?" William didn't understand what she meant.

He had no idea what had just happened. To him, Christina had been very resistant to him, and now she was saying this.

Christina didn't explain.

After eating, she said she wanted to be discharged.

"No way. You're not fully recovered yet. You need to stay a few more days," William immediately refused.

He was afraid Christina would attempt suicide again if she went home.

At least in the hospital, there were monitors and medical staff. If something happened, they could respond quickly.

Christina knew what he was worried about. "Don't worry. I won't try to kill myself again. I'll behave and stay by your side."

"Christina, don't say the opposite of what you mean," William said, feeling even more uneasy.

Christina forced a smile. Even William knew what she was thinking.

But what good did it do for him to know?

In the Cavendish family, reputation was more important than her. William was more important than her. Even her own mother wanted her to compromise. What could she do alone against all of this?

"There are so many servants at home, all your spies. Are you really afraid you can't keep an eye on me?"

"You'll be discharged the day after tomorrow. Stay in the hospital for two more days. I don't want your wrist wound to get infected," William said, giving her a deadline.

Most of the day had already passed. Staying one more day wasn't a big deal. Christina agreed.

She wanted to take this opportunity to ask her mother what she thought.

###chapter 114 I Absolutely Cannot Leave the Cavendish Family

William wanted to stay longer at the hospital to spend more time with Christina.

But given his position at the company, there were just too many things that needed his attention. His assistant's calls kept coming in one after another, and he had to return to the office.

Before leaving, he repeatedly reminded Christina, "If you need anything, just tell the caregiver. She'll be here soon. If you feel uncomfortable, press the call button, and the nurse will come right away. I hope the next time I see you, you'll be in better shape."

"Yeah, yeah, I got it. Just go already," Christina replied impatiently.

She didn't need William's concern at all right now.

Where was he when she needed him in her past life? Having lived through it all again, she had long since accumulated enough disappointment and had no expectations of him. Yet now, he seemed so concerned about her.

His belated concern was worth less than trash on the street.

"Christina, I meant every word I said. If you harm yourself, the Cavendish family will refuse to provide medical care for your mother. You know her condition. She is your biological mother," William said, still uneasy.

He brought up Elisa again, trying to use her as a tether to keep Christina in line.

Christina's heart had long since grown numb from the pain. She looked up at him, "Nicholas already told me that. You don't need to repeat it. I'm not an idiot. If you're leaving, just go. Can you let me have some peace?"

She really hated these threats.

Even if she had everything she needed here, and Nicholas promised to personally bring her into the family business, losing her freedom made her feel like a caged bird. She couldn't live like this.

William didn't say anything more.

As soon as he left, the caregiver he had arranged arrived. She was a woman in her forties who immediately started tidying up the room. "Ms. Windsor, you can call me Kenna."

"Got it," Christina said, having no particular opinion about the new caregiver.

But she knew very well that William had hurriedly arranged for a caregiver to keep an eye on her.

Because of this, it was hard for her to be friendly to Kenna, and her tone was cold. "I'm going out for a bit. I'll be back soon."

"Ms. Windsor, your wounds haven't healed yet. How about I accompany you? I can help if anything happens," Kenna said, quickly following her.

Kenna was worried about Christina getting into trouble and also feared she might take the opportunity to run away.

Christina didn't want any more complications.

If Kenna called William, who knew how much more trouble that would cause.

"I'm going downstairs to see my mom. You can come with me, but wait outside when we get there," she said, allowing Kenna to follow.

The two of them left the room, and soon Christina took the elevator downstairs. She pushed open the door to find that Raymond had already gone to work, leaving Elisa alone in the room.

"Christina, what are you doing here?" Elisa's first reaction was to persuade her, "You see my condition. If you don't find a good man to take care of you now, what will you do after I'm gone?"

"I'm old enough to take care of myself," Christina replied, though she left one thing unsaid.

Maybe everyone thought that if she married William, she would be lucky and have a life of endless blessings.

But only she knew how much she had suffered in her past life. So many long nights, she slept holding her child, her tears soaking the pillow.

"I can take care of myself, and I can make money. Buying a car, a house, even covering your medical expenses is no problem. Mom, why can't you believe in me?"

"But you're at an age where you can't stay single forever," Elisa insisted on her own views.

Christina realized she couldn't get through to her and decided not to dwell on it. "Mom, I'm planning to leave here. What about you?"

If Elisa was willing to leave with her, she would forget the past and earn money with her own hands to cover all of Elisa's medical expenses.

Their life might be poorer than staying with the Cavendish family, but at least they would be free and not so oppressed.

Elisa was stunned for a moment, then disapproved, "Now that I'm married to Raymond and you're about to marry William, our lives have finally gotten better. And you want to leave the Cavendish family? Are you out of your mind?"

"I've worked so hard to pave the way for you, hoping your life would be easier. And now you want to take me away from here? Are you crazy?"

Elisa grew more and more agitated.

"I've been diagnosed with late-stage cancer. Even with the best treatment, I might not live long, maybe just a few years. You're my daughter, my closest person, and you want to take away the few stable years I have left?"

Christina didn't know what to say.

The freedom she longed for was seen as deliberate troublemaking by her mother.

"Since I'm married into the Cavendish family, I won't leave. You should stop causing trouble and don't make a terminally ill mother worry about you all the time!" Elisa delivered another heavy blow.

Christina suddenly felt her visit was in vain.

Their views were different, and their life plans were completely opposite. She shouldn't try to change her mother's mind. "You think staying with the Cavendish family is a happy life, right?"

"Yes, this is the life I've always dreamed of," Elisa replied without hesitation.

Christina stood up. "Got it. I need to get an IV, so I'll head back."

Since Elisa didn't want to leave, so be it.

As her daughter, Christina couldn't force Elisa to make a choice against her will. She could only take care of herself first and try to look after Elisa as much as possible.

Back in her own room, Christina lay on the bed, seemingly resting with her eyes closed, but she was actually thinking of a plan.

Because of Elisa's illness, she couldn't break ties with the Cavendish family directly or act recklessly as before. But she couldn't just compromise either.

She needed to find a solution that worked for both of them.

In the evening, Kenna came over and asked, "Ms. Windsor, what would you like for dinner? I can go out and get it for you."

"I'm not hungry. I'll skip dinner."

Kenna persisted, "How about some fruit? I can make a fruit platter for you. You should eat something, even just a little."

###chapter 115 Why Are You Fasting Again?

Christina kept refusing to eat.

She just didn't want to, and Kenna couldn't exactly force her to open her mouth and shove food in.

"Ms. Windsor, why don't you close your eyes and rest for a bit? If you get hungry, just let me know," Kenna suggested, moving to a chair in the corner and pulling out her phone to update William on the day's events.

William was in the middle of a meeting at the office.

When he saw his phone light up, he glanced at it, and his expression immediately turned serious.

Christina wasn't eating again?

He instinctively thought Christina was throwing a tantrum with the nurse, deliberately harming her own body. This couldn't go on!

"Meeting's over," William announced, standing up and leaving.

He drove to the hospital as fast as he could. He considered buying a meal from a nearby restaurant but decided to call the housekeeper instead. "Can you prepare a nutritious meal and bring it to the hospital? Make sure it's something light."

No matter how good the food outside was, it couldn't compare to the fresh, clean, and nutritious meals from home. Given Christina's current condition, she needed the best.

After making these arrangements, he headed upstairs to see Christina.

"Mr. Cavendish, you're here," Kenna said, stepping aside to leave the room for William and Christina.

Christina's eyes were still closed, her brows slightly furrowed.

He really was like a ghost that wouldn't leave.

She wanted to avoid talking to him, but William walked straight to her bedside and sat down. "I know you're not asleep. Stop pretending."

"Can't I just rest for a bit?" Christina looked up at him.

"I'm not stopping you from resting, but I won't agree to you starving yourself. We already agreed that you'd be discharged tomorrow. What more do you want?" William couldn't understand what she was upset about.

Hadn't he tried to meet all her demands?

Christina's expression remained indifferent. "I'm not protesting by starving myself. I'm just not hungry right now. You can't control when I eat, can you?"

Even pets at home could eat whenever they wanted. Why should she have a set meal time?

William's brow furrowed, his eyes growing stern. "Christina, don't play these games with me. I know you too well."

"Really? You know me?" Christina laughed as if she'd heard a joke.

If he really knew her, what had he been doing in their past life?

Despite living another life, she had grown further from him, and their interactions had decreased significantly. Yet, he was saying this now.

He was so hypocritical.

"I can't handle your so-called understanding, William. Sometimes I really don't know what you're thinking. You say you don't like me, so why won't you let me go? You insisted on marrying me, but after the wedding, you won't cherish me. Instead, you'll torment me to death."

"Christina!" William interrupted her.

He looked incredulous. "What nonsense are you talking about?"

No matter how much he disliked Christina, she was still Raymond's daughter. He would never bully her because of that connection.

Besides, he wasn't some kind of pervert with a weird fetish. Why would he make life difficult for his own wife?

"I think you really need to see a psychologist," William said, exasperated. He couldn't think of any other explanation.

Christina's hostility and prejudice against him were completely unfounded.

He hadn't done anything wrong or hurt her. Why did she see him as the bad guy?

"Yeah, I'm sick. So please, be considerate of a patient and stay away from me. Don't make it worse. Can you do that?" Christina didn't want to argue with him, so she went along with his words.

"I'll leave, but you have to eat properly," William bargained.

Compared to being in the same room with someone she disliked, eating was a pleasure for Christina.

Besides, how could she have the strength to escape if she didn't eat?

She chose the latter. "Fine, give me the food. I'll eat it myself."

To be sure, William watched her finish the meal before he left.

He didn't go straight home but went to see Joseph.

It happened to be Joseph's shift that night, and with no patients around, Joseph had ordered some takeout and invited William to his office. "What brings you here tonight?"

"I told you before, I suspect Christina has a psychological issue. Now I think it's getting worse," William said, clearly troubled.

"Do you have any way to make her act more normal, at least stop hating me so much?"

Joseph shrugged. "We've been friends for so long, but there's nothing I can do. She doesn't just hate you; she has a grudge against me too. I can't figure out what I did to offend her."

Maybe it's like those online theories about people being destined enemies?

If the problem couldn't be solved, maybe they should address the root cause.

"She seems to get along fine with others, right? Maybe you should just stay away from her," Joseph suggested, thinking it was the simplest solution.

With William's status, he wouldn't have trouble finding women. Why insist on being with Christina?

William glared at him. "Is that how you treat patients? Telling their families to stay away from them? If word got out, you'd be famous for all the wrong reasons."

Joseph knew he had a point. "I was just joking. Give it some time. When Christina's condition improves, I'll help you figure it out. Right now, I'm honestly scared of her."

A patient who might actually attempt suicide was terrifying for any doctor.

William's unease grew.

He had a nagging feeling that if he didn't change Christina's view of him soon, he would lose her for good.

He asked Joseph, "What do women her age usually like?"

"You're asking me?" Joseph pointed to himself, more shocked than William. "Come on, you should ask women her age. I'm a bachelor. How would I know?"

"You're right," William agreed, not pressing Joseph further.

After thinking it over, he decided Jennifer was the best person to ask. She was around Christina's age, so their interests should be similar.

###chapter 116  Unwillingness in the Heart

Jennifer had told William countless times how much she wanted to get along with Christina.

With that in mind, William arranged to meet Jennifer the next morning.

When she got his call, Jennifer was so excited she couldn't sleep all night. She got up early, carefully did her makeup, dressed up, and arrived at the office building. "Hey, William, you wanted to see me?"

"How about we head to the café next door?" William suggested.

Jennifer eagerly agreed.

She couldn't help but wonder why William had called her out today. What did he want to talk about?

Could it be...

Her cheeks flushed at the thought.

Once they were seated in the café, William ordered two coffees and then asked, "So, what do girls your age usually like?"

"Well, we generally like things like pets, makeup, and jewelry, but it really depends on personal taste. William, are you planning to buy a gift for someone?" Jennifer's heart was a mix of anticipation and anxiety.

She desperately hoped the gift was for her.

But sometimes, the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment.

William, unaware of her thoughts, said straightforwardly, "I want to get something for Christina."

He didn't expect Christina to be overly friendly, but at least he wanted to improve their current strained relationship.

Jennifer's smile vanished instantly, and her hands clenched tightly at her sides, her nails digging into her palms without her even feeling the pain.

A gift for Christina?

Why her?

"William, since when did you two get so close? I remember you didn't like her at all before. And last time at the beach, she even pushed me into the sea," Jennifer couldn't help but bring up old grievances.

She wanted to remind William that Christina was a bad person and not worth giving gifts to.

But her words only made William frown. "Didn't we already move past that? You told me yourself at the hospital that you didn't want to hold a grudge against Christina."

Jennifer had indeed said that, but it was only to appear magnanimous and make William feel more sympathetic towards her.

Now she was stuck. If she went back on her words, she'd be admitting she was a liar.

She had no choice but to swallow her anger. "William, I really don't want to hold a grudge, but you used to dislike her so much. Did she do something to force you?"

"Jennifer, why would you think that?" Even William, as dense as he could be, sensed something was off.

Jennifer's behavior now seemed completely different from the kind-hearted woman he remembered.

"I just don't want you to be hurt," Jennifer tried to say more.

William stood up. "I have other things to do. I'll be going now."

He decided to stop asking others and instead look online for gift ideas to mend their relationship.

Watching him leave, Jennifer's face twisted with resentment.

She had worked so hard to make William despise Christina, hoping he would kick her out of the Cavendish family for good.

But now?

If William and Christina ended up together, Jennifer would be nothing more than a witness to their love, a ridiculous clown.

No, she couldn't let that happen.

A fierce glint flashed in Jennifer's eyes. Christina was standing in her way and had no idea what she was up against.

Meanwhile, Christina was at the hospital, wanting to handle her discharge papers, but Kenna insisted she wait for William.

She felt utterly frustrated.

It was as if she wasn't a person but a possession, needing someone else's permission for every move.

Finally, when William arrived after finishing his work, Christina greeted him with sarcasm. "You finally showed up. If you hadn't remembered me, would I have been stuck in the hospital forever?"

It reminded her of her past life, where William ignored her and their child, leading them to a dead end.

The thought made her sick.

"The company was busy today. I'll help you with the discharge papers and then take you home," William said, not wanting to argue.

He had prepared gifts for Christina at home, hoping they would make her less hostile.

But reality was far from his expectations.

When Christina walked into the house and saw the gifts on the table, she felt no joy and had no intention of opening them.

As she was about to walk past the table, William called out, "Christina, these are all for you. Open them."

Christina stopped.

She quickly unwrapped all the gifts, looked at the table full of presents, and said flatly, "Return them. I don't need any of this."

"Christina!" William couldn't help but raise his voice.

Who reacts like this to receiving gifts?

"Or you could give them to Jennifer. I'm tired and need to rest. I don't have time for this," Christina turned and walked away, not sparing him any dignity.

He thought he could change her attitude with these things. He was delusional.

Unless Harper could get better.

But in this life, Harper hadn't been born yet, so Christina would never be kind to William, and their relationship would never improve.

William couldn't force a patient to stay, so after Christina left, he stormed into his study, working through the night without sleep.

The next morning, the housekeeper prepared breakfast, and William personally went to call Christina.

Christina, not wanting to sit at the same table as him, made an excuse. "I need more sleep. Have the housekeeper bring my breakfast to my room in an hour."

William had to go to work during the day and couldn't stay home.

So an hour later, he would be gone, and she wouldn't have to see his annoying face.

"Alright, make sure you eat," William reminded her before leaving.

After he left, Christina lounged comfortably in bed until the housekeeper brought her breakfast.

After eating, she expressed a desire to go shopping at the mall.

The housekeeper initially tried to stop her, but Christina retorted, "Do I not even have the freedom to go out now?"

###chapter 117 Are You Still Conscious Now?

At the hospital, nurses were always around to take care of her. Once she was discharged and back home, a nanny was there to keep an eye on her. Her situation was really sad and pitiful.

"Ms. Windsor, I don't want to be a pain, but you just got out of the hospital. Are you sure you should be going out?" the nanny asked, looking worried.

If Christina went out and something happened, William would blame everyone. But if she kept stopping Christina, she'd be in trouble too.

"That's exactly why I need to get out for a bit. Staying cooped up at home is gonna drive me crazy," Christina insisted.

Word of this quickly got to William.

He didn't want Christina wandering around, but he also didn't want her to get sick from being stuck at home. In the end, he reluctantly agreed.

To be safe, he had a bodyguard follow her discreetly. If anything happened, the bodyguard could step in right away.

Christina had no idea about this.

After leaving home, she called a car to take her to a nearby mall. She wandered around for a while and then found a place to eat.

At the next table, a group of female students were chatting about their vacation plans. Hearing them made Christina feel even worse.

She longed for freedom, to be unrestrained.

Maybe in a while, William couldn't keep such a close watch on her forever. Once she found the right moment, she could leave.

Perhaps her diet had been too bland lately. Eating a burger today upset her stomach, and after just a few bites, she felt a sharp pain in her abdomen.

She quickly went to the mall's public restroom.

After taking care of her needs, she came out to wash her hands. A shy young girl, clearly a student, approached her. "Excuse me, could you help me with something?"

"Sure, what do you need?" Christina asked.

The girl hesitantly held out a tampon, her face turning bright red. "I don't know how to use this. I'm scared, and I didn't bring any pads with me today. I don't know what to do."

Christina knew how to use tampons and patiently explained, but the girl kept shaking her head, eventually tearing up in frustration.

"I'm so stupid. I just can't understand. I shouldn't have bought tampons."

"How about this? You go into the stall, and I'll go buy some pads for you. I'll bring them right back," Christina suggested.

The girl was incredibly grateful, thanking her repeatedly. "Thank you so much. I'll be in the last stall, waiting for you."

Christina hurried to buy the pads and quickly returned.

She knocked on the stall door. "I got what you needed."

The girl opened the door. "Can you come in and check if I got blood on my clothes?"

"Sure, I'll help you check." As Christina stepped in, the girl closed the stall door behind her.

Instead of turning around, the girl swiftly pulled out a syringe from her pocket and injected it into Christina's arm.

"You..."

"I'm really sorry, but I owe a lot of money and can't pay it back. If I don't do this, my photos will be leaked. I'm still a student; I can't ruin my reputation," the girl apologized, but her actions were quick and precise.

She injected all the liquid into Christina's body, then discarded the syringe. "You were so kind to buy pads for me. I hope you can forgive me."

Even if Christina didn't forgive her, she had no choice. She was desperate.

With her task complete, the girl put on a hat and sunglasses from her backpack and quickly left the restroom.

Christina tried to help herself, but the drug took effect, and she soon lost all strength, eventually passing out.

The bodyguard waiting outside sensed something was wrong.

It had been over half an hour since Christina went in. She couldn't have slipped away, could she?

The bodyguard decided to check.

The restroom was mostly empty, with all the stall doors open except the last one.

The bodyguard pushed the door open and found Christina unconscious on the floor.

She knelt down and gently shook Christina's arm. "Ms. Windsor, can you hear me?"

There was no response, the answer was clear.

The bodyguard wasted no time, calling an ambulance and then carrying Christina out of the mall as quickly as possible.

On the way to the hospital, the bodyguard called William. "Mr. Cavendish, Ms. Windsor suddenly passed out in the restroom. I'm taking her to the hospital now."

"How did she suddenly pass out?" William's brow furrowed deeply.

When they discharged her, he had the doctors run a full check-up to ensure she was healthy. How could she pass out so soon after?

Thank goodness he had a bodyguard follow her. Who knows what could have happened otherwise?

"I don't know. Ms. Windsor has a high fever now. We'll need to wait for the doctors to examine her to find out."

William's worry grew.

He dropped everything and rushed to the hospital. Christina was already in the emergency room.

At that moment, he only hoped she would be okay.

Fortunately, the outcome was as he wished. After treatment, most of the drug was flushed out of Christina's system.

The emergency doctor, the same one from before, recognized both Christina and William. "What's going on with you two? Last time it was a wrist cut, now it's poison. I'm starting to think you need police protection."

"What kind of poison?" William's heart tightened.

Who was trying to harm Christina?

She had only been out for a few hours and was already drugged. He shouldn't have let her go out.

If she stayed home, she wouldn't be in danger.

"It's a banned substance, very harmful to the body. Luckily, it was caught in time. You should stay away from suspicious people in your daily life," the doctor advised, making William take the situation even more seriously.

He had to find out who was behind this to ensure she wouldn't be harmed again.

###chapter 118  My Business, None of Your Concern

After talking with the doctor, William headed to the hospital room. Seeing Christina's pale face, his tone softened with concern, "You still feeling sick?"

"This is my business, not yours," Christina snapped back.

Her attitude stung William once again.

His voice was hoarse, "Can you stop being so harsh with me? Let's just move on from the past. We're getting married soon. We can't keep acting like this after we're married."

To be honest, their relationship felt more like enemies than an engaged couple.

Especially the way Christina looked at him, with hatred mixed with disgust.

If he had really done something unforgivable to her, he wouldn't have said a word. But he hadn't.

"I'm not marrying you willingly. Your whole family forced me. I don't even have my own freedom. Do you expect me to smile at someone who forced me?" Christina rolled her eyes at him.

His words made her feel nauseous.

"Even if you're mad at me for this, haven't I helped you before? Including today. If the bodyguard hadn't noticed something was wrong and brought you to the hospital, you'd still be lying in the mall bathroom!" William couldn't help but argue.

Did everything he had done mean nothing to Christina?

"So you did have someone following me. William, you're disgusting," Christina retorted sarcastically.

"I admit you've helped me a few times, but without you, my life would be at least 90% less troublesome!"

At least Jennifer wouldn't hate her so much, treating her as an enemy and making things difficult for her.

She wouldn't be forced to stay with the Cavendish family and could develop her own career, creating a better life through her own efforts.

"Christina!" William was so angry his head hurt.

He took a deep breath, telling himself repeatedly that Christina was still a patient and he shouldn't argue with a patient.

But it was so damn frustrating!

"When you went shopping today, did you notice anyone suspicious? Think about their appearance," William tried to suppress his anger.

Since it was a serious matter, Christina didn't continue to mock him.

She recalled the girl she met in the bathroom and described her appearance in detail, "There are cameras in the mall. She left shortly after I entered the bathroom. You should be able to find her through the footage."

"Don't be so naive next time. Before helping others, make sure you have the ability to do so," William couldn't help but lecture her.

Today's incident was too dangerous. He didn't want it to happen again.

Christina's mood, which had just calmed down a bit, was ruined again, "Can you stop lecturing me? I need to rest. Just leave."

Otherwise, she feared she might lose her temper and start another argument with him.

William knew her need for rest was just an excuse. She simply hated him.

But he didn't want to argue either, and catching the culprit was more important. Without saying more, he left.

The mall Christina visited was one of the Cavendish family's properties. William went there personally to check the surveillance footage.

The manager was very cooperative, "Mr. Cavendish, our mall's cameras are top-notch, high-definition. We can even capture a fly clearly."

Through the footage, William quickly identified the suspect and called the police. With the police's data tracking, they found out the person's identity.

She was a student at a nearby high school.

Since it was the weekend, William waited until Monday to go to the school with the police. With solid evidence and the police's stern tone, the girl broke down in tears.

She kept trying to shift the blame, "I was just following orders. I didn't know what was in the syringe. It could have been glucose or saline."

"You're in high school, not kindergarten. If it was glucose, why would they need you?" William exposed her lie.

He didn't hit women, especially not a high school student, but he wouldn't let this slide easily.

He questioned her sternly, "Who gave you the drug? I will get to the bottom of this. You better come clean."

"I really don't know. We only communicated online. The syringe was delivered to my house. I don't know who he is," the girl cried harder.

She was trying to avoid punishment.

William believed she wasn't lying, "You're an adult now. If you agreed to do something without knowing anything, I won't agree to a settlement."

The girl's parents initially wanted to pay him off, but upon learning his identity, they didn't dare mention it again.

With the police's investigation, they soon found an illegal loan platform and arrested everyone involved.

But William felt he was missing something.

These people had no grudge against Christina. Why would they target her? There must be more to this.

But he couldn't find anything immediately, so he left it to the police.

The girl's family, unwilling to see her life ruined, decided to plead with Christina directly.

At the hospital room door, they were unsurprisingly stopped by the bodyguards, "Someone is resting inside. Please leave."

"I know her. She'll let me in!" the girl protested.

Hearing the commotion, Christina opened the door, her tone cold, "Last time I trusted you, and I'm still in the hospital. Do you think I'll fall for it again?"

"But I know I was wrong."

"Get out." Christina showed no mercy.

When William arrived, he saw this scene. His eyes turned cold, and he called the bodyguards, "I told you to guard the door. Is this how you do it?"

The bodyguards quickly stepped forward and efficiently removed the family.

As William was about to enter the room, Christina shut the door in his face, "You leave with them."

"Christina! Open the door!" William was furious.

He knocked, but Christina wouldn't open. Since it was a hospital, he didn't want to make a scene.

In the end, he left.

Hearing his footsteps fade, Christina opened the door and watched his retreating figure, feeling a mix of emotions.

She wished they could stop seeing each other, but she knew it was impossible.

###chapter 119 Someone is Following Me

William was back again, his voice rough. "That Harper you mentioned last time..."

Christina shuddered, painful memories crashing over her like a tidal wave.

Harper. He had no right to bring up that name!

She couldn't hold back any longer, glaring at him with eyes full of hatred. William smirked, "What? Did I hit a nerve?"

Christina pressed her lips together, staying silent.

The ringing of a phone broke the tense silence between them. William answered, his expression growing serious. "Yeah, what is it?"

As he listened, his face became increasingly grave.

"Alright, I'll be back soon."

Christina watched him warily, still silent.

William sighed, a hint of sadness in his eyes. "You should rest. Don't worry about anything else. I'll take care of it."

With that, he turned and left.

Christina let out a quiet sigh of relief.

Not seeing him was the best thing.

But then Kelvin sent her a message, "The blueprints are due tomorrow."

"Got it."

She nearly pulled an all-nighter to finish the blueprints. When she delivered the draft, Kelvin stopped her.

"Why haven't you been at the office these past few days?"

"I had some personal stuff to deal with," Christina replied, not wanting to elaborate.

Kelvin nodded knowingly and pulled a file from his drawer, placing it on the desk. "This is for someone important in the industry. Deliver it and make a good impression."

Christina glanced at the file, understanding that Kelvin was trying to help her advance. She nodded in agreement.

"Sure, I'll deliver it."

The address was a hotel.

Probably here on a business trip, Christina signed the visitor log before heading up.

She knocked on the door, and an impatient voice came from inside. "Leave the room service at the door."

"I'm Kelvin's student, here to deliver some important documents. Could you please sign for them?" Christina said politely.

After a moment, the door opened.

The room was a mess, with blueprints scattered all over the floor.

Christina raised an eyebrow. "You..."

"Sorry, I don't like people in my room when I'm working on blueprints. Just give me the documents," said the man inside, who looked to be in his forties or fifties.

Christina forced a smile, understanding his quirks.

She handed over the documents and left the hotel.

It was rush hour, and she couldn't hail a cab. She decided to walk to a busier street.

Just as she turned, she saw Jennifer and a man sneaking out of the hotel. They seemed to be hiding something.

Jennifer was dressed very discreetly in a beige trench coat, a large hat, and sunglasses covering most of her face.

But even with the disguise, Christina recognized her.

Jennifer and the man seemed quite close.

Christina rubbed her eyes. "Am I seeing things?"

She decided to follow them.

Jennifer and the man didn't take a cab but walked, chatting and laughing.

The man occasionally leaned in to speak intimately with her. Their relationship was definitely not ordinary.

Christina suddenly remembered past events. Could it be that Jennifer had been with this man all along?

And William had no clue?

Driven by curiosity, she followed them.

Jennifer and the man went to a nearby mall. The man even picked out gifts for Jennifer, whispering to each other. Christina was too far to hear what they were saying.

She didn't dare get too close, just followed at a safe distance. Their behavior made it hard not to suspect something between them.

Jennifer put on a necklace, turning to the man with a smile. "How does it look?"

"Anything looks stunning on you," the man praised without hesitation.

Jennifer beamed, turning to the mirror for a closer look, but suddenly saw Christina standing not far away.

Jennifer's heart skipped a beat, and she quickly turned away.

Christina guessed that Jennifer had seen her through the mirror and pretended to take a phone call.

"Yes, I'm here."

"Okay, I'll be there soon."

Jennifer turned back, avoiding looking in Christina's direction.

The man noticed her unease. "What's wrong?"

Jennifer looked like she'd seen a ghost. "I think someone's following me."

"What!" The man frowned.

They glanced back, but Christina was no longer there.

Jennifer bit her lip. "She's always been against me. I need to teach her a lesson."

"Alright, I'll help you."

The man narrowed his eyes.

They thought they had time to plan, but unexpectedly ran into Christina on their way out.

Jennifer and the man exchanged a look.

A hand reached out to Christina, who was about to step down the stairs. She lost her balance and fell.

The stairs weren't high, but as she tumbled down, she felt like her bones were breaking, and stars danced before her eyes.

When she managed to get up, the stairs were empty.

Concerned bystanders gathered around.

"Miss, are you okay?"

Christina mustered the strength to say, "I'm fine."

"Do you need an ambulance?" a kind passerby asked.

"No, I'll be alright after a rest." Christina sat on a bench at the bottom of the stairs.

She rolled up her pants and sleeves, revealing bruises on her knees and elbows. Even a light touch was excruciating.

It had to be Jennifer!

She had felt someone push her.

But should she call the police?

She went to a pharmacy for some ointment and slowly made her way home.

Every inch of her body ached. She carefully applied the ointment and finally relaxed, slumping into a chair.

Her phone buzzed.

It was a message from Kaitlyn.

She called Kaitlyn right away. "What's up, Miss Fisher?"

Kaitlyn laughed. "You always tease me. Are you free tomorrow? Let's go shopping."

Christina pretended to be serious. "I'll have to check my schedule."

"Cut it out," Kaitlyn said, rolling her eyes. "It's settled!"

Christina, defeated by her straightforwardness, agreed. "Alright."

The next day, they met up.

Christina was still limping from her injuries. Kaitlyn noticed and asked in surprise, "What happened to you?"

Christina shrugged, trying to play it off. "Just a little accident. Nothing major."

Kaitlyn raised an eyebrow. "Doesn't look like 'nothing' to me. You sure you're okay?"

"Yeah, I'll be fine. Let's just enjoy our day," Christina insisted, not wanting to dwell on the incident.

Kaitlyn nodded, though she remained unconvinced. "Alright, but if you need to take a break, just let me know."

As they walked through the mall, Christina couldn't help but keep an eye out for Jennifer. She didn't want another surprise encounter.

Kaitlyn noticed her distraction. "You seem a bit on edge. Is something else going on?"

Christina hesitated, then decided to confide in her friend. "I saw Jennifer yesterday. She was with some guy, and they seemed pretty close. I think she might have pushed me down the stairs."

Kaitlyn's eyes widened. "Are you serious? That's crazy! You should definitely report it."

Christina sighed. "I know, but I don't have any proof. It's just my word against hers."

Kaitlyn frowned. "Still, you can't just let her get away with it. Maybe we can find a way to catch her in the act."

Christina nodded slowly. "Yeah, maybe. But for now, let's just focus on having a good time."

Kaitlyn smiled. "Deal. But if you need backup, I'm here for you."

Christina felt a surge of gratitude for her friend's support. "Thanks, Kaitlyn. I really appreciate it."

They continued their shopping trip, enjoying each other's company and trying to put the troubling events out of their minds, at least for a little while.

###chapter 120  Why Are You Here?

Christina waved her hand dismissively. "Don't even worry about it."

"What happened? Did someone mess with you?" Kaitlyn asked, clearly concerned.

Christina scratched her head, feeling a bit embarrassed. "It's actually kinda silly. I just tripped and fell, that's all."

"Are you okay? Maybe I shouldn't have asked you to come out," Kaitlyn said, her big, watery eyes filled with guilt.

"I'm fine. The doctor said it's nothing serious," Christina reassured her, shaking her head.

Kaitlyn, now cautious, decided against suggesting any thrilling activities. Instead, they wandered around a bit and then stopped at a café, ordering a few drinks. They sat down, sipping their beverages and chatting.

"Christina, have you ever had a crush on someone?" Kaitlyn asked suddenly.

Christina was taken aback.

A crush? If she counted her past life, then maybe William.

But she shook her head. "Nope."

"Someone as amazing as you will definitely attract some great guys in the future," Kaitlyn said, pouting.

Christina chuckled. "You're so young, and already so sentimental?"

Kaitlyn sighed deeply. "I used to think I could have anything I wanted, but now I've learned the hard way that the world doesn't revolve around me."

Love really does make people grow up.

Christina took a sip of her drink, then looked up to see Kaitlyn's face turning red, with visible hives appearing on her skin.

"What's wrong with your face?"

Kaitlyn touched her cheek and suddenly felt her lips tingling.

"I..."

She belatedly picked up her drink. "What's in this?"

A staff member quickly came over to explain. "Prune juice, mango, apple..."

"Oh no, I'm allergic to mango," Kaitlyn said, gasping for breath.

Allergies can cause throat swelling and difficulty breathing. Christina didn't hesitate and rushed her to the hospital.

Kaitlyn's condition was serious, and she was taken straight to the emergency room.

A doctor came out to ask, "Does the patient have any other known allergies?"

Christina was unsure. "I don't know, but she's always had health issues and has been hospitalized frequently due to a weak immune system."

"Got it," the doctor nodded and went back into the emergency room.

Kaitlyn was still in critical condition.

Christina ran around, handling the hospital admission procedures.

She didn't expect to run into Stanley.

He had been busy with other projects lately, and after his previous confession, things had been awkward between them. Even when they saw each other at the architecture institute, they didn't greet each other.

But now, they couldn't pretend to be strangers. Stanley approached her first.

"Are you sick?"

"No, it's Kaitlyn," Christina replied honestly.

Stanley nodded in understanding. "I see."

"She had an allergic reaction, and it's pretty serious," Christina explained, though she didn't want to comment on their relationship. Kaitlyn would probably want to see him when she woke up.

Stanley's eyes deepened. "Should I go see her?"

"Do what you feel is right. I'm not going to force you," Christina said calmly.

After a moment of thought, Stanley decided to visit Kaitlyn.

Kaitlyn had been moved to a regular room after stabilizing. She was still on an IV, and the redness and swelling on her face hadn't subsided, making her look quite pitiful.

They sat in silence for a while until Kaitlyn woke up. The first thing she saw was Christina.

"A glass of juice almost killed me."

"How are you feeling? Should I call the doctor?" Christina asked quickly.

Kaitlyn shook her head. "I'm fine."

She glanced around and noticed Stanley sitting quietly nearby. For a moment, she thought she was seeing things. After a closer look, she screamed in surprise.

"What are you doing here?"

She suddenly remembered that her face was swollen and covered in hives, and quickly covered it with the bedsheet.

"Christina, why didn't you tell me he was here?"

"You were unconscious," Christina said helplessly.

"And who asked you to call him?" Kaitlyn felt she couldn't face anyone, especially not her crush.

"It wasn't Christina who called me. I happened to be at the hospital and ran into her. That's how I found out you were admitted," Stanley explained calmly.

"Thanks for coming to see me. You can leave now," Kaitlyn said, preferring not to have him see her in such a state.

Christina sighed. "Maybe you should go?"

Stanley didn't agree. Instead, he awkwardly said, "Do you want something to eat? I'll get it for you. As your friend, it's my duty to take care of you. No need to be polite."

"Who asked you to be my friend?" Kaitlyn muttered under her breath.

Stanley was momentarily stunned.

Kaitlyn realized her words sounded ambiguous. "Forget it, I was just talking nonsense. Don't overthink it."

Seeing the awkward atmosphere between them, Christina felt like a third wheel.

She checked her phone. "Oh, I forgot I have a design draft to finish. Kaitlyn, I'll come visit you in a couple of days, okay?"

Kaitlyn peeked out from under the covers. "You'll come back, right?"

"Of course," Christina promised, and Kaitlyn finally agreed.

After Christina left, Kaitlyn realized her face was still swollen and quickly hid under the covers again.

Stanley couldn't help but laugh. "I've already seen it. You don't look ugly, just a bit cute."

"Really?" Kaitlyn peeked out with just her eyes showing.

Stanley nodded. "Really. When have I ever lied?"

Kaitlyn felt reassured. "Then stay with me."

Stanley hesitated but couldn't refuse her, so he agreed.

When Christina got home, she found a bouquet of flowers waiting for her. The note said it was to celebrate her landing a big project. She wasn't sure who sent it, but decided to keep the flowers and put them in a vase.

The next day, William's car was parked outside her building. When she came down, he rolled down the window.

"Get in."

"The deal is done. We don't need to see each other anymore. It might cause misunderstandings," Christina said coldly.

William looked at her thoughtfully, then smiled. "You accepted the flowers. Doesn't that mean we're good now?"

###chapter 121  Will You Believe It?

"Wait, you sent those flowers?" Christina's voice was a mix of surprise and disbelief.

William had never done anything like this before, not in this life or the last. This was the first bouquet he had ever given her.

Instead of feeling touched, she let out a mocking laugh. "You think a bunch of flowers can make up for all the crap you've put me through?"

"What do you want, then?" William's eyes narrowed, but he didn't seem angry.

"I just want you to stay away from me." Christina shot him a cold glance before turning and walking away quickly.

Seeing this, William got into his car and followed her.

"Christina! You took those flowers because you thought they were from someone else, didn't you?"

Christina paused for a moment. "So what? If I had known they were from you, I would've never taken them."

William stopped in front of her, taking two steps at a time to block her path.

Christina looked at him warily. She was afraid of going through that kind of pain again.

William reached out to grab her arm but accidentally caught her elbow instead. Though it had been two days, and walking wasn't too painful, his sudden grip made her gasp in pain.

William noticed something was wrong and pulled her hand closer. "What's wrong? Where are you hurt?"

Christina felt his sudden concern was like a ticking time bomb, ready to explode at any moment. She tried to pull her hand back forcefully, but she wasn't strong enough.

He rolled up her sleeve and saw the bruise, his expression turning serious. "What happened? How did you get this bruise?"

Christina saw the worry on his face and a thought suddenly crossed her mind.

"If I said Jennifer did this, would you believe me?"

She found herself hoping, just a little, that he wouldn't blindly trust Jennifer again.

But to her disappointment, William's face changed immediately. "Christina, stop with the nonsense."

Christina knew then that Jennifer would always be his favorite. He might use her as a distraction in his life, but she would never surpass Jennifer's place in his heart.

She wouldn't be foolish anymore. She smiled faintly. "Just kidding. I fell by accident. If there's nothing else, I need to get back to the architecture firm."

"I have a project. If you have time, we should discuss it." William stood firmly in her way.

Christina maintained her distant demeanor. "Sorry, the firm has a policy that architects can't take on private work. If you need me, go through the firm. But I have a lot of projects right now, so even if you do, I probably won't have time."

William could hear the rejection in her words and see the genuine distance in her expression. It wasn't an act.

While he was lost in thought, Christina had already walked away quickly.

When she got to the office, she couldn't understand why William was doing this. Was he bored and using her for amusement? But this time, she wouldn't let him control her.

Bruce came over and knocked on her desk. "What are you daydreaming about?"

Christina glanced at him. "Didn't know you were the office monitor now."

"Who cares about you? Kelvin said the client wasn't happy with the last design," Bruce said coldly. "I see you have a lot of projects. Why not give me a couple? I can help you out."

Help? He just wanted to take her projects because he was jealous.

Christina sneered, resting her head on her hand as she looked at Bruce. "Why pretend to be so noble? You mocked me for not being able to handle a project, and now you want my work. It's baffling."

Bruce's face turned red. "If you don't want to, fine. I was just trying to help. If you think you can handle it all, suit yourself."

He turned and left, clearly annoyed.

Christina watched him go and smiled faintly.

After work, as she was about to leave the firm, a luxury car pulled up nearby. The driver waved at her.

"Christina."

She looked up and saw it was Walter.

"Walter." She walked over quickly. "What brings you here?"

Walter opened the car door. "Get in first."

Christina nodded slightly and got in, closing the door behind her. "Walter, is there something you need?"

"Can't I just come to see you? Let's go get dinner." Walter smiled and started the car, heading towards downtown.

He chose a nice restaurant with a good reputation. Once they were seated, the waiter brought the menu.

Christina felt relaxed for once and ordered a few dishes with a smile. "Just tell me what you need. You don't have to bribe me. If I can help, I will."

"Well, someone invited me to an event abroad, but I need to bring a date. I don't have anyone else, so I thought of you." Walter looked a bit embarrassed.

"Oh, I see." Christina felt a bit troubled.

After thinking for a while, she asked, "Is it an important event? Do you really need a date?"

"Yes." Walter nodded. "You know, besides you, I can't think of anyone else."

Christina agreed reluctantly. "Alright, how many days will it be?"

"Three to four days, maybe a week at most." Walter smiled as he looked at the menu.

Christina calculated the time. She should be able to manage it, and she could work during the trip if needed. So she agreed.

The food arrived quickly. Walter cut a piece of steak and placed it on Christina's plate. "Try it. How does it taste?"

Christina took a bite and was pleasantly surprised. Her eyes lit up. "You have great taste. This restaurant is excellent."

"Even if you're flattering me, I appreciate it." Walter laughed and continued to place more steak on her plate. "Eat as much as you like."

Their intimate interaction caught the eye of William, who had just walked in. He raised a cold eyebrow and stared at them.

Christina shared her food with Walter and asked with a smile, "So, when do we leave?"

###chapter 122 How About You Take Me Along

Walter glanced at his phone's calendar and said, "Day after tomorrow. Tickets are booked. Just be ready."

"Sure, no problem," Christina nodded.

"It's pretty far north, so it might be cold. Pack some warm clothes," Walter added thoughtfully.

Christina nodded, making a mental note.

As she was about to eat, she suddenly saw William.

Thinking about his recent pestering, Christina felt a wave of anxiety. But to her surprise, he ignored her and went straight to a private room upstairs.

Walter didn't notice and asked, "What are you looking at?"

Christina shook her head and forced a smile, "Nothing."

William, sitting on the second floor, watched them for a long time before calling Bob.

"Check what Walter's been up to lately."

After Christina went back and started preparing, Kaitlyn found out and was reluctant to see her go.

"Why don't you take me with you?"

Christina sighed, "I'm going for work, not for fun. I'll bring you a gift when I get back."

"Alright," Kaitlyn pouted.

"And you and Stanley..." Christina raised an eyebrow. Since she left the hospital that day, there had been some interaction between them.

Kaitlyn sighed, "Don't tease me. He's just a clueless idiot."

"Okay, just let it be," Christina shrugged.

Walter had everything prepared.

He arranged a car to take her to the airport, using the VIP lane, so there was no need to queue. She only saw him again in first class.

Walter kindly placed a blanket over her legs, "It might get a bit cold."

"Thanks," Christina smiled.

After nearly seven hours, they finally reached their destination. As soon as they got off the plane, a cold wind hit them like a knife.

Walter draped his coat over her shoulders, his face full of tenderness, "I told you, it's colder here. You should've dressed warmer."

"I didn't expect it to be this cold," Christina exhaled, her breath turning into a cloud of mist in the cold air.

They took a car to the hotel, which had a classic European decor, resembling a castle.

Christina had her luggage sent to her room and went to the hotel restaurant with Walter.

"What's the plan for tomorrow?"

After ordering, Walter said, "We're attending the banquet we were invited to. You'll need to dress up."

"No problem, I'll follow your lead," Christina smiled and nodded.

On their way back after dinner, Christina felt like someone was watching her. She turned around and saw a pale face flash at the end of the hallway, making her scream.

Walter quickly asked, "What's wrong?"

Christina hesitated, "I think someone was spying on me."

"Really? Maybe you were mistaken?" Walter turned around. The hallway was empty, with an old-fashioned decor that felt both ancient and mysterious.

The dim lighting added to the eerie atmosphere.

Christina sighed, "It's nothing. I must've been mistaken. Let's go rest. That seven-hour flight was exhausting."

"How about we share a room?" Walter suggested, concerned.

"No way," Christina laughed, "People might get the wrong idea, and then I'd be blamed for ruining your chances of getting married."

Walter wanted to say more, but Christina quickly walked to her room, leaving him to follow.

The next morning, as sunlight streamed in, the hotel's mysterious aura seemed to lift, replaced by warmth.

There were only a few guests, scattered around.

Christina dressed up, wearing a black velvet gown that accentuated her figure, with a white mink shawl over her shoulders. Her flawless skin glowed, making her look even more stunning.

Walter's face lit up with admiration when he saw her.

"You look beautiful."

Christina smiled, "Thank you."

They arrived at the banquet. When the doors opened, all eyes turned to them.

Christina heard someone behind her say, "Look at her, golden hair, blue eyes. She's as beautiful as a doll."

She confidently waved and smiled at the crowd.

Walter greeted the host and then whispered to Christina, "Everyone's looking at you. You're like the star of the night."

"Stop teasing me," Christina blushed.

Walter chuckled, "I feel like I've got every man's envy tonight."

"Well, I've got every woman's jealousy," Christina replied casually.

A sudden voice interrupted their banter.

"He's right. Every man here envies him. That velvet dress suits you perfectly, though you look adorable even without it."

They turned to see a man in a tuxedo, holding a glass of champagne. His pale face and somber demeanor gave him an eerie elegance.

Christina was surprised, "You understand what we're saying?"

He smiled, "My great-grandfather fled here during the war. Though he married a local woman, he never forgot to teach us his native language."

"I see. Nice to meet you," Christina greeted.

"Welcome. I toast to your journey," the man raised his glass, his eyes fixed on Christina.

Christina felt uneasy, his gaze like a snake's, making her uncomfortable.

She smiled politely, "I toast to you too."

"I'm Matthew Moore," he introduced himself.

Despite her discomfort, Christina smiled, "I'm Christina Windsor, and this is my companion, Walter Cavendish."

"Pleasure to meet you. Enjoy the party," Matthew's eyes lingered on them before he smiled.

Just then, the host came to find him.

###chapter 123  Is It Because of Me?

The two exchanged a few whispered words before Matthew turned back and said, "Excuse me."

Walter frowned. "I don't like the vibe I'm getting from that guy."

"Me neither," Christina said, trying to ignore the queasy feeling in her stomach. "But we're only here for a few days."

"Better safe than sorry," Walter said, standing protectively by her side, his eyes serious.

Christina nodded in agreement.

After their brief conversation, elegant music began to play, and guests started inviting their partners to dance.

As they danced, Christina couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching her.

She glanced back and saw Matthew on the balcony, holding a glass of champagne, staring at her with a disturbingly obsessive look.

When Matthew noticed her gaze, he simply raised his glass in a mock toast.

Feeling increasingly uncomfortable, Christina turned to Walter and said, "I'm tired. Can we leave?"

Walter nodded. "Sure, I'll let the host know. We can visit him in a couple of days."

Relieved, Christina and Walter made their excuses, saying they weren't feeling well and needed to rest at the hotel.

The host, a cheerful and understanding person, said, "Of course, you shouldn't stay if you're not feeling well. We'll catch up another time."

Walter smiled. "Sorry about this. We'll definitely visit soon."

"I'll be waiting," the host said, personally seeing them out.

By the time they returned to the hotel, it was dark. Walter checked his phone. "There are a few local restaurants nearby with great food. How about we change and go there for dinner?"

Christina nodded. "Sounds good. I barely ate anything at the party."

After changing out of her dress and hanging it in the closet, Christina joined Walter.

The colorful lights on Main Street made it as bright as day. The local cuisine, though not entirely to their taste, was a unique experience.

As Walter ate slowly, he said, "After we visit them tomorrow, let's catch a late flight out."

"Is it because of me?" Christina asked, feeling guilty. She didn't want to disrupt his plans.

"Not entirely. It's too cold here," Walter said with a light laugh. "Besides, we don't know anyone here. Staying longer wouldn't be much fun."

Christina knew he was considering her feelings and appreciated his kindness.

She sighed softly. "Thank you."

"Why are you always so polite with me?" Walter suddenly reached out.

Christina looked up, and they both froze. Walter awkwardly grabbed a napkin and wiped the sauce from her mouth.

"You had some sauce there."

Flustered, Christina took the napkin. "I can do it myself."

Walter took a deep breath, as if steeling himself for something.

But after a long pause, he still didn't say anything.

Curious, Christina asked, "What is it? Just say it."

Walter hesitated, then shook his head and offered her some meat from his plate. "Nothing. Just eat more."

The lighting was perfect, the atmosphere intimate. They enjoyed the moment.

After exploring the area a bit, they returned to the hotel.

At her room door, Walter suddenly said, "Hope I see you in your dreams."

Before Christina could respond, Walter had already entered his room.

She pondered his words, thinking he was just wishing her a good night, and didn't dwell on it.

Back in her room, she noticed something odd while changing. Her dress, which she had hung facing left, was now facing the other way.

She called the front desk. "Did someone enter my room while I was out?"

"No, ma'am. Housekeeping isn't scheduled for the evening," the receptionist replied confidently.

But then she heard muffled voices, as if someone was covering the phone and talking.

Impatient, Christina asked, "Is this a difficult question?"

The receptionist quickly returned. "Sorry, ma'am. We checked with housekeeping. There was a temporary cleaning tonight due to a shift change. We apologize for any inconvenience and will file a complaint if needed."

Christina, not one to hold a grudge, said, "No need. I just wanted to confirm."

After hanging up, she got ready for bed.

The wind howled outside, but the fireplace kept the room warm. The hotel, resembling an old castle, had a timeless charm.

She drifted into a restless sleep, dreaming of running through a dark forest, chased by a beast with piercing eyes.

Meanwhile, her door slowly opened.

A tall figure crept in, moving silently to her bedside, staring at her with a twisted fascination. "You're so beautiful," he whispered.

He lifted the blanket, grabbed her wrist, and inhaled her scent deeply. "You smell like roses."

His kiss on her hand felt like a slimy toad, making her shiver. The wind blew through a crack in the window, sending a chill through her.

She woke with a start, realizing it was just a dream. But as she tried to fall back asleep, she saw a shadowy figure.

Terrified, she sat up. "What are you doing here?"

She hadn't noticed anyone entering her room.

The figure stepped closer, and in the moonlight, she saw his pale face and deep eyes, like a vampire.

It was Matthew.

###chapter 124 Fortunately, She Dodged Quickly

"What the hell do you think you're doing?" Christina demanded, her voice icy.

"You're my muse. From the moment I first saw you, I was hooked," Matthew said, stepping closer, his eyes gleaming with a creepy obsession.

Christina felt nothing but disgust and fear.

Matthew was a total psycho, sneaking into her room in the middle of the night.

"Get out, or I'm calling the cops."

"You're meant to be my goddess," Matthew said, taking another step forward, his face twisted and terrifying like a demon.

Christina's hand fumbled beside her.

She remembered there were some decorative items on the nightstand.

But Matthew noticed her intention and grabbed her hands, pinning her to the bed, his tongue flicking out to lick her.

Thankfully, she dodged just in time.

But she was trapped, unable to move.

"What do you want?" Christina was nearly breathless with fear.

Matthew caressed her face with one hand, his eyes filled with a twisted obsession. "Stay here with me in this castle. I'm the Duke, and you'll be my Duchess."

This guy was a complete lunatic.

He looked frail, but his strength was overwhelming. She couldn't break free at all!

Suddenly, Matthew lunged at her.

Christina didn't give up. She kicked him hard in the groin, and Matthew's face twisted in pain as he stumbled back and fell off the bed.

She seized the opportunity and bolted for the door.

Matthew, like a crazed beast, lunged and grabbed her. "Where do you think you're going?"

Christina struggled and screamed, "Let go of me, you psycho!"

"I am a psycho. Do you know how much my heart raced when I first saw you? You walked down that hallway like my queen, finally crossing mountains and seas to find me."

Matthew's crazed ranting, combined with his grotesque expression in the dark, was terrifying.

Christina defended herself, grabbing anything she could find and throwing it at him.

She reached the door and was about to open it when she heard the lock click. But Matthew caught up, grabbing her slender ankle and dragging her to the floor.

Matthew pounced on her.

Christina kicked him again, but this time Matthew was ready. He grabbed her ankle and laughed.

"The same trick won't work twice. That kick really hurt. You owe me for that."

Christina almost vomited.

Just then, the door burst open, and Walter appeared, turning on the light.

"What the hell are you doing?" Walter demanded.

Matthew's expression changed when he saw Walter.

"What's your relationship with her?"

"You sick freak, I'll kill you!" Walter charged at him, forcing Matthew to dodge in panic.

Matthew was no match for him. He ran to the door, pointing angrily. "You'll regret this!"

Walter wanted to chase him down and beat him senseless.

But Matthew disappeared behind a wall, and when Walter reached it, the stone seams closed. He couldn't find the mechanism to open it.

Christina caught up. "Don't chase him."

"That psycho seems to have some connection to this hotel. We should leave now." Walter recalled the terrifying scene.

Luckily, he had been a light sleeper and heard the commotion next door, or the consequences would have been unimaginable!

Christina nodded, still trembling with fear. "He has a key to my room. We need to leave immediately."

Walter agreed.

"I'll pack our things!"

"Okay." Christina quickly returned to her room.

Matthew stumbled into the top-floor conference room.

"What happened to you? Why do you look so disheveled?"

A woman sat behind a large desk, exhaling cigar smoke. Her red lips were particularly striking.

"Sis, you have to help me. Someone attacked me."

"What? Someone dared to do that on our turf?" The woman slammed the desk, her eyes flashing with anger.

"Sis! Hurry, or they'll get away." Matthew gritted his teeth. "We can't let them leave the hotel."

"Alright." The woman stubbed out her cigar.

Christina and Walter got into the elevator after packing.

The elevator descended for a while before malfunctioning, plummeting rapidly.

Christina was terrified, pressing all the buttons. Walter held her tightly. "It's okay, I'm here."

The elevator suddenly shot back up.

It stopped at a floor, the display showing gibberish, and the doors opened to darkness.

Moonlight streamed through a skylight, casting eerie shadows.

They exchanged glances.

Walter cleared his throat. "Let's find another way out."

Christina nodded. "Okay!"

They quickly exited. This was a floor they had never been to, with a large platform offering a view outside, but it was too high to escape from.

They found a staircase and were about to go down when Christina was yanked back, falling to the ground. A wall appeared, separating them.

Walter realized there was no way back, only a wall.

He pounded on it in frustration. "What do you want?"

Silence.

Christina was dragged into a large office and tied to the wall.

A woman, barely visible in the dark, stood out with her red lips.

"Do you know what happens to those who mess with the Moore Family? You're not leaving."

"The Moore Family?" Christina repeated, realizing something. "It was Matthew. He snuck into my room!"

Before she could finish, a whip cracked down.

"Silence!"

###chapter 125 You Are Truly a Madman

Christina's eyes filled with tears from the pain, staring in disbelief at the woman in front of her.

The woman scoffed, "How many lives do you think you have, talking about him like that? So what? This whole castle is ours."

This whole family is nuts!

Christina bit her lip hard. "What do you want?"

"Whatever it takes." The woman snapped her fingers. "My brother got hurt pretty bad. You're gonna pay for that."

The whip came down again, and Christina couldn't hold back her screams. "Aren't you afraid the cops will come after you?"

"The cops? Out here in the middle of nowhere, people go missing all the time." The woman laughed. "Once we've taught you a lesson and made you more obedient, you'll have your place."

Despair filled Christina's heart. She never imagined that staying at a hotel could lead her to a pair of psychopaths.

As the lashes continued, she became numb, like a walking corpse enduring the torment.

Outside, Walter was losing his mind.

He pounded on the stone wall, desperately searching for a way in, but he couldn't find one.

A bodyguard handed the woman a surveillance tape.

She watched Walter's frantic efforts, biting her lip lightly. "David, isn't he hot? Grandpa always wanted to go back, but even if we can't, having a man like him by my side wouldn't be so bad."

"What do you want to do?" David asked.

"Bring him to me." The woman licked her red lips, her eyes filled with undisguised desire.

Walter was brought to the office.

He saw the woman sitting behind the desk and demanded, "Where's Christina?"

"A single man sees a woman and asks about another woman. How disappointing." The woman stood up, placing her hand on Walter's shoulder, and exhaled a puff of smoke into his face.

Walter turned his head away in disgust. "What do you want?"

The woman chuckled. "Before I saw you, I wanted to kill that woman to show her that the Moore Family isn't to be messed with. But after seeing you, I changed my mind."

"What do you want?" Walter asked coldly.

"I want you to be with me."

"You're delusional!" Walter's face turned icy as he grabbed her by the throat. "Tell your men to release Christina."

"Wonderful." The woman clapped her hands, laughing maniacally. "Dying at the hands of the man I fell for at first sight is the best end for me. Don't worry, after I die, they'll kill you and put you in my coffin. As for that woman, she might be left to rot in the wilderness, or my brother might keep her as a pet."

"You're insane." Walter spat.

"Thank you for the compliment. I've always aspired to be a madwoman!" The woman laughed heartily.

Walter knew she wasn't bluffing. He couldn't risk Christina's life.

"What do you want?"

"Stay with me, be the man of my hotel, and I'll grant you one condition." The woman leaned on his shoulder.

Walter hesitated, then heard Christina's screams from behind the stone wall.

The woman clapped her hands. "Perfect timing. You hear that? She's being tortured. Make your decision quickly, or she'll die, and we won't have a deal."

The screams were filled with terror. Walter couldn't bear to let Christina suffer.

"Fine, I agree."

"Really?" The woman twirled her curly hair, laughing. "Seems like that woman means a lot to you."

Her tone carried a hint of threat.

"What do you want?" Walter turned back. "I brought her here. I have to ensure her safety. As for the rest, there's nothing to discuss."

The woman didn't push further, smiling as she snapped her fingers. "David, tell them to stop."

Christina's screams finally ceased, and Walter breathed a sigh of relief, eager to check on her.

The woman suddenly stopped him. "Wait."

Walter frowned. "I've agreed. What more do you want? Both of us are in your hands. Are you backing out?"

"I never go back on my word. I know your name, Walter Cavendish. Remember mine, Rhea Moore. I'm your wife now."

Rhea's demeanor softened, her hands folded gently in front of her.

"I'll remember." Walter gritted his teeth, rushing into the room.

Christina weakly lifted her head. "Why are you still here?"

"I couldn't leave without finding you." Walter quickly untied her.

Christina, drained of strength, collapsed to the floor. "Can we leave now?"

"Yes, we can." Walter nodded.

"Then let's go." Christina took a deep breath. This place was a nightmare, and she wanted out.

"Alright." Walter picked her up.

At the door, Rhea blocked their way. "Where do you think you're going?"

"I'm taking her out of here."

"Do you think I'm stupid?" Rhea laughed softly. "She can leave, but you can't."

"What?" Christina couldn't believe her ears. "You two are getting married?"

"Yes, we are." Walter confirmed.

"You're doing this to save me?" Christina guessed immediately. "No, you can't."

"There's no time to argue. I need medicine." Walter said coldly. "I'll treat her wounds and make sure she's safe. I need to see her out myself."

Rhea looked indifferent. "It's just some superficial wounds. Once she's healed enough to leave on her own, she can go. Honestly, I want your friends and family to witness our wedding."

"What? Wedding?" Christina was in shock. How could they be talking about marriage after she was just tortured?

"Yes, we're getting married." Walter admitted.

"You're doing this for me?" Christina asked.

"Let's not discuss this now. I need medicine." Walter insisted. "I'll treat her and ensure she's safe. Then I'll come back."

Rhea didn't argue, smiling as she snapped her fingers. "David, get the medicine."

Christina's screams finally stopped, and Walter breathed a sigh of relief, eager to check on her.

###chapter 126 Do You Know Who You Have Provoked?

Rhea agreed, twirling a strand of her hair shyly. "Okay."

She turned and left to give instructions to her confidant.

Christina stared at him in disbelief. "You want to marry her? They're nuts! I won't let you make such a sacrifice for me."

"Do you expect me to just watch you die?" Walter said in a low voice. "I brought you out here."

"You can call the cops. I can't watch you sacrifice yourself for me. You need to leave. I was the one who pissed off Matthew. That psycho wants to torture me. I can't let you take the fall for me."

Christina's face was resolute.

"What do you mean, take the fall for you? Do you know how painful it is to watch the woman I love suffer and be powerless to help?" Walter suddenly shouted.

The woman he loves?

Christina's eyes widened in disbelief, staring at his expression.

Walter couldn't hold back anymore. "Yes, you're the woman I love. How could I stand by and do nothing while you suffer? Christina, the Moore Family are the local tyrants. The local authorities are a mess. If they're doing this, it means they have protection from higher up. Don't try to do anything for me. Get a ticket and go back home as soon as possible."

"What are you saying? You just confessed to me and now you want me to abandon you? Walter, do you think I'm that cold-hearted?" Christina bit her lip, her eyes fixed on him.

"Of course not, but I wish you were." Walter knew exactly what kind of person Christina was, but at this moment, he didn't want her to take any more risks.

Christina shook her head. "I can't do it!"

"You have to, Christina. She won't hurt me." Walter's eyes were full of determination, not giving an inch.

Just as Christina was about to say something, Rhea returned, leaning against the doorframe, her eyes glinting with amusement.

"Enough, stop flirting with my fiancé. Otherwise, I might not let you leave and make you watch us make love."

Christina opened her mouth to curse, but Walter covered it.

"That's enough. Get out of here. I don't need you meddling."

Rhea just watched them, smiling silently.

After Christina had treated her wounds and regained some strength, Rhea had her bodyguards throw her belongings at her.

"Take them back. And if you could deliver some good news to his family, that would be even better."

Christina bit her lip. "Do you know who you're messing with?"

Rhea threatened viciously, "I don't care about other places, but here, the Moore Family is the biggest. We've stood strong for a hundred years for a reason. I advise you not to go against us, or you won't know where you'll end up."

The hotel's doors slowly closed in front of Christina.

The cold wind was biting. She rubbed her shoulders and found a place to stay.

As Rhea turned to leave, Matthew appeared, staring at her like a ghost. "Where did you take my muse? Didn't you say you'd send her to me once you were done with her?"

Rhea patted his shoulder. "Bro, I don't fall for people often. Let me have her first."

Matthew stomped his foot in anger. "No way, I want her. She's the only one I want."

"Relax. I'll find you an even better muse, someone who'll be all yours." Rhea laughed heartily.

Christina tried everything she could think of, but nothing worked.

She thought of William. With his influence, and considering the Cavendish family was involved, he wouldn't ignore this.

She pondered for a moment and made the call.

At that moment, William was asleep in a hotel.

He had a dream.

In the dream, he was living a completely different life.

The people around him were familiar, but it was like they were in different roles. His life seemed to have a turning point. He dreamed that after that night, he married Christina under public pressure.

After the wedding, every meeting was filled with animosity. Not long after, Christina found out she was pregnant. Ten months later, she gave birth to a baby girl.

From a god-like perspective, he clearly saw the sunlight streaming into the hospital room. Christina held the baby gently and said, "Let's name her Harper. I hope her life is sweet and smooth."

The scene shifted. A boy walked up to him, holding his hand, calling him Dad.

"What? Who are you? I have a daughter, not a son." William looked at the boy in shock.

Jennifer came up to him. "Are you crazy? This is our son, Mike. When did he become a girl?"

"Daddy, hold me." Mike reached out his small hands.

William, confused, picked up the soft, cuddly child.

"Harper?"

He called softly.

Jennifer's face changed. "William, how can you mention Christina's daughter in front of our son? It's because of her that Mike can't return to the family."

William shook his head. "It's nothing."

He felt a bit disoriented.

This life was completely unfamiliar, yet it felt so real, as if it had actually happened.

A ringing phone woke him.

He sat up abruptly, still muttering, "Harper."

He remembered Christina mentioning that name. In the dream, Harper was their daughter. Why would he dream of that name?

Could it be that he was dreaming about what he thought about during the day because of Christina?

The phone rang again. He saw it was Christina calling. He didn't answer the first time, but she persistently called again.

He took a deep breath, answered the call, and cleared his throat. "What is it?"

When Christina heard his voice, she felt a glimmer of hope. "I need your help with something."

"You need my help?" William laughed coldly. "That's rare. What is it?"

"Walter and I are on a business trip. We offended the local tyrants, the Moore Family. One of their women has taken a liking to Walter and wants to marry him. I thought about it, and you're the only one who can help."

Christina briefly explained the situation.

"You want my help for this?" William sneered, looking at the cold night sky. "In the middle of the night, you really know how to ask for favors."

###chapter 127  It's More Interesting to Say It in Person

Christina bit her lip, trying to hold back her frustration. "Walter's in trouble because of me. Please, help me. I'm begging you!"

William's voice was calm but firm. "Some things are better discussed face-to-face."

"You mean..." Christina hesitated.

"I'm here. I'll give you an address. Come find me." William's tone was flat, yet it carried an undeniable command.

She bit her lip again.

Even though she didn't want any more contact with William, she knew that if she didn't go, Walter would be left without any help.

After getting the address, she headed straight to the hotel. The grand lobby was brightly lit, and despite the cold night, she felt a slight warmth.

She took the elevator up, knocked on the door, and it opened to a dark room. William stood at the entrance, his eyes like a predator ready to pounce.

"What are you doing here?" Christina asked, though she had a pretty good idea it had something to do with her.

"Business trip, vacation," William replied nonchalantly.

Christina didn't dwell on it. "Since you're here, can you help me save Walter? He got into trouble with the local thugs, the Moore Family. I hope you can think of something."

"What do I get in return?" William propped his head on his hand, looking at her with interest.

"What do you want?" Christina asked, her eyes fixed on him.

Out of nowhere, William mentioned, "I had a dream. Tell me, was it real or not?"

Christina was taken aback by his question and laughed lightly. "A dream? Of course, it's not real. What's there to talk about?"

William bit his lip. "I dreamed about Harper."

Christina froze, her eyes filled with uncontrollable hatred.

"You have no right to mention her."

"Why do you get so worked up every time I mention her? Tell me the truth," William demanded, his eyes locked on hers.

The hatred in her eyes was so intense it was almost palpable, as if she wanted to kill him.

Christina let out a cold laugh. "The truth? You just had a dream. What truth could there be?"

William looked puzzled. "Then why do you look like you want to kill me over a dream? It's just a dream!"

"To you, it's just a dream. To me, it's a nightmare I never want to relive!" Christina shouted, on the verge of breaking down.

William was stunned. "What do you mean?"

"That was my life. From the moment Harper was born, you never loved her. After she died, you even took her heart to save your precious son, Mike. How could you be so heartless? I wish I could kill you!"

Christina felt a strange sense of relief after finally voicing the secret she had kept for so long.

William saw the deep hatred in her eyes and felt a numb pain in his heart.

He pulled out a decorative dagger, his voice choked. "If you want to kill me so badly, go ahead. See if you can do it."

At that moment, William wondered if she could really go through with it.

Christina, consumed by hatred, took the dagger and thrust it toward his heart.

The decorative dagger didn't go in deep before hitting resistance. William clutched his chest, stepping back in disbelief. "You really want me dead?"

"Yes, I want you dead," Christina's eyes were bloodshot.

She wanted to drag William to hell to apologize to Harper.

William half-knelt on the ground, a bitter smile on his lips. "In this life, I've never done such a thing. Do you think it's fair?"

"It's only because my rebirth changed everything. If things had gone the same as before, you would have killed our daughter. You're a cruel, heartless man."

Christina lunged at him with the dagger.

William pushed her away, coughing heavily. "Christina, don't you want to save Walter?"

Hearing Walter's name, she froze. She could die, but she couldn't abandon Walter.

William sensed her hesitation, got up, and walked to her side, grabbing her neck. "Then do as I say, or there will be one more person in hell."

Christina stood still.

"What do you want?"

"Come back to the States with me," William said, barely able to stand.

"If I go back with you, will you save him?" Christina bit her lip, the hatred in her eyes still deep.

William's face showed a broken smile, made more tragic by the blood. "But if you don't come back with me, I definitely won't save him."

"Is this fun for you, William?" Christina looked up at him.

William's consciousness was fading. "Even if we're entangled in hatred for a lifetime, I don't want you to leave me."

"You're a complete scoundrel," Christina said, wishing she could kill him and tear him apart.

"Then so be it." William pulled out his phone. "Bob, come to my room."

A minute after the call, Bob arrived and was shocked by the scene. "What happened? Who did this?"

William used his last bit of strength. "I need a ticket back to the States for tomorrow, and get one for Christina too. Whether she goes or not is up to her."

"I'll take you to the hospital," Bob said, supporting him.

"Do as I say," William managed to say before passing out.

"Okay, Mr. Cavendish, don't worry." Bob nodded, then glanced at Christina. The room was empty except for them, and Christina's face was full of hatred. Did she stab him?

But he couldn't worry about that now and quickly took William to the hospital.

After the doctor finished the examination and stitched the wound, he said seriously, "This is clearly an intentional injury. Should I call the police?"

William hadn't given any instructions, so Bob didn't dare make a decision.

"No need."

"Are you sure? This stab was almost fatal. If the dagger had a blood groove, it would have pierced his heart, and he wouldn't have survived," the doctor said suspiciously.

He looked at Bob as if he were a suspect, ready to call the police at any moment.

###chapter 128  Lucky Enough

At that moment, William, who had just been wheeled out of the hospital room, spoke up calmly, "No need. The dagger was just a decorative piece from the hotel. I tripped and it happened to stab me."

"Really? That was quite careless. You're lucky it wasn't worse," the doctor replied. Seeing that William was downplaying the incident, the doctor didn't press further. He simply reminded William to keep the wound dry and then quickly left.

Bob immediately stepped forward, shooing away the medical staff and taking over the wheelchair. "Whoever tried to kill Mr. Cavendish, you're not calling the police because you want to handle it yourself, right?"

"This matter is not up for discussion," William waved his hand dismissively.

Bob fell silent.

William asked, "Did you book the tickets?"

Bob, still worried, replied, "I did, but are you sure you want to travel such a long distance with your injury? Maybe we should..."

"Go home. Send the flight details to Christina," William's tone was resolute.

Bob knew that once William made a decision, it was nearly impossible to change his mind. So, he sent the flight information to Christina without further questioning.

The next day, as they boarded the plane, Christina showed up as expected.

The first thing she said upon seeing him was, "How do you plan to save Walter?"

"Don't mention that name in front of me, or I won't help him," William said weakly.

"I've already agreed to come back with you. We're on the plane now, and you still won't keep your promise?" Christina snapped, clearly irritated.

Bob, unable to stand it any longer, interjected, "Ms. Windsor, Mr. Cavendish's injury is severe. The dagger almost reached his heart. If it had gone any deeper, he could have died. You should..."

"What does that have to do with me?" Christina replied coldly.

William felt a chill in his heart, as if it had stopped beating altogether.

"Enough, stop talking!" William closed his eyes, signaling the end of the conversation.

Bob swallowed his words and fell silent.

Seven hours later, as the plane landed, Christina reminded him again, "You better keep your promise."

"If you don't trust me, you might as well stay by my side," William said with a faint smile. "Keep an eye on me."

"I'm not interested," Christina turned to leave.

William's eyes narrowed as he coldly threatened, "I'm not asking for your opinion. You have to come with me."

Having no other choice, Christina closed her eyes and nodded, resigned. "Fine."

She followed William back to the villa.

This place had once been their home. Or rather, it had been her home with Harper. After their marriage, William had given the villa to her and rarely came back.

Seeing the familiar surroundings, she felt a pang of nostalgia.

Thankfully, all traces of their past memories had been erased, allowing her to move freely without being overwhelmed by the past.

"From now on, you'll stay here," William said.

"What exactly do you want?" Christina stared into his eyes.

"Nothing. Just stay here," William replied before heading upstairs.

Christina was more confused than ever. What did he want? Wasn't a lifetime of torment enough? Did he want to continue torturing her in this life too?

She felt like a bird trapped in a cage, unable to escape his grasp.

But since he had promised to save Walter, she decided to wait until he fulfilled that promise before dealing with anything else.

Maybe it was the familiarity of the place, but she didn't sleep well that night. She kept dreaming of Harper, who stood at a distance, smiling at her.

"Mom."

"Harper!" she cried out in joy, rushing forward to hug the little girl.

But she stumbled and fell, and when she looked up, Harper was gone.

"Harper, are you mad at me for not keeping you? I miss you so much. Please don't hide from me."

Harper suddenly appeared behind her. "Mom, I'm not mad at you. Please stop thinking about me. I can't be happy in heaven if you keep this up."

"How can I not think about you? You're my only daughter. We've been through so much together. How can I just forget you?" Christina pleaded over and over.

"Harper, please come back. Come back to me."

Harper shook her head from a distance. "Mom, I have to go. Take care of yourself."

"No, Harper," Christina cried out, waking up in tears.

The dream felt so real, like reliving the past. In this world, it was just her and Harper, forever relying on each other.

Her tears flowed uncontrollably, like a broken dam.

Suddenly, the light turned on, exposing her vulnerability.

She looked up, dazed, and saw William standing at the door. She quickly masked her weakness with a tough demeanor. "What do you want?"

She remembered locking the door, but this was his place. It wasn't surprising he had a key. But why had he snuck into her room in the middle of the night?

"I heard you talking in your sleep," William said, stepping closer.

"So what?" Christina sneered, glaring at him with hatred. "If it weren't for you, I wouldn't miss her so much!"

William looked at her calmly. "I'm starting to believe you."

"I have no reason to lie to you, William. I hate you. How can you live with yourself?" Christina spat out each word with venom.

"If I die, Harper will never come back. If you miss her so much, we can bring her back," William said calmly.

"What do you mean? What are you planning?" Christina demanded, clenching her teeth.

William stepped closer. "Let's have a child."

"You're insane! Harper won't come back. What's the point of having a child without a father's love?" Christina was shocked. She couldn't believe he wanted to repeat the same tragedy.

"I failed you in the past. I won't fail you again. When Harper comes back, we'll be a family," William said, moving closer.

"You're delusional!" Christina pushed him away, accidentally pressing on his wound. He winced in pain.

Christina didn't hold back, pressing harder on his wound.

He gasped in pain.

###chapter 129  Are You Willing to Kill Me?

"Let go of me," Christina's voice was cold, completely devoid of warmth. "Or I'll kill you."

"Would you really kill me?" William chuckled softly, his eyes locked on hers.

Christina gave a faint smile. "Why don't you try me? If you want to see Harper, we can go to hell together. I'm not bringing her back into this world. She was born to suffer, and I won't let that happen again."

"You want to see Harper, don't you? You've dreamed of her, and so have I. She's such a sweet girl. I want to see our daughter," William said, struggling to hold back his pain.

Christina extended her hand, a calm smile on her face. "Aren't you just pathetic? We could have had a happy family, a lovely, obedient daughter. But you didn't want that. Fine, this life, you don't want it, so be it. But why go back to a life you didn't want before?"

William looked at her with deep affection. "I regret it, Christina. We can start over. We can bring Harper back."

"Start over?" Christina laughed mockingly.

"What right do you have to say that? I was the one who watched her suffer, die, and be cremated. I bore all that pain alone. Do you know how hard it was for me to cremate her? Do you know how much it hurt to take birth control pills to prevent bringing her into this world? You know nothing! How can you say such cold words so easily?"

William sighed deeply. It was too late. Why had he done such terrible things?

After much thought, he realized it was because he had deeply misunderstood Christina.

"Can you give me another chance?"

"No, William. In this life, I only hate you. I live with that hatred. I wish you were dead!" Christina pressed hard on his wound.

Blood gushed out.

William fell onto the bed in pain, holding her tightly.

"Christina..."

He whispered her name, but who knew what he was thinking? Was he regretting what had happened in that dream?

Christina stared wide-eyed, saying nothing.

The night passed like that.

Every moment she stayed there felt suffocating. The next day, when Christina tried to leave, she found two bodyguards at the door, blocking her way.

"Ms. Windsor, Mr. Cavendish has ordered that you cannot leave the house without his permission."

Christina sneered. "What is this? Illegal detention?"

"We're just following orders, Ms. Windsor. Please go back and don't make things difficult for us," one of the bodyguards said calmly.

"What if I insist on leaving?" Christina asked coldly.

The two burly bodyguards stood like immovable doors.

Christina had no way to get past them, so she turned back. She wanted to call for help but found her phone was missing. William had taken it the night before.

She went upstairs to the master bedroom to confront William. "What are you trying to do? Are you going to imprison me here for life? Don't make me hate you more!"

William looked up calmly, a bitter smile on his lips.

"You already want to kill me and have the guts to do it. Would hating me more make any difference?"

Since this was a given fact, he might as well take things to the extreme.

Christina took a deep breath. "What do you want? Are you going to imprison me here for life?"

"Of course not. Just until you give birth to our daughter..."

Christina let out a derisive laugh. "Don't kid yourself. I will never have another child with you. If Walter isn't safely back within a week, we'll go to hell together."

With that, she turned and left the bedroom.

William watched her retreating figure, a bitter smile on his lips, and couldn't help but cough violently.

In the afternoon, the cook came in. "Mr. Cavendish, Ms. Windsor has locked herself in her room. We brought her food, but she hasn't touched it."

Was she trying to starve herself?

"I'll go check on her." William got up and went to the adjacent room.

Christina lay on the bed, a coat draped over her, still drawing with a pencil.

She wanted to die, but she also wanted to fulfill her commitments and not cause trouble for anyone.

"Are you trying to starve yourself to force me?" William sat beside her. "If you die and I don't, won't that make you, who wants me dead, even more upset?"

"You have power and influence. What can I do to you? I'm counting on you to save someone. I'll drink water for a few days. After three days, I'll stop drinking and eating. If there's no news of Walter's safety in seven days, let me starve to death." Christina continued drawing calmly.

William snatched her sketchpad. "Do you think you can threaten me like this?"

"I never thought my insignificant life could threaten you. I can't decide how I live, but I can decide how I die. William, if there's another life, I'll kill you myself and end everything before it starts." Christina looked up, her pale face showing a smile.

He suddenly leaned forward, pinning her to the bed.

"Do you still have the strength to resist me without eating?"

"Do whatever you want. My soul is already gone. What's left is just a shell. Do as you please!" Christina closed her eyes.

William's passionate kisses fell on her lips. She didn't resist, just closed her eyes like a dying butterfly, its wings broken, devoid of its former brilliance.

"Christina, I really want Harper back."

William said sincerely, undressing her, his kisses falling like raindrops.

Christina kept her eyes closed, like a puppet, unmoving.

"Harper is gone. She won't come back. She was our first child. Even if we have more children, they won't be Harper. William, I won't have your child. Stop dreaming!"

William continued kissing her, his fingers tightly interlocked with hers. That night, he made love to her many times, but Christina remained silent, her eyes as lifeless as a still pond, showing no emotion.

###chapter 130 Can Only Lock Her

The morning sun rose gently.

William rubbed his chin against Christina's head, planting a soft kiss on her forehead.

After a night of stiffness, Christina finally showed some reaction, turning her face away in disdain.

His warm body pressed tightly against Christina, and he whispered in her ear, "Christina, what do I have to do for you to stop hating me? Should I marry you?"

Christina remained unmoved.

Marriage was just another shackle. Such a shackle couldn't bind William; he still yearned for freedom outside. This shackle could only bind her.

She said nothing.

William suddenly pressed down on her.

"Are you just going to stay silent like this?"

Christina continued to stare at the ceiling, as if her soul had been extracted, leaving only a shell. He suddenly understood the meaning behind her words. She was just a shell; he could have it, but he would never get Christina's heart.

"Once you have a child, everything will be better."

William said this as if trying to deceive himself.

A whole day passed, and Christina still didn't touch anything, just sat quietly on the bed, occasionally looking out the window with the same empty gaze.

At night, William came again. He picked Christina up, threw her on the bed, and pressed down on her.

Christina just opened her eyes wide, silently enduring.

He vented his anger and desire, his movements becoming more intense. But then he suddenly realized that Christina had closed her eyes at some point, as if she had lost consciousness!

He immediately pulled away, gently shaking Christina, calling her name softly.

"Christina, Christina!"

She didn't respond at all.

In that moment, he panicked and quickly called Joseph over.

Joseph checked her pulse.

"What happened? It seems like low blood sugar?"

"She's been fasting," William said, frowning.

Joseph raised an eyebrow. "Why would she fast? What's going on? And why is she here with you?"

"Why are you asking so many questions?" William snapped. "Just do what you need to do."

"I really can't figure you out," Joseph said, bringing in a nutrient drip for her. "This can temporarily replace nutrients, but if this continues, it will be a double blow to her body and mind."

William frowned, saying nothing.

Joseph sighed and tentatively asked, "You didn't... illegally detain Christina, did you? She's fasting in protest, and I noticed the security here is much tighter than before."

Joseph himself found the idea absurd.

He never expected William to remain silent.

If William hadn't done it, he would have denied it. His silence seemed like an admission, and Joseph was shocked. "I knew something was off between you two. William, my dear Mr. Cavendish, what are you trying to do?"

William sighed, saying nothing.

Joseph gritted his teeth, frustrated. "Weren't you doing fine with Jennifer? You were even talking about marriage. Why are you so fixated on Christina? She's your niece by name. Are you into forbidden love?"

William took a deep breath. "Maybe it's fate."

"Fate? Seriously?" Joseph scoffed. "I think you're just bored and want to torment her. Now Christina's half-dead because of you. If Jennifer finds out, she'll be furious."

William stayed silent. He had endured so long, just trying to choose the right path.

Joseph, seeing his indifference, became even more frustrated. "Go ahead, make a scene. Let's see how far this goes."

"You don't understand," William closed his eyes.

Joseph sneered. "You're right, I don't understand. I don't understand how someone like you could have such a twisted hobby."

"Leave," William didn't want to argue anymore.

Joseph snorted and left the room. William sat by the bed, looking at Christina's pale face, feeling a mix of emotions.

He reached out, gently stroking her cheek, his eyes full of complexity. "Christina, what do I have to do for you to forgive me?"

Christina kept her eyes closed, unresponsive.

William sighed, got up, and left the room. He sat in his study, lighting a cigarette. The smoke swirled around him, his gaze growing deeper.

He took out his phone and called Bob. "How's the situation with Walter?"

"Mr. Cavendish, the Moore Family couldn't withstand the pressure and has given in."

Bob took a deep breath.

"That's good," William didn't want to deal with Walter, but he couldn't watch Christina starve herself to death.

The next morning, when he went to check on Christina, she was awake. The nutrient drip was only half-finished, and she had pulled out the needle, sitting by the bed, pale and silent.

"Do you really want to die?" William chuckled.

"Death would be a relief," Christina smiled weakly.

"There's news about Walter. He'll be back safely soon. Eat something, don't harm your body," William placed the prepared breakfast in front of her.

Christina pushed it away, knocking it to the floor.

"I'm not eating!"

William looked at the mess, a flash of anger in his eyes, but he controlled himself, speaking as calmly as possible.

"Christina, you're hurting yourself and me. Walter is safe now. Why can't you let go of your obsession?"

Christina glanced at him coldly, her voice weak but firm. "Obsession? Is it your obsession with me, or my hatred for you? William, stop pretending. Do you think saving Walter can make up for the harm you've done to me?"

William took a deep breath. He knew that no matter what he said, Christina wouldn't easily believe him. He stood up, walked to the window, and looked at the bright sunshine outside, but his heart was shrouded in darkness.

At that moment, he saw Nicholas's car approaching, stopping at the door.

Nicholas rarely came here. His sudden arrival suggested he had heard something, though it was unclear how the information had leaked.

At the door, Nicholas glanced at the bodyguard. "Are William and Christina both here?"

###chapter 131 Don't Think About Taking Her Away

The two bodyguards, not daring to lie to Nicholas, reluctantly nodded.

Nicholas stormed in, furious. "I knew it! Christina's still up to no good, trying to seduce William."

The bodyguards didn't dare stop him, especially since Nicholas had brought several people with him, clearly intent on breaking up William and Christina.

Hearing the commotion, William came downstairs. "Dad, what are you doing here?"

"If I hadn't come, how would I know about the filthy things going on between you two? William, Christina has had bad intentions from the start. How could you be fooled by her? I'm taking her away. The Cavendish family won't tolerate someone like her. She and her mother need to get out of our family."

Nicholas started to head upstairs with his entourage.

"Dad, you're too old to be worrying about these things," William said calmly.

"If I don't worry, are you just going to let Christina and her mother manipulate you?" Nicholas scoffed, gritting his teeth. "Drag her down here."

William stood at the foot of the stairs, blocking their way. "This isn't Christina's fault. I insisted on keeping her here. The bodyguards at the door are there to watch her. If you take her away, I won't have any happiness left in my life."

"What did you say?" Nicholas couldn't believe his ears.

William glanced upstairs, a bitter smile on his lips. "Maybe some things were wrong from the start."

"William, aren't you afraid of what people will say about you?" Nicholas stomped his cane in anger. "Don't forget, she's your niece."

"Not by blood," William replied indifferently.

Nicholas was livid, ordering his men to go upstairs and drag Christina out of her room. William rushed up, shielding Christina behind him.

"You won't take her unless you step over my dead body."

Christina's expression was dazed, hunger making it impossible for her to focus. She let them pull her around without resistance.

William shouted, "Enough! I have the right to decide who I want to be with. Dad, you should leave. I'll handle everything else."

Nicholas looked at him in disbelief, noticing Christina's odd state. What was going on?

William called for more bodyguards. They wouldn't touch Nicholas, but they had no qualms about dealing with his men.

Once the hall quieted down, William said calmly, "Dad, please go home."

"You're really protecting her?" Nicholas took a few steps back in anger. "This is a disaster for our family!"

Worried about his father's health, William quickly instructed the nearby bodyguards to take Nicholas to the hospital for a check-up.

The chaos finally subsided.

Christina, like a lifeless shell, staggered back to her room and curled up tightly under the covers.

William approached her, but she didn't make a sound, her breathing so faint it seemed she had no life left.

"Aren't you afraid I won't save Walter if you keep being so stubborn?"

"I've already agreed to your terms. I'm not negotiating anything else with you, you devil. If you have the guts, kill me. Otherwise, don't expect me to give in!" Christina turned her face away after saying this.

William was at his wit's end with her.

Christina closed her eyes again.

Maybe it was the hunger, but she quickly fell asleep.

When she opened her eyes, Harper was suddenly beside her, holding her hand tightly.

"Mommy, Mommy."

"Harper." Christina sat up in surprise, rubbing her eyes hard. "Am I dreaming?"

What was happening? Could it be that God had pity on her and sent her back to a time when Harper was still around?

She immediately grabbed Harper's hand. "We can't stay here. Your dad wants you dead. We need to leave the country!"

Harper blinked her big eyes. "Mommy, what are you talking about? Daddy said he's taking us to the amusement park today. He already bought the tickets. We're just waiting for you to get up."

What? How could that be? In her memory, William had never been close to Harper and didn't allow her to call him dad.

He had said his only child was Mike!

Harper snuggled into her arms, pouting. "Mommy, Mommy, get up. Let's go to the amusement park."

While Christina was still in a daze, William walked in. Today, he was dressed casually, looking gentle and peaceful, completely different from the cold man in her memories.

"You..."

Before she could finish, William walked over and kissed her forehead.

"Get up. You're a mom now, and you still need your daughter to wake you up. Aren't you ashamed? Should I carry you out of bed?"

"You two are so mushy." Harper pouted and ran off.

It was too perfect, almost unreal.

Their outfits were already laid out, matching casual clothes. When she came out, she realized they were all dressed the same, like a family set.

"Are we really going out like this?" Christina asked instinctively, because William never wanted to expose their relationship in public.

William smiled gently. "Of course. If it makes the kid happy, why not? What's one day of looking silly?"

"What's silly about it? I picked the best colors," Harper protested.

Christina took a deep breath. Now, the three of them were a happy family, the sun shining brightly. She no longer doubted. They each took one of Harper's hands.

"I want to make clay figures!" As soon as they arrived at the amusement park, Harper spotted a clay figure stall.

William agreed readily, showing no impatience. "Alright, whatever you want."

Harper sat happily at the stall, molding the clay. "This one's Daddy, and this one's Mommy."

"Mommy's not pretty enough," William said, his large hand covering hers, helping her mold Christina's figure.

The two of them working together made Christina's eyes well up with tears.

She wiped her eyes, not knowing why she was crying. It all felt so unreal!

"What's wrong?" William noticed her emotions and asked with concern.

"I just feel so happy. I had a terrible nightmare last night," Christina shook her head.

###chapter 132: What Nightmare?

"What kind of nightmare? Must've been pretty bad," William said, noticing the tears in Christina's eyes.

"I dreamt..." Christina started, then shook her head. "Never mind, no point in dwelling on it. Let's finish this clay figurine and get it to the shop to be fired. We can hit the amusement park now and pick it up later tonight."

It was probably just a dream.

William, always patient with Harper, stood by her side. Whatever Harper wanted to do, he was there with her.

Harper was having a blast. As they were leaving, she said, "I haven't had enough fun yet."

William playfully tapped her nose. "Didn't we say we were going to the aquarium too? If we don't go now, it'll be closed. So, you wanna stay here or head to the aquarium?"

Harper thought for a moment and then said seriously, "Let's go to the aquarium."

William chuckled. "I knew you couldn't resist the aquarium."

They headed to the aquarium together.

William seemed well-prepared, sharing his extensive knowledge about marine life with Harper.

Harper listened intently, occasionally asking questions.

Christina stood a short distance away, feeling deeply moved and happy. Tears streamed down her face without her realizing it.

She wiped her eyes, the cold tears stinging her heart. Suddenly, the scene changed, and everything vanished, leaving her in a desolate wasteland. She called out in terror.

"Harper, Harper!"

No one responded. The silence was overwhelming, as if she was the only person left in the world.

She jolted awake, a sense of loss washing over her. It was just a dream. How could William ever be so kind and attentive to Harper? Over the years, she and Harper had endured the disdain of the Cavendish family and William's neglect. How could he ever acknowledge this daughter?

It was just a beautiful fantasy. None of it could happen in reality. If it could, the past wouldn't have ended the way it did.

She wiped her tears and sat up, not wanting to sleep again for fear of more dreams. Her stomach growled loudly.

She was starving, but she had no appetite.

Unexpectedly, the housekeeper came in. "Mr. Cavendish wants you to come to the dining room."

Christina looked up and scoffed. "I'm not going."

"Mr. Cavendish said you would be interested in this news," the housekeeper added.

Christina thought for a moment and decided to go downstairs. She hadn't eaten in days, and her steps were unsteady. She managed to make it to the dining room, where William sat at the far end of the long table.

"Eat something. Walter is back."

"Really? I don't believe you. I want to call him." Christina took a deep breath.

William stared at her for a long moment before handing her the phone. "Go ahead."

Christina dialed the number.

Walter answered quickly. "Christina, are you okay?"

"I'm fine. Are you back in the country?" Christina asked anxiously.

"Yeah, I'm back. Don't worry, I'm safe. Who did you ask for help to get me back?" Walter inquired.

Christina sighed in relief. "Don't worry about that. I'm just glad you're back."

"Where are you? Can we meet?" Walter asked.

"No need," Christina replied coldly. "I have things to do. It's not convenient."

Walter sensed something was off in her tone and was about to ask more when the call abruptly ended.

Christina looked at William in shock. "What are you doing?"

"He's safe now. There's no need for you to talk further. Eat," William said coolly.

Christina bit her lip. She had said she wouldn't harm herself, and with Walter safe, she had no reason to. She sat down and began eating, though she was a bit messy from not having eaten in days.

Her phone rang again, and she reached for it, but William grabbed it first.

She looked at him calmly. "Are you going to keep me from contacting the outside world forever?"

William pushed a glass of milk towards her. "Drink this."

Christina turned to leave, refusing to comply.

William sighed and handed her the phone. "Answer it."

Christina answered the call.

It was from the architecture firm. The assistant asked, "Ms. Windsor, you haven't been to the office in days. Are you planning to resign?"

"No, I'm not," Christina replied calmly.

The assistant nodded. "Your leave ended yesterday. When will you return?"

"Tomorrow," Christina said firmly.

William frowned slightly at her decision. "You're going out?"

"Do you forbid it? Are you really going to ruin my career and keep me locked up forever? If that's your plan, I can't stop you. Do as you wish," Christina said with a cold smile after hanging up.

William propped his chin on his hand and looked at her. "Will you run away?"

"Of course not. I hate you, William. I hate you so much I want to stay by your side and find a chance to kill you. Why would I give up such a good opportunity?" Christina glared at him, her face full of hatred.

"Fine. I don't care if you hate me. I just want you to stay with me," William said with a light laugh, seemingly accepting her hatred.

The next day, Christina went to the architecture firm. She could feel someone following her, but she didn't care. Let them follow.

On her way home from work, a car suddenly sped towards her. It didn't seem out of control; it was aiming for her. As she tried to dodge, the car adjusted its path to hit her.

It was intentional!

Christina's heart raced. The car was getting closer, and she couldn't avoid it. But then, someone pulled her out of the way.

With a loud crash, the car hit someone.

She turned and saw that it was William, lying on the ground, blood pooling around him. People rushed over, shouting, "Mr. Cavendish! Mr. Cavendish!"

###chapter 133 Taking Advantage of the Weakness

She stood there, frozen, like she hadn't heard a thing.

She never expected William to get hit by a car.

And yet, he was still smiling at her?

What was going on?

If it wasn't William who got hit, it would have been her.

Christina felt a chill run down her spine.

She watched as the ambulance took William away, sitting on the curb, unable to snap out of it.

Scenes like this never happened in her past life.

In her previous life, even if she had died in front of William, he wouldn't have batted an eye, let alone risk his life to save her.

In this life, she had planned to get revenge on William, but why was everything going so differently from what she had imagined? She was on the verge of breaking down.

Why? Why?

Why did William save her?

She wandered aimlessly down the street, eventually tripping and falling. She didn't even have the strength to get up.

So she just sat there, hugging herself, her mind filled with memories of her past and present with William.

When she finally tried to get up, a group of men in black surrounded her.

Instinctively, Christina tried to run, but these men closed in on her like a giant net, trapping her in the center.

She was no match for them.

Who could she call for help now?

Just as they were about to force her into a van, Bob appeared.

Bob shielded her, glaring coldly at the men. "Mr. Cavendish has made it clear: anyone who harms Ms. Windsor will have to answer to him. If you don't want to die, get lost."

With Bob and the police nearby, the men had no choice but to retreat.

Bob took Christina back to William's villa.

He warned her, "Ms. Windsor, it's best if you stay in the villa for now. If you must go out, I'll arrange for protection. But be careful, or I won't be able to explain it to Mr. Cavendish."

Christina said nothing. Bob thought she might ask about William, but she didn't say a word.

In fact, during the days William was in the hospital, Christina didn't call once.

Meanwhile, the men who Bob had chased away made a phone call.

"Mr. Cavendish's assistant took Christina. We can't get to her."

"Understood."

Nicholas was furious. He saw Christina as a troublemaker and wanted her gone for good.

Because of Christina, William had broken the rules multiple times. Nicholas had thought Christina wanted to marry William, but even after he threatened her, she refused.

Now, with things like this, he couldn't contain his anger.

But it seemed William was determined to protect Christina.

Fine, let them be. If they want to get married, let them. If not, let them torment each other.

As for Christina, she continued with her life as usual, not visiting William.

She had her doubts and fears. She was afraid that seeing William would make her waver even more, so she held back.

A few days later, Christina got a call from Mia. "Hey, Christina! You saved my life last time, and I've been wanting to thank you. Now that everything at home is settled and those two thugs got what they deserved, if you're free today, let's meet up?"

Christina had a good impression of Mia.

Plus, Mia had mentioned needing help with several home renovations, which would be a big job for Christina.

"Sure, I'm free now. Where should we meet?"

"How about the coffee shop where we first met? By the way, Christina, you're still single, right?" Mia glanced at her cousin, Alex Wilson, and had an idea.

Christina nodded, "Yeah, I'm single."

"Great, see you soon."

After hanging up, Mia turned to Alex. "Hey, get me a glass of water and peel two apples."

Alex looked at her with a pained expression.

He flopped onto the couch. "Mia, I'm already being bossed around by Mom and Dad at home. I came here to relax, and now you're bossing me around too. I'll peel the apples, but you have to promise to fend off my parents when they start nagging me about marriage."

Mia couldn't help but laugh.

Alex wasn't that old, but his parents were relentless and loved to nag.

"I'll put in a good word for you, but are you really not interested in dating?" Mia probed.

Alex's expression grew even more forlorn. "Mia, we're just talking. Why bring up my sore spot? Dating isn't something I can decide on my own. It takes the right person. If I don't meet someone suitable, there's nothing I can do."

He couldn't just stop a random woman on the street and ask her out, could he?

Besides, he had his own preferences.

"How about I introduce you to someone? She's a bit younger than you, very pretty, and really smart. But we have to agree on this: if you say yes, you have to be all in and treat her well. No mistreating her." Mia laid down the rules.

Alex nodded eagerly. "You know me. I'm serious about relationships. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been single for so long."

He was telling the truth.

Mia and Alex had grown up together, and she knew his character. "Alright, get ready. We're going for coffee soon."

"Got it, I'm on it." Alex jumped up from the couch.

Meanwhile, Christina got dressed and headed out. She had a nagging feeling that someone was following her.

It was probably William's men again.

Annoyed, she sent a message: [If you're going to have someone follow me, at least get someone competent. Or are you planning another car accident to gain my sympathy?]

William was busy and didn't see her message right away, so he didn't respond.

Christina assumed he was guilty.

She put her phone away and continued walking. As she crossed an intersection, a car suddenly sped towards her.

She tried to dodge, but the car hit her, sending her flying and leaving her in a pool of blood.

###chapter 134  You Have Amnesia, Right?

The driver didn't even bother getting out of the car; he just sped off, leaving the accident scene behind.

It hit her that this wasn't some old trick being replayed but a deliberate attempt to hurt her. The previous accident involving William had made her let her guard down.

The only person who could know all this, besides Jennifer, was no one else she could think of.

Passersby were horrified by the scene. Some good Samaritans immediately pulled out their phones to call the police, while others called for an ambulance.

When Christina woke up again, three whole days had passed.

Elisa was in the hospital room, her tears nearly dried up from crying. She kept asking the doctor over and over, "The surgery's done, right? And you said it was successful. So why hasn't my daughter woken up yet?"

"I understand your concern, but a successful surgery doesn't mean the patient will recover immediately. She still needs to get through the critical post-surgery period," the doctor tried to explain.

But Elisa couldn't hear any of it.

She only cared about one thing, "Then tell me, when exactly will my daughter wake up?"

"We can't give a precise answer to that. We just have to be patient. She might wake up today," the doctor said, trying to comfort her.

But Elisa had had enough of these vague answers. "You're doctors, aren't you? How can you not know when my daughter will wake up? I want to transfer her to another hospital. I want a better specialist for my daughter."

In her eyes, life had just started to get back on track.

Christina had stopped talking about leaving the Cavendish family, and she had been staying at William's villa for the past few days. Soon, they could have their wedding.

With Nicholas personally overseeing everything, no one would dare say a word.

But now!

Her daughter had suddenly been in a car accident, lying in a coma for three days with no sign of waking up.

"Transferring her is an option, but as a doctor, I don't recommend it right now. Your daughter needs rest," the doctor tried to continue.

Elisa cut him off, "Either you wake my daughter up now, or you shut up!"

"Doctor, you should go. I'll talk to her," William couldn't stand it anymore.

After the doctor left, he walked over to Elisa. "This is the best hospital in the country, with the best specialists. Christina will wake up. She's just sleeping now."

He wasn't just saying this to comfort Elisa; he was also trying to reassure himself.

When he got the call and rushed to the hospital, seeing Christina lying in a pool of blood, he had panicked.

He couldn't imagine what he would do if he lost Christina.

If she could wake up, even if she still hated him as much as before, he would accept it.

All he wanted now was for her to wake up, nothing more.

"William, what am I supposed to do? I can't do anything but watch. I'm too scared to even touch my daughter," Elisa sobbed.

Christina was hooked up to tubes, with machines monitoring her vitals. What mother wouldn't be heartbroken seeing this?

"We'll wait a little longer. I have a feeling Christina will wake up today," William said, handing Elisa a tissue. "You need to be strong now."

"Yes, I need to be strong," Elisa murmured, wiping her tears, which only seemed to flow more.

As William reached for another tissue, Christina's eyelids fluttered.

He froze, staring at Christina, filled with hope.

Was she waking up, or was it just his imagination?

The next second, Christina opened her eyes.

She heard the crying beside her and saw the two people in front of her, feeling everything was so unfamiliar.

"You're awake?" William couldn't contain his excitement.

He wasn't dreaming or imagining things; Christina was really awake.

This meant she had passed the critical period and would be okay. He wouldn't lose her.

"Christina?" Elisa looked up and met her eyes.

All the emotions she had been holding back burst out as she hugged Christina tightly, tears streaming down. "You're finally awake. You have no idea how these three days have been for me. I wanted to pass out with you."

Christina was confused by her sudden warmth.

Her mind was blank, like a baby learning to walk, everything around her unfamiliar.

She didn't recognize the two people in front of her, but their excitement suggested they knew her well. "Who are you?"

"What? Christina, are you joking? Don't joke like this," Elisa trembled uncontrollably.

How could this be?

How could Christina not know who they were?

William initially thought Christina was joking.

But then he saw the confusion in her eyes, devoid of the love and hate she once had.

No one could act that well, and Christina hated him too much to lie at a time like this.

There was only one possibility.

"You've lost your memory, haven't you?" William asked, though his tone was certain.

Christina nodded. "I can't remember anything. I don't know who you are or why I'm here. Can you tell me what our relationship is?"

Elisa snapped out of it and ran out of the room.

She hurriedly called the doctor, "My daughter is awake."

"That's great news. Waking up means she's out of danger."

"But she doesn't remember anything, not even me, her mother. What's going on?" Elisa grabbed the doctor's arm. "Doctor, please help my daughter."

Though she had been harsh before, for a cancer patient who had just come to terms with her illness, only to face her daughter's accident and uncertain fate, it was too much to bear.

The doctor understood and didn't hold it against her. "Your daughter has a blood clot in her head, which might be causing temporary or permanent amnesia. We'll need to treat her to find out more."

###chapter 135  You Took the Initiative to Greet Me?

"Is this gonna mess with her health?" Elisa was still super worried.

A head injury sounded really serious.

The doctor shook his head. "No major issues. She just lost her memory, but it won't mess with her daily life. Spend more time with her. She might remember stuff on her own. We've seen cases like this before."

Elisa tried to comfort herself with that thought.

At least Christina was awake now. She was alive and okay.

In the hospital room, Christina asked William again, "So, what's our deal? You said she's my mom, but you won't tell me who you are to me."

They couldn't be enemies, right?

If that were the case, he wouldn't be here, looking at her with such concern.

"Fiancés," William finally said.

He reached out to gently stroke Christina's hair. "We were about to get married, but you had an accident and have been in the hospital for three days. We had to postpone the wedding. We can't have you walking down the aisle like this."

"Is that so?" Christina looked at him.

He seemed sincere, not like he was lying.

If they were engaged, she should feel comfortable being close to him. But something inside her kept telling her to stay away from this man.

"Of course it's true. Our families have agreed to our marriage. If you don't believe me, I'll take you home after you're discharged. You can see for yourself. I can't possibly get everyone to lie to you," William said smoothly.

Both Raymond's family and Nicholas wanted them to get married as soon as possible.

As for the rest of the Cavendish family, even if they had objections, they wouldn't dare voice them.

"We've even been in the news a few times. We have fans online wishing us well," William added, leaving Christina stunned.

"Am I a celebrity?" she asked, puzzled.

"Of course not. Why would you think that?" William chuckled. "You're still a student, you haven't graduated yet. If you want to be a celebrity, I can help."

He didn't own a talent agency, but he could ask his partners to look out for Christina.

She wouldn't face any of the usual pitfalls.

Christina shook her head. "I don't want that. It's just strange. If I'm not a celebrity, why would people care about our relationship?"

People usually only follow celebrities' private lives.

How could ordinary people like them have fans?

"Maybe because we're part of the Cavendish family."

"Are we family? Can we get married?" Christina asked again.

William found her current state adorable. He couldn't resist pulling her into a hug. "How about this? Promise me you'll take care of yourself and get better. Once you're out of the hospital, I'll answer all your questions."

"Alright," Christina agreed after thinking it over. "When can I leave? I don't like it here. The smell of disinfectant is awful."

Elisa returned with the doctor to see this scene.

"What's that noise? Who's here?" Christina was startled.

The doctor approached her. "I'm your attending physician. I'm here to check on you. Do you remember anything, or just not recognize them?"

Christina shook her head. "I don't remember anything. My mind is blank."

"I'll schedule a CT scan to check your brain. Then I'll adjust your medication based on your condition."

Christina got out of bed.

William followed her closely as they left the room.

Seeing this, Elisa felt a bit happier.

Elisa suddenly thought that Christina's amnesia might not be so bad. As long as it didn't affect her health, it could even strengthen their relationship.

Once they were married and had children, Christina would look back on this time and be grateful.

With them together, Elisa decided not to interfere.

She quietly left.

William stayed with Christina through all the tests. While waiting for the results, Christina was anxious. "What if I'm not healthy?"

"Then I'll stay with you until you are," William reassured her, gently patting her back.

Joseph rushed over when he heard Christina was awake. Seeing their interaction, he slapped himself.

It hurt.

He wasn't dreaming.

Was Christina crazy?

"Who is he?" Christina noticed the commotion and frowned. "He seems a bit odd."

"That's my friend, Joseph. He's a doctor," William introduced him briefly.

Although Christina's first impression of Joseph wasn't great, he was her fiancé's friend, so she had to be polite.

When Joseph approached, she extended her hand. "Hello, Joseph."

"You greeted me first?" Joseph was even more surprised.

What a joke!

The first time they met, Christina had been downright hostile. He still got angry thinking about it.

Their subsequent encounters were always confrontational.

But now, Christina was being so friendly that he wondered if she had lost her mind. "Are you crazy?"

"What?" Christina was taken aback.

She looked at William, confused. "Your friend doesn't seem to like me. Did we have a falling out?"

"Of course not. You two just met today. He had an argument with someone else, so he's in a bad mood," William lied.

He liked the current Christina.

The past was the past. People needed to move forward.

Joseph's eyes nearly popped out.

Weird. Both William and Christina were acting weird.

While Christina was with the doctor, Joseph pulled William aside, speaking seriously. "Tell me the truth. What's going on with you two? Did Christina get hit by a car and lose her mind?"

###chapter 136 You Give Up

"She's lost her memory. She doesn't remember anything or recognize any of us," William explained quickly.

Joseph finally got it.

No wonder Christina seemed so different now. Something was definitely off.

"So, what's your plan?" Joseph asked, recalling the rumors. "Now that Christina has amnesia, you could use this chance to distance yourself from her."

William stayed silent.

He knew it was a good opportunity, but he didn't want to take it.

"Don't tell me you actually want to marry her?" Joseph raised his voice. "Come on, are you in love with her? Even if you are, does she love you? Her current attitude is only because she's lost her memory. What happens when she remembers everything?"

When that time comes, Christina would only hate him more.

What was William thinking?

Joseph couldn't wrap his head around it. "If you were a guy who couldn't find a partner, I'd understand. But you're not. You could find a much better wife."

Even without considering family background or looks, at least he wouldn't end up with someone like Christina, who was sharp-tongued and never spoke kindly.

William shook his head. "I know what I'm doing."

"Alright, I won't try to convince you anymore," Joseph conceded.

Though they were good friends, marriage was a personal decision.

If William was willing, what could he do?

Just then, Christina came out with the doctor, holding her medical report.

"Ms. Windsor's condition is better than I expected. The brain hemorrhage isn't severe. I recommend conservative treatment, letting the hemorrhage dissipate on its own. It might take longer, but it's the least harmful to her body," the doctor suggested.

William was fully supportive. "Let's do that."

"I'm going back to my room. Will you come with me?" Christina asked, looking up at him.

The sunlight fell perfectly on her face, highlighting her delicate and gentle features.

William felt his heart stir.

He couldn't help but recall the scenes from his dreams.

"Why aren't you saying anything?" Christina asked again, not getting a response.

William took her hand. "Nothing, let's go back to your room."

Watching them walk away, Joseph shook his head.

Fate was truly unpredictable. Who would have thought Christina would lose her memory at such a crucial time?

But maybe it was for the best. The amnesiac Christina was much more pleasant, and there was no need for any psychological counseling.

For several days, William delegated most of his work to his assistant. The urgent tasks he had to handle himself, he did from the hospital room.

"You should go to the office. I can take care of myself. You don't need to be here all the time," Christina said, increasingly convinced they were engaged.

Otherwise, why would he prioritize her so much?

William shook his head. "I don't need to clock in. As long as I get my work done, it's fine."

"But the table in the room is too low. It's uncomfortable for you. And if I have my phone on, it'll disturb you," Christina argued.

William handed her some fruit. "It's fine. I have noise-canceling headphones."

Despite his words, Christina still kept her phone volume low.

Elisa visited a few times, always smiling at how well they got along. "Christina, once you're better, we'll plan your wedding, okay?"

"Mom, I think we should wait. There's no rush," Christina instinctively wanted to delay.

Elisa wouldn't agree.

She wanted them to marry while Christina still had amnesia.

If they waited until Christina remembered everything, who knew what would happen?

"Christina, your relationship is stable, and you've met each other's families. You were already planning the wedding. Why wait?" Elisa held Christina's hand. "Is there something he's not doing right?"

Christina shook her head.

William was great, but she had been waking up in the middle of the night, subconsciously avoiding the idea of marriage.

She trusted her intuition. "I want to wait until the hemorrhage is gone and I remember our past. I can't get married without knowing our history."

"Christina, I understand, but marriage isn't just about you two. It's about the whole family. Everyone is looking forward to it. And I have late-stage cancer. I can't wait," Elisa's eyes welled up.

Christina was shocked.

Late-stage cancer?

She wasn't stupid. She knew what that meant. Elisa might not have much time left.

No wonder Elisa was pushing for the wedding.

Elisa called William over. "Do you want to marry sooner or later? Nicholas said he hopes for a wedding soon."

"Let's follow Nicholas's wishes."

Christina didn't expect them to agree.

If she made everyone wait because of her, it would be selfish.

Her mom said their relationship was stable, so it shouldn't matter when they married.

"Okay, I'll try on wedding dresses after I'm discharged," Christina agreed.

William's heart skipped a beat.

Christina was already beautiful. In a wedding dress, she'd be stunning.

"Great, I'll help you pick the perfect dress. You'll be the most beautiful bride," Elisa promised.

She looked at Christina and then at William, completely satisfied.

The whole Cavendish family knew about Christina's accident.

Walter had been worried for days until he heard she was awake.

She wouldn't be discharged for a while, so he wanted to visit her.

"Walter, where are you going?" Gabrielle stormed in.

She threw the supplements he was holding to the ground. "Don't think I don't know. Are you going to see that bitch Christina? Forget it. Stay home."

###chapter 137 You Know It in Your Heart

Gabrielle just couldn't wrap her head around it.

There were so many amazing women out there, so why was Walter so hung up on Christina?

Setting aside her mutual dislike with Elisa, there were all those complicated feelings between Christina and William, and Nicholas even wanted them to get married.

So what was Walter doing by getting involved?

Being a lover?

Just the thought of it made her dizzy.

"Who said I was going to see Christina? I have a friend who's sick, and I need to visit him, so I prepared some gifts," Walter lied, knowing Gabrielle's bias against Christina.

Gabrielle didn't buy it and wasn't willing to take any chances. "No way, you're staying home today. I won't let you go out."

Walter had no choice but to keep postponing his visit to Christina.

It wasn't until she was cleared by the doctor to be discharged that he got another chance.

Upon hearing the news, Christina was overjoyed. "So I can go home tomorrow?"

"Not tomorrow, you can go home today," the doctor smiled. "Just remember to rest as I advised and watch your diet. If you can supplement your nutrition, you'll recover faster."

Given Christina's current condition, her body was severely depleted and needed proper care.

"I'll take good care of her, thank you, doctor," William assured.

On the drive home, Christina asked, "Have we been living together this whole time?"

"Of course," William replied while driving.

He was telling the truth, but he didn't mention that Christina had been unwilling during that time.

"But today, we're not going home right away. We're going to the Cavendish Mansion. Nicholas has arranged a party for you and wants to discuss our wedding."

"Alright, I just got out of the hospital, so I should visit the elders," Christina agreed without much thought.

Soon, they arrived at the Cavendish Mansion and walked in together.

The entire Cavendish family was present, including Walter. Seeing William and Christina walk in side by side made him feel awful.

This wasn't how it was supposed to be.

He was certain Christina didn't like William, so why did they seem so close now?

He had too many questions but couldn't ask them in this setting.

"Nicholas, we're back," Christina greeted Nicholas.

Seeing her now, Nicholas found it strange. "How did a few days in the hospital change you so much?"

"She had a head injury and lost her memory. She doesn't remember anything," William explained briefly.

William's words were casual, but they hit Walter hard, causing him to drop his fork.

"Pick it up," Gabrielle whispered, her eyes warning him.

He should know what he was doing.

Walter bent down to pick up the fork, swallowing all his bitterness. He couldn't understand how Christina had lost her memory and forgotten everything.

No wonder she was acting so differently; she wasn't the same person anymore.

"Forgot everything? That's impressive," Nicholas remarked, his attitude towards Christina lukewarm.

Initially, Nicholas wanted to separate William and Christina after William got hurt.

But young people have their own ideas, and he had no choice but to accept Christina.

Now that Christina had amnesia, he couldn't hold it against her. "Alright, sit down. Since you don't remember anything, take this opportunity to get to know everyone. Don't go out and not recognize your own family."

"Okay," Christina replied, sensing that Nicholas didn't like her much.

Now wasn't the time to ask about it.

She raised her glass and greeted everyone. When it was Walter's turn, William's face darkened.

He stood up and took the glass from Christina. "Too much juice isn't good for you. I'll drink this for you. This is Walter, just say hello."

Christina smiled at Walter and then sat down.

She didn't look at Walter again, instead texting William: "You said no one at home would bully me, but I feel like many of them don't like me."

Though they hadn't said anything harsh, Christina could sense it from their expressions.

"You're overthinking it. Enjoy your meal; tonight's dishes are all your favorites," William replied, putting his phone down and serving her food.

Elisa and Raymond exchanged pleased looks.

Gabrielle, on the other hand, struggled to hide her eye-roll.

Christina's amnesia was just too convenient, solving all their problems in one fell swoop.

"Walter, I don't want such a scheming daughter-in-law. William is blinded right now, but you mustn't follow in his footsteps," she warned her son again.

To put it bluntly, even if William suffered in love, he at least had Nicholas's approval.

But Walter?

If he did the same, his outcome would be far worse than William's.

"Mom, Christina just survived a car accident. Please don't say things like that," Walter, already hurting, couldn't bear Gabrielle's sarcasm.

It felt like his heart was being cut into pieces, each one aching terribly.

Mentioning the car accident only fueled Gabrielle's prejudice. "She didn't just get herself hit; she dragged William into it too!"

If it weren't for Christina, how could William have had an accident?

Thank goodness it wasn't Walter who got hurt.

Otherwise, she'd want to kill Christina herself.

"Mom," Walter couldn't take it anymore.

Shouldn't they blame the driver at fault?

Why did they all blame Christina when she was also a victim?

"Fine, I won't say more. Just keep it in mind," Gabrielle finally stopped.

During dinner, William kept serving Christina food until her bowl was full.

She whispered to him, "Stop giving me food. I can't eat all this, and I don't want to waste it."

###chapter 138 I Won't Peek at Yours

"If you can't finish it, I can help you out," William said, half-joking, half-serious.

Christina immediately shook her head.

If they were at home, it wouldn't matter, but in front of so many relatives and elders, she couldn't let him eat her leftovers.

Even though she wasn't very hungry, Christina finished everything in her bowl.

She had to admit, the chef at the Cavendish Mansion was excellent. Every dish was a feast for the senses, and William had picked out all her favorites.

Nicholas watched them and sighed. "You've really forgotten about me now that you have a fiancée."

"Nicholas, you love shrimp. Here, I peeled these for you," William said, placing the shrimp in front of him.

Nicholas looked at the glistening shrimp and smiled. "Alright, alright, I was just kidding. You two are grown up now, it's time to get married. It's just the way of the world."

As an elder, he wanted all his children to be happy and with the ones they loved.

Even though Christina had caused a lot of trouble recently, and William had even gotten into a car accident because of her, there was something to be said about destiny in love.

William had willingly fallen for Christina. Even if Nicholas tried to separate them, it wouldn't make William give up on her.

It was better to let them be together.

"What did the doctor say about Christina's condition? Will there be any other aftereffects from her memory loss?" Nicholas asked, still concerned.

William shook his head. "No aftereffects, just waiting for the blood clot in her head to clear up."

Nicholas nodded. No aftereffects were good.

As for whether Christina would regain her memory, he agreed with William. It might be better if she didn't.

She was much quieter now, which was better than her previous antics.

Considering Christina's condition, Nicholas urged them to rest after dinner. "She needs to rest quietly with that blood clot. The room is ready for you two, so get some sleep."

"Thank you, Nicholas," Christina and William said as they headed upstairs.

Walter's eyes followed them. He noticed their tightly clasped hands and felt a pang of emotion.

If Christina were fully aware and chose William, Walter would silently give his blessing.

But Christina didn't know anything right now.

She was like a baby, only knowing what others told her. Walter desperately wanted to tell her the truth.

But he had no chance.

William was always by her side, and Gabrielle kept a close watch on him, leaving no opportunity for Walter to be alone with Christina.

Even if he did tell her, Christina might not believe him. Everyone around her was telling her she was William's fiancée.

Back in the room, Christina closed the door. She wanted to freshen up but felt awkward with William there. "Could you step out for a bit? I'll call you back in when I'm done."

"Everyone's downstairs. If I go out now, they'll ask why," William said, not budging.

Christina had to admit he had a point.

Everyone had seen them go upstairs together. If William left so soon, it would raise questions.

He couldn't exactly say she was taking a shower.

But having him stay in the room made her uncomfortable.

"Don't worry, I won't peek. Just close the bathroom door, and I won't see anything," William said, leading her to the bathroom door. "If you're really worried, I'll go to the balcony."

"Deal. You better not sneak in," Christina emphasized.

Once inside, she immediately locked the door.

Hearing the lock, William sighed.

Even if they were married, he wouldn't peek at her in the shower.

As he headed to the balcony, he heard the water running. Christina had started her shower.

William quickened his pace, closed the balcony door behind him, and lit a cigarette.

He stayed there until the balcony door opened.

"I'm done. You can come in now. It's getting cold out there," Christina said, now in her pajamas, her hair still wet, droplets falling onto her collarbone and disappearing into her clothes.

William quickly looked away and followed her inside. "You need to dry your hair completely."

"Okay," Christina said, not arguing.

Meanwhile, Jennifer was losing her mind.

Her room was a mess.

She had planned to kill Christina, but William had saved her. When she tried again, Christina only lost her memory. And now, Christina was happily with William?

How was that fair?

Especially since Nicholas no longer opposed them. What was all her effort for?

Jennifer's mother, Sophia Brown, saw her daughter's distress and felt heartbroken. "Jennifer, let go of William. If he doesn't notice you after all this, he's not the one for you. Why keep hurting yourself?"

Sophia saw Jennifer's pain and felt it deeply.

But Jennifer wouldn't listen.

"I've loved William for so many years. How can I just stop? Christina ruined everything. She deserves to die!"

Jennifer's eyes flashed with anger at the mention of Christina. She even considered confronting Christina and ending it all.

Otherwise, she couldn't let go of her hatred.

"Don't do anything foolish. Christina has people helping her. If you keep fighting her, you'll end up worse off. Jennifer, you've worked so hard for what you have. Your father did so much for you. Do you want to lose everything?" Sophia held Jennifer back, not wanting her to make more mistakes.

###chapter 139  Am I Not Better Than Her?

Jennifer wasn't having any of it.

She snapped, "You really think I'm not as good as Christina?"

"That's not what I meant," Sophia replied. In her eyes, her daughter was the best, and Christina couldn't hold a candle to Jennifer.

But what she thought didn't matter. What mattered was what William thought.

William had made it clear that he liked Christina and wanted to be with her. He had even gone to the trouble of getting Nicholas's approval.

"William's made his feelings very clear. He's set on Christina. If you keep wasting your time on him, you're only going to get hurt. I care about you, Jennifer. You're my only daughter," Sophia pleaded earnestly.

But it was no use. Jennifer wasn't listening.

"I want to be with him. I've made up my mind. You keep telling me to find someone else, but who? Can you find me another guy with the same qualities?" Jennifer challenged.

Sophia was at a loss for words.

Who could compare to William, the future heir of the Cavendish family? There wasn't an unmarried man out there who could match him.

Even if someone had a comparable background, they couldn't match his looks or age.

"Yes, he's got the best qualities, but he doesn't like you. If he did, we'd support you no matter what. Your dad and I just want you to be happy. But right now, it's all one-sided. He has no interest in you at all!"

Sophia knew her words were harsh.

But she had no choice. She couldn't let Jennifer continue down this path. It would only lead to heartbreak.

Jennifer's eyes reddened. "I'm not any less than Christina. And they're not married yet. Even if they do get married, they can still get divorced. Why are you so quick to give up on my feelings?"

Sophia didn't know what to say.

Why was her daughter so stubborn?

Jennifer was resolute. "Besides, William and I know each other. He wasn't bad to me before. I've made up my mind about him. Nothing you say will change that."

"You're going to be the death of me!" Sophia exclaimed, storming off.

Watching her mother leave, Jennifer's resolve only grew stronger.

Even if Sophia didn't support her now, once she married William, everything would fall into place.



At the Cavendish Mansion.

William helped Christina dry her hair, and then they fell asleep in each other's arms.

They both slept well that night.

But downstairs, Walter tossed and turned.

It felt like a thousand ants were crawling inside him, a mix of restlessness and pain.

He tried to clear his mind, but Christina's image kept popping up.

He had planned to take Christina away from here.

Even if it was difficult, the end result would be worth it.

But then, at the crucial moment, Christina lost her memory, giving William the perfect opportunity.

Every time he thought about it, Walter was filled with anger and frustration. How could it be so coincidental?

They both had car accidents, and everyone blamed Christina, saying she brought bad luck to William.

But Walter didn't see it that way.

He thought it might be the other way around. Maybe William brought bad luck to Christina. If he hadn't been so persistent, she would have left, and none of this would have happened.

Walter blamed William and himself. If he were the Cavendish heir, William wouldn't even be in the picture.

He barely slept that night, and at breakfast, he had dark circles under his eyes.

"Walter, what happened to you?" Gabrielle asked, worried about her son. "You used to have trouble sleeping in new places, but you got over that."

"There was a mosquito in my room last night, so I couldn't sleep," Walter lied.

He couldn't tell Gabrielle he was worried about Christina. That would cause a huge scene.

"How can there be mosquitoes this time of year?" Gabrielle was skeptical.

"It must have been in the house already. The temperature inside is higher, and mosquitoes are getting tougher," Walter explained.

Gabrielle thought about it and agreed. Everything was evolving, including mosquitoes.

"Eat your breakfast. Afterward, I'll check your room and get rid of that mosquito. Then you can take a nap this afternoon."

Just then, William and Christina came downstairs.

Nicholas emerged from his study.

Seeing their rosy faces, Nicholas felt relieved.

As long as they were happy and didn't cause any more trouble, the past didn't matter.

William had sacrificed a lot for the Cavendish family. He had to learn many things from a young age. If he had to compromise in love too, it would be too much.

"Nicholas, I'm sorry we're late. We overslept," William said.

Everyone knew William was always punctual. It was likely Christina who had slept in, and William was taking the blame to protect her.

"We're at home, not out somewhere. It doesn't matter if you're a bit late. Sit down and eat," Nicholas said, letting it slide.

During breakfast, William was attentive to Christina, getting her bread and peeling her eggs.

Christina had no memory of him, but his actions showed he was very caring.

No wonder her parents wanted them to marry soon. He seemed like a great husband.

Walter couldn't openly stare at them, so he watched them out of the corner of his eye while drinking his soup. Seeing Christina's happiness was like a knife to his heart.

It wasn't Christina's fault. She had lost her memory. But William hadn't.

He knew how much Christina had hated him, wishing he would disappear forever.

But he was deceiving her now. It was despicable.

###chapter 140  Tell the Truth

If Christina's brain hemorrhage ever clears up and she remembers everything, she's going to be livid.

Who could stand being so close to their enemy, living like a married couple?

"Walter, is the soup not to your taste?" Gabrielle noticed Walter's discomfort and quickly took the soup away. "If you don't like it, don't force yourself. You haven't been sleeping well, so don't push yourself to eat things you don't enjoy."

"The soup has onions in it, and the taste is a bit strong," Walter said, trying to come up with an excuse.

Luckily, Gabrielle bought it. "Don't eat it then. After I finish dealing with these mosquitoes, I'll make something you like and bring it to your room."

"Thanks, Mom." Walter greeted Nicholas and then moved to sit on the couch.

Everyone was deceiving Christina, and no one was telling her the truth. He couldn't just join in on the lies.

He had to tell Christina the truth today.

After dinner, William spent some time with Christina before heading to the study for a video conference.

Christina, feeling bored, decided to take a walk in the garden to help digest her food.

This was a perfect opportunity, and Walter quickly followed her.

Taking advantage of the fact that no one was around, he called out her name, "Christina, I need to talk to you."

"What do you want to talk about?" Christina turned around and smiled at him.

She looked so happy, and Walter felt tormented inside.

He knew how much Christina had suffered recently, and now that she was finally happy, he had to be the one to shatter that happiness.

He really couldn't bear it.

If Christina had permanent amnesia, he could convince himself, but that wasn't the case.

She could remember everything at any moment.

So it was better to let her know the truth sooner.

"Have you ever suspected that all of this is fake? That your relationship isn't as good as it seems, and that you actually want to leave him?" Walter hadn't even finished speaking when Christina's smile disappeared.

Her eyes scrutinized him, "That's not funny at all. He's so good to me, why would I want to leave him?"

Besides, everyone around her told her that William loved her deeply, even her parents said so.

And William acted that way too.

Of course, she believed what she saw with her own eyes. She couldn't just believe someone who suddenly appeared and said otherwise.

"He's only pretending to be good to you. He used to treat you terribly. Trust me, you need to leave now. If you wait any longer, you won't be able to leave." Walter had another concern he didn't voice.

He feared William might take advantage of the situation and deliberately get her pregnant.

After all, in everyone's eyes, they were about to get married, so a pregnancy would be seen as a joyous event.

But it wouldn't be the same for Christina.

"You're really funny. Why should I believe you?" Christina's frown deepened. "Are you saying this because of your mom, Gabrielle? Are you trying to take advantage of my amnesia and treat me like a fool?"

She knew her mom and Gabrielle never got along, always at odds with each other.

Walter, being Gabrielle's son, would naturally side with his mom, so it made sense that he wouldn't want to see her happy.

Walter's heart ached. "My mom does have a bias against you, but I'm not like that. Trust me this once, I'm the last person in the world who would hurt you."

"Then you need to show me some proof. I can't just believe you based on your words, especially when what you're saying is completely different from what I see." Christina's suspicion still dominated her thoughts.

Just as Walter was trying to find a way to prove himself, a familiar voice interrupted.

"Christina, what are you two talking about?"

It was William.

Walter's alarm bells went off. Wasn't he supposed to be in the study for a meeting? How did he come out so quickly?

Could it be that William was already on guard?

If so, it would be much harder to tell Christina the truth.

"Nothing much, we just ran into each other in the garden and chatted a bit." Christina walked over to William and naturally linked arms with him. "But what about you? Why did you leave your work to find me? Can't you be away from me for even a moment?"

She made a casual joke.

But William nodded, "A meeting can't compare to you."

"You're such a sweet talker, I don't believe you." Christina playfully scolded.

Walter's heart bled.

But there was nothing he could do now. In front of William, he couldn't say anything. This was the most excruciating torture.

"Let's go, I'll walk with you in the garden." William wanted to take her away.

Christina shook her head, "No, let's go back. I don't want you to delay your work because of me. Besides, I just came out to walk off my meal, and this is enough."

"I knew my wife was the most considerate, always thinking of me." William delivered another blow to Walter.

How dare he call Christina his wife, how dare he!

Watching them walk away, Walter's mouth filled with bitterness.

On the way back, Christina thought about what Walter had said, and she couldn't help but feel uneasy.

She wanted to ask William, "By the way, how's your relationship with Walter?"

"It's okay. We're family, so we get along on the surface, but we're not particularly close." William had suspected that Walter wanted to say something to Christina.

Now, hearing her question, he was certain his suspicion was correct.

Walter indeed had bad intentions.

"Christina, if he says anything to you, don't believe him. You can tell me, and I'll handle it."

"What could he say? We just chatted a bit. You know I can't remember anything, so I wanted to ask you first." Christina didn't believe what Walter had said.

But she couldn't just betray him immediately. She needed to find out the truth first. If Walter was lying, she could deal with him then.

William didn't ask further. As they went upstairs, they ran into Gabrielle coming down.

He said, "Christina, you go back to the room first. I need to get something."

###chapter 141  Do Not Wish for Similar Things to Happen Again

"Alright, I'm heading up," Christina said, nodding before heading straight to her room.

Once she was gone, William turned to Gabrielle with a stern look. "Keep Walter in line. I don't want a repeat of this mess."

Gabrielle looked puzzled at first.

It wasn't until she saw Walter trudging back, looking utterly defeated, and remembered that Christina had returned with William, that she pieced it together.

Her anger flared up instantly. She grabbed Walter by the arm, dragged him into the bedroom, slammed the door shut, and started yelling, "Walter, you really are something else. I felt sorry for you, so I came to your room after dinner to kill a mosquito. I turned the whole room upside down and couldn't find it. Now I realize the mosquito wasn't in the room; it was in your heart!"

She jabbed her finger hard into Walter's chest.

Even that didn't seem to vent her anger enough. "How many times do I have to tell you? My mouth is dry from talking, but you just won't listen. You insist on getting tangled up with Christina."

"Mom-"

Walter barely got a word in before she cut him off sharply.

"Don't call me Mom. I don't have a son who can't get his act together. Of all the people you could like, you choose Christina. She's doing great with William, they're about to get married. Why do you have to ruin everything?" Gabrielle had previously thought about driving Christina away.

Now she didn't want that anymore.

Christina marrying William was fine. If she married anyone else, Gabrielle feared Walter would go to any lengths to win her back.

Walter's voice was hoarse, "I didn't ruin anything. Even if I wanted to, I don't have the power."

Christina didn't trust him at all now.

The only person she trusted was that liar, William.

"William just came to warn me. He doesn't want anything like this happening again. I don't know what he was talking about, but if he said it, it can't be good. Just let me have some peace, okay?" Gabrielle was so angry she was speaking without thinking.

"Or do you want to push me to become a nun?"

At her age, with her child about to get married, becoming a nun would make her a laughingstock.

The entire Cavendish family would be shamed.

Nicholas would never allow that to happen. The whole family would be in turmoil.

Walter couldn't bear to see Gabrielle do something like that. "Mom, if I push you to that point, what kind of person would I be?"

"If you keep being stubborn and insist on getting tangled up with Christina, you're pushing me to my death. I've said all I can. Think it over. You're not a child anymore; you know what you're doing." Gabrielle was so angry she even mentioned death.

Walter was at a loss.

On one side was his mother, on the other was Christina. It felt like two ropes pulling him in opposite directions.

The pain was excruciating.

Meanwhile, in Christina's room...

She had been there for a while when William came in with a plate of fruit, all peeled and cut. "My online meeting isn't over yet. I'll join you in a bit. Have some fruit first."

"You didn't pause the meeting just to bring me this, did you?" Christina asked, surprised. "What did the others say?"

William chuckled at her reaction. "Today's meeting is long. We were on a break."

"Oh, got it. Go finish your meeting. I won't disturb you. I'll be quiet as a mouse," Christina said, putting on her headphones.

She sat on the bed, eating fruit and watching a show. The scene was so peaceful.

William felt a deep sense of happiness.

He would always treat Christina well and cherish these moments.

During the meeting, his voice softened, becoming much gentler than before.

The participants noticed that William was unusually easygoing today. Even if something wasn't perfect, he just gave a few simple instructions to complete the work, without any criticism.

They didn't know why, but they all hoped William would always be like this.

After the meeting, William immediately put down his phone and went to Christina's side.

"You finished quickly. I barely watched an episode," Christina said, taking off her headphones.

They were so close, they could see only each other in their eyes.

William suddenly wanted to see her in a wedding dress. "Christina, if you don't have any plans these days, let's go pick out a wedding dress and rings."

"Getting married is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. It's the most important. Even if I had other plans, I'd put the wedding first," Christina said seriously.

Besides, she had never worn a wedding dress before, only seen models in videos.

They were so beautiful.

"Let's go tomorrow then. We'll try on dresses first. Pick your favorite brand, and we'll go there. We'll choose the rings the day after. I don't want to tire you out," William said, worried about her health.

Christina agreed, "But for something this important, I need to discuss it with my parents and get their opinions."

She put on her slippers and got out of bed, then turned to ask, "Should we ask Nicholas too?"

"Nicholas won't care about such small things. It's your opinion that matters. This is our wedding. Your preferences are the most important," William said, tucking a stray hair behind her ear and kissing her forehead.

He wanted to make Christina happy more than pleasing the family.

He wanted her to have the final say in all the wedding details. As long as she was happy, that was all that mattered.

Christina felt a warm rush in her heart. William was so good to her.

But what about what Walter had said...

Maybe he just couldn't stand seeing them so happy and wanted to ruin it.

Never mind, she thought. She'd focus on picking out the wedding dress first.

She went to find Elisa and told her that she and William were going to pick out a wedding dress tomorrow. Elisa was thrilled. "I'll go with you."

###chapter 142  Let's Get the Marriage Certificate Tomorrow

Christina had no objections, of course.

For such a big event like a wedding, having more people to help was definitely a good thing.

But just as she agreed, Elisa changed her mind. "No, I shouldn't go. You young folks have your own tastes and styles. If I tag along, wouldn't that be a bit much?"

"Mom, how can you say that?" Christina had never thought that way.

"You're my mother, William's future mother-in-law. It's only natural for you to come with us to pick out the wedding dress and give some suggestions. How could we ever feel bothered by that?"

It's not like they were the only family doing this. When others get married and pick out wedding dresses, they also bring along both sets of parents to help with opinions.

Elisa held her hand. "Others are others, and you are you. We don't have to compare ourselves to others. As long as you two are happy, that's all that matters to me."

"By the way, Mom, I wanted to ask you something. You mentioned before that our family doesn't get along well with Gabrielle's. Did I know Walter before?" Christina decided to probe Elisa's attitude a bit more.

Elisa's pupils contracted slightly.

A sense of caution rose in her heart. Why was Christina suddenly asking this? Had she remembered something?

But that shouldn't be possible. It had only been a few days, and the blood clot in her brain hadn't dissipated yet. She shouldn't have regained her memory.

Besides, Elisa knew Christina's personality very well. If Christina had really regained her memory, she would have caused a huge commotion, making the whole family restless. She wouldn't be this calm.

So she must be asking casually.

Understanding this, Elisa smiled. "Of course, you two know each other. You just had a bit of a falling out before."

"What happened?" Christina was puzzled.

According to Elisa, her relationship with Walter wasn't great. But when Walter spoke to her earlier, it seemed like he was just trying to stir up trouble.

Yet, in the garden today, she saw genuine concern in his eyes.

This stark contrast was what puzzled her the most.

"You know Gabrielle and I have never gotten along. Especially after you and William got together, Gabrielle would seize any chance to be sarcastic. Walter naturally wasn't much better. You two even had a fight before, but that's all in the past now," Elisa made up a story.

Christina wanted to ask more, but Elisa didn't want to continue.

She stood up, took a bracelet from a drawer, and put it on Christina's wrist. "Your current task is to prepare for the wedding and marry William in style. Everything else can wait, understand?"

Christina nodded.

It made sense. She couldn't just call off the wedding because of something someone said.

"Go back to your room and rest. Get to bed early tonight. We have to leave early tomorrow. Remember to dress warmly so you don't catch a cold," Elisa advised her carefully before accompanying Christina back.

With nothing else to do, Christina opened her phone and browsed various wedding dress brands, finally settling on a high-end one.

Their dresses were known for their luxurious style, with large trailing skirts and intricate designs. The more Christina looked, the more she liked them.

When William came back from work, she showed him her phone. "William, what do you think of these wedding dresses?"

"They're beautiful and perfect for you. You have such a slim waist; you'll look stunning in a wedding dress," William said, already eager to see her in one.

But it was too late tonight, and the bridal shop was closed. He didn't want to tire Christina out either.

They would go tomorrow.

Christina smiled. "I think these dresses are the best. How about we try this shop first tomorrow? Or do you have a style you like? We can try them all."

"Anything you wear will look great. Let's just go to this shop," William said, his throat tightening as he looked at her.

How had he not noticed how wonderful Christina was before?

But it wasn't too late. Soon, Christina would be his wife, and they would be together forever, always happy.

He would never let her dreams turn into nightmares, nor would he let them become enemies.

"If you only say that one line when we get to the bridal shop tomorrow, I'll have to hit you," Christina playfully waved a fist at him. "I need you to help me make decisions. If you just agree with everything I say, why do I need you there?"

With so many dresses in the shop, she would definitely be overwhelmed. She needed someone to help her choose the best one.

William's smile deepened. "You're right, honey. I'll make sure to be more helpful."

"Don't call me that. We're not married yet. It's too soon to call me that," Christina's face turned red.

She gently pushed him away.

She didn't use much force, and since William didn't want to move, he stayed put.

He even held her hand, pretending to be confused. "Is there a problem with calling you that? We're engaged and about to get married. Tomorrow we'll pick out the dress. If I don't call you 'honey,' what should I call you?"

Husbands and wives should call each other that.

It wouldn't make sense for them to be married and still call each other by their first names. That would be too distant.

Christina admitted he had a point, but, "We're not married yet. Calling me 'honey' now is too soon. At least wait until we have the marriage certificate."

William seemed to ponder this.

"You're right. How about we pick out the dress and get the marriage certificate tomorrow?"

He had wanted to get the marriage certificate with Christina for a long time.

Even if they had a wedding, they wouldn't be legally married without it.

He wanted to be with Christina and didn't want her to leave. The marriage certificate was essential.

"What?" Christina thought he was joking at first, but he looked serious.

She quickly shook her head. "I think we should just pick out the dress tomorrow. Getting the marriage certificate now is too soon. I'm not ready yet. Let's wait until after the wedding."

###chapter 143  Unfair to Everyone

"Christina, do you not want to marry me?" William asked, looking straight into her eyes. "Is it because of Walter?"

Christina admitted that Walter's words had definitely made her uneasy.

But she stood her ground. Calling off the wedding and worrying everyone in the family over this was something she couldn't do. "Of course not. If I didn't want to get married, why would I be looking at wedding dresses just now? I just think it's a bit too soon to get married. This is a big deal, and I still can't remember anything."

She didn't want to marry him while she was still so confused.

At least, not until she got better.

"But Christina, the wedding is already being planned. Our families want us to settle down soon, and you agreed to the reception. We're even living together now. Is it really that important to regain your memory?" William continued to persuade her.

"No one knows when you'll remember. It could be tonight, tomorrow, or maybe never. How long do you want me to wait?"

This question stumped Christina.

She couldn't answer.

Even the doctors couldn't give a definite timeline, so how could she know?

Making William wait because of her was indeed unfair to him.

He was so invested in the wedding and treated her so well. She couldn't just trample on his feelings.

Before Christina could figure out what to do, William spoke again, "I understand your concerns. How about this? We won't get married tomorrow. If you still can't remember by the eve of the wedding, we'll go get the marriage certificate then. Does that work?"

"Of course," Christina agreed without hesitation.

Seeing the anticipation in William's eyes, she felt even more guilty. "I'm sorry, I was being unreasonable about this. Thank you for putting up with me."

He really was so good to her, never demanding anything and always being so considerate, putting her first in everything.

"How can this be unreasonable? It's natural to have concerns. I'm your husband. If I can't understand you, that would be too much." William ruffled her hair. "Get some rest. I have a meeting to attend."

Christina nodded.

William had planned to hold the video conference in the bedroom, but after thinking it over, he took his laptop to the study next door.

Even though he would use headphones during the meeting, there would still be some noise, and the desk lamp would be on, which might disturb Christina's rest.

With ten minutes left before the meeting, William sat at the desk and opened his laptop, but his mind wandered back to the bedroom.

Christina should be asleep by now.

She apologized today, but the one who should really be sorry was him.

He knew Christina had amnesia, yet he took advantage of the situation. It was unfair to her.

But was it fair to him that Christina, based on a baseless dream, saw him as a villain, held such a grudge, and even wanted to kill him?

He hadn't done anything wrong or hurt her. He shouldn't bear such a heavy accusation.

This was a chance for them to get along better.

The next morning, Christina got up early.

Since they were going to pick out a wedding dress, she put on light makeup. As she was changing, the bedroom door opened.

She jumped, "Who's there?"

"It's me, Christina. I brought you breakfast," William's voice came through.

She breathed a sigh of relief.

Thank goodness it was him and not someone else.

"I'll eat in a bit. Just wait a moment and don't come in," Christina said as she hurriedly dressed.

In her rush, she fumbled, and standing on one foot, she almost fell.

She quickly grabbed the clothes, trying to steady herself.

But the clothes rack came down with a loud crash.

William's heart skipped a beat, "Christina, what happened?"

"Nothing, just don't come in... Ah!"

William didn't hesitate. He put the breakfast on the table and rushed in.

He caught Christina by the waist from behind, steadying her before letting go. "Be careful. I don't want you getting hurt again and having to go to the hospital today."

It wasn't that he minded the extra trip; he just didn't want to see her hurt again.

When Christina had her car accident, she was so badly injured. He had silently vowed to protect her and never let anything like that happen again.

"I know. I just lost my balance for a moment," Christina said, realizing she was half-dressed.

And they were so close.

Embarrassed, she pushed him away, "Get out!"

"It's hard to zip up alone. Want me to help?"

"No, I can do it myself. Don't peek," Christina quickly pulled the closet curtain closed.

William stood outside, listening to the sounds inside, recalling Christina's earlier appearance, and couldn't help but chuckle.

"Why are you laughing at me?" Christina's face turned even redder. "Stop laughing."

"Okay, I won't laugh. How could I dare laugh at you, my dear wife?" William stopped making noise, but his eyes were full of amusement.

This side of Christina was so charming.

Her shyness was adorable.

Soon, Christina came out, dressed, and twirled in front of him. "How do I look in this dress?"

"You look beautiful. Let's eat, and then we should go. Otherwise, I might not be able to resist staying in the bedroom with you," William said, taking her hand.

He was a normal man, and of course, he had physical desires for the woman he loved.

Christina lightly kicked him, "Can you be serious in broad daylight?"

Though they had been sleeping together, they were still in their pajamas and hadn't seen each other naked.

After breakfast, William drove her to the biggest mall, and they headed straight to the bridal shop.

The staff, seeing their distinguished demeanor and the expensive watch on William's wrist, were incredibly enthusiastic.

###chapter 144 Do Not Leave Me

"Hey, follow me to the VIP room. I'll show you some wedding dresses based on what you like, and then you can try them on," the store assistant said.

"Sounds good," Christina replied, holding onto William's arm as they walked in.

As soon as they sat down, the assistant brought over drinks and snacks.

"I want something a bit more glamorous. I saw some beautiful mermaid styles and long trains on your website," Christina said, having watched numerous videos the night before.

But no matter how many videos she watched online, nothing could compare to trying them on in person.

Through their conversation, the assistant quickly realized that Christina was the decision-maker, while William just wanted her to be happy. So, she directed all her suggestions to Christina. "Ms. Windsor, I've picked out a few dresses based on what you like. Take a look, and if you like any, we can try them on. Many dresses look different when worn."

"Let's start with these three," Christina chose her favorites.

While Christina tried on the dresses, William waited outside. The process of trying on wedding dresses is always lengthy, and the wait felt endless. He had no idea how long he had been waiting when the assistant finally came out and drew back the curtain.

At that moment, Christina turned around.

William experienced what it truly meant to fall in love at first sight. He was completely mesmerized until Christina walked up to him, snapping him out of his daze. "You look stunning," he said.

"Ms. Windsor is wearing light makeup today. She'll look even more beautiful on the wedding day with her bridal makeup," the assistant chimed in, showering her with compliments.

Having worked in the bridal shop for so long and seeing countless brides, the assistant could confidently say that Christina was one of the most beautiful brides she had ever seen. And William was undoubtedly the most handsome groom.

Together, they perfectly embodied the phrase "a match made in heaven."

"Wait a bit longer while I try on the other two dresses," Christina said, heading back to the fitting room with the assistant's help.

She gave William two more delightful surprises with the other dresses.

When it came time to choose, William was at a loss. "I'm not trying to be evasive, but you look amazing in all three dresses. I really can't decide."

"I'm torn too. I can only wear one on the wedding day. I can't exactly switch between all three," Christina said, feeling reluctant to let any of them go.

The assistant offered a suggestion, "Have you planned your wedding reception yet? You could choose a dress that matches the style of your reception."

This question stumped Christina.

She shook her head, "We haven't had time to plan the reception yet."

"I've already prepared several design concepts. I was planning to show them to you tonight," William said, pulling out his phone to show Christina the designs sent by their designer.

Just from the pictures, Christina could tell the reception would be incredibly luxurious.

William truly wanted to give her the best of everything. Every detail in the designs was so exquisite.

"Let's go with the first one. I love the bouquets," Christina quickly made her choice.

After some discussion, they decided on the mermaid-style dress, which accentuated her figure beautifully.

When it was time to sign the contract, the assistant asked, "Would you like to rent or buy the wedding dress? We have affordable rental packages, but if you buy, it will be custom-made to fit you perfectly, though it is more expensive."

Christina felt a bit conflicted.

She wanted to wear a new, custom-made dress on her wedding day, but wedding dresses are only worn once. The one she chose was intricate and would be difficult to maintain and store.

William didn't give her a chance to worry. "We'll go with custom-made. Money isn't an issue. I want everything to be perfect, including the reception dress and the going-away outfit."

"Alright, I'll prepare the contract. If everything looks good, you can pay the deposit today, and we'll take your measurements to start the custom process," the assistant said, heading off to get the contract.

Now alone in the VIP room, Christina couldn't help but ask, "I know you have money, but isn't this a bit extravagant? Renting would be just as good. You saw how well the dresses fit."

"I don't want any regrets on our wedding day, not even the smallest one," William smiled. "And I think you underestimate your husband's financial capabilities."

He could afford to custom-make every dress in the store if Christina wanted. In fact, he could go even further.

"Why don't you look up the Cavendish Corporation's market value?" he suggested.

"Sure, I'll check," Christina said, opening her browser.

Her eyes widened at the search results. It was an astronomical amount.

She had thought the Cavendish Mansion was overly luxurious, but now she felt it could be even more opulent.

"After we get married, I'll transfer some of my shares to you. You'll be a wealthy woman. Buy whatever you want without worrying about the price," William said, playfully tapping her nose.

He was always generous with his wife. If he hadn't fully accepted her, he wouldn't have agreed to marry her. Now that they were getting married, it meant he was completely committed to Christina.

Everything he had was hers, including his wealth.

"You're so good to me. Aren't you afraid I'll take your money and run?" Christina teased. "I could move abroad, far away from you, and you'd never find me."

William immediately thought of how determined Christina had been to run away before. He pulled her into a tight embrace. "Don't say that. You won't leave me, right?"

"You're so good to me. I'm happy with you. Why would I leave? I wouldn't do that to myself," Christina reassured him. "I was just joking. Don't take it to heart."

William understood, but he couldn't shake a lingering worry.

###chapter 145 Go Treat Your Illness

The past few days had been a dream for him, a taste of a life he never wanted to let go of.

Naturally, he kept these thoughts to himself, not sharing them with anyone.

Soon, the store clerk came back with the prepared contract. This time, Christina didn't hesitate and signed her name right away.

William swiped his card to pay.

The clerk then led Christina to a back room to take detailed measurements. "Ms. Windsor, once the wedding dress is ready, it will be shipped from overseas to our store. I'll notify you to come in for a fitting. If there are any issues, we can send it back for adjustments."

"Will that delay things a lot?" Christina asked, a bit worried.

If the wedding date was far off, it wouldn't matter, but if it was soon and the dress got stuck in transit, she'd be disappointed.

She had already chosen her dream dress and didn't want to settle for anything less.

"Ms. Windsor, the dress is custom-made based on today's measurements. If your body doesn't change, it will fit perfectly. If you gain or lose weight, adjustments can be made quickly. We use air shipping, so it won't get stuck in transit," the clerk explained patiently.

Christina felt reassured.

After leaving the bridal shop, she checked the time. "I didn't expect the dress fitting to go so smoothly. It's still early. How about we look at wedding rings too?"

It would be great to get everything done in one trip, saving them from having to come back tomorrow.

She had plenty of time, but William was always busy.

"Sure," William agreed, wrapping his arm around her waist. They looked like a couple deeply in love.

There was a large jewelry store downstairs. The air conditioning was strong, and Christina felt a bit cold when they walked in.

She wanted a hot coffee but felt too shy to ask.

"What's wrong?" William noticed her discomfort. "If you're tired, we can go home and rest. We can look at rings tomorrow."

Christina shook her head. "I'm not tired, just a bit thirsty. Let's finish picking out the rings first."

"I'll get you a coffee. Three sugars, warm, right?" William knew her favorite order.

Christina nodded, feeling understood.

While William went to get coffee, Christina browsed the rings alone. She was quickly drawn to the store's centerpiece. "Can I see this ring?"

"Of course, ma'am. This is the only 'Cupid's Kiss' in the country, symbolizing eternal love," the clerk said, carefully letting Christina try it on.

Just then, Jennifer walked by outside.

She saw Christina inside and her smile vanished.

What was Christina doing in a jewelry store?

Was she trying to force William into marriage?

Jennifer stormed in, standing behind Christina, her jealousy almost palpable.

William should be her husband, and that ring should be hers.

Why did Christina get everything?

"Ma'am, your fingers are perfect for jewelry. This ring also has a matching necklace and earrings. It's pricey, but worth it."

"Price isn't an issue. Show me the matching men's ring," Christina said, knowing William's worth.

They had money, so there was no need to be frugal about their wedding.

Jennifer couldn't take it anymore.

She slapped Christina's hand away and pointed at her. "You're shameless!"

"Who are you?" Christina had no idea who she was.

To Christina, she was just a stranger causing a scene.

"If you're sick, take your meds. If that doesn't work, get hospitalized. Don't come out here acting crazy."

The clerk also looked at Jennifer disapprovingly. "Ma'am, our rings are very valuable. If you damage anything, you'll have to pay for it."

Jennifer, already consumed by jealousy, exploded.

"Who do you think you are, a mere clerk? I can afford a ring, and I don't need to beg a man to buy it for me!"

Christina knew this was aimed at her.

She wouldn't take it lying down. "If you can afford it, buy it now. Once it's yours, do what you want with it. As for me, my husband is happy to spend money on me. It's mutual. None of your business."

The word "husband" was like a knife to Jennifer's heart.

She dreamed of walking down the aisle in a white dress to William, of being called his wife.

Why Christina?

"Do you really think William loves you? He can't stand you! If you weren't so shamelessly clinging to him, he'd never be with you. You think forcing him into marriage will make you Mrs. Cavendish? It's all a fantasy!"

Jennifer's voice grew louder.

The clerks exchanged looks, ready to call security to remove her.

Christina initially thought Jennifer was just crazy, but something felt off.

It seemed like Jennifer knew William.

"If he doesn't like me, who does he like? You?" Christina asked, genuinely curious. "If so, why didn't he marry you?"

She couldn't understand it.

William was the Cavendish heir, influential in his family, not someone who just followed orders.

He had his own mind and wouldn't just go along with things.

If he didn't like her, why pretend to love her?

"Because..."

"Jennifer." A threatening voice interrupted.

William was back with the coffee.

He handed it to Christina. "It's still a bit hot. Drink it slowly."

His warmth vanished when he turned to Jennifer, replaced by coldness.

###chapter 146 She Is Just Unwilling

"You've really crossed the line this time."

"William!" Jennifer's tears streamed down her face, her heart breaking.

She loved him so much. Couldn't he see that?

Not only did he ignore her feelings, but now he was also scolding her for Christina's sake.

Was Christina really that amazing?

"She picked the priciest diamond ring in the store without even flinching. She didn't think about you at all."

Christina, standing nearby, rolled her eyes. "Seriously, you don't need to worry about my husband. Besides, it's not like I can't afford it. We've got the money."

Was she supposed to save money just because she had it, and then hand over the savings to another woman?

A hint of a smile appeared in William's eyes. "I make money for you to spend, Christina. Buy whatever you want. No need to hold back. If you have to check the price before buying something, then I'm failing as a husband."

He made his stance crystal clear.

He didn't care how much Christina spent, nor did he need her to save. It was all his choice.

"William." Jennifer felt like she was about to pass out from the pain.

She wanted to say more, but William had already laid down the law. "Family is my bottom line. Christina is my fiancée, and we're getting married soon. I don't want to hear any insults about her from anyone, and you better not cross my line."

Otherwise, he wouldn't show Jennifer any mercy.

"Miss, please leave our store immediately. We've already notified security, and they'll be here soon," the store clerk added.

With so many people in the mall, if she was escorted out by security, it would be utterly humiliating.

She might even be recorded and become a laughingstock online.

Jennifer had her pride and couldn't accept such a thing. But leaving like this felt too unfair.

"What is your relationship with her? Is she your ex-girlfriend?" Christina frowned at the thought.

If so, his taste wasn't great.

How could he have been interested in such an uncouth woman?

"Of course not. We're just friends, but it seems we can't even be that anymore." William focused all his attention on comforting Christina.

Jennifer watched them being affectionate while she was kicked out by the store clerk.

To prevent her from causing trouble, the clerk even closed the door.

The transparent glass door kept her out but didn't block her view.

"Sorry for the disturbance earlier. It was our store's mismanagement. If you decide to purchase this wedding ring, I'll apply for a discount for you," the clerk continued to serve them enthusiastically.

If the clerk could sell this wedding ring, her commission would be substantial, enough to live on for a year.

Christina helped him put on the men's ring, admiring how good it looked. "I really like it. What do you think?"

"Let's go with this one, along with the matching necklace and earrings. They'll go perfectly with the wedding dress we just picked out." William took out his card and paid without hesitation.

He didn't mind spending money on Christina at all.

Jennifer didn't even know how she managed to leave the mall. Her vision was blurred with tears, and every step felt like agony.

Back home, she locked herself in her room, refusing to eat or drink.

Eventually, Sophia, worried sick about her, forced the door open. Seeing Jennifer lying on the bed, she was both angry and heartbroken. "Who are you punishing? If you ruin your health, who will care? You're just hurting your parents."

In the end, her parents were the ones who cared the most.

"They're getting married. They even bought the ring. She picked the biggest diamond in the store." Jennifer's tears had almost dried up.

Sophia was exasperated. "So what if it's the most expensive ring? It's his money, and he wants to spend it on Christina. Why can't you just let it go?"

They had never wronged Jennifer growing up. Maybe they spoiled her too much, making her feel entitled, always wanting what she couldn't have.

"But I can't accept it. I have to try everything before giving up." Jennifer was determined. "Leave me alone."

Sophia couldn't just leave her like that.

She tried to persuade her, "At least eat something, or you'll hurt yourself."

"I told you to leave. I'll eat when I'm hungry. Don't worry about me." Jennifer threw a pillow at her.

Sophia sighed and left.

After she left, Jennifer sat on the bed, her mind racing, thinking of ways to deal with Christina.

Suddenly, she thought of someone.

Some things she couldn't do alone, but with an accomplice, it would be much easier. Even if things went wrong, she could push the blame onto someone else.

Jennifer quickly changed and went downstairs. Sophia thought she had come to her senses and was going out, not knowing she was heading down the wrong path.

Half an hour later, Jennifer drove to Emerald Lakeside. The buildings here were old and dilapidated, with shared bathrooms for several households.

She walked on the muddy path, feeling disgusted by everything.

Soon, she reached the end of a narrow alley and pushed the door open.

"Jennifer? What are you doing here?" Missy put down her bucket, unable to believe her eyes.

Jennifer looked at her shabby clothes with disdain. "Do you live here every day?"

Missy nodded uneasily.

She knew the environment was bad, but the rent was the cheapest, and her family couldn't afford anything better.

When you're poor, you don't even have the right to choose.

"I can give you money." Jennifer knew what she needed most and got straight to the point. "As long as you do what I say, you won't have to live here anymore or wear such shabby clothes. You can buy all the designer bags you want."

Missy was tempted.

But Jennifer wouldn't give her money for nothing; there were conditions.

"We have the same goal. Don't you hate Christina? She made your life miserable before." Jennifer continued to persuade.

Missy finally agreed.

They discussed their plan for over an hour before Jennifer drove away from Emerald Lakeside.

###chapter 147  Obtaining the Marriage Certificate

William felt an urgency to get their marriage license sorted out as soon as possible.

So, as soon as they left the mall, he brought it up to Christina.

"Hey, since we have some time today, why don't we go get our marriage license? We can figure out the wedding details later."

Once they had the marriage license, Christina would be his wife. Even if she regained her memory, it wouldn't matter-they'd already be married.

Christina didn't respond immediately. She instinctively glanced at William.

William, tall and gentle, looked at her with a soft expression.

Even though she couldn't remember the past, William was right there with her.

They had looked at wedding dresses and rings, and were even planning the wedding.

He had even mentioned their parents.

If she only considered the present... Christina nodded. "Okay."

Walter had mentioned some unpleasant things, but William had always been good to her, and even her own mother had never objected.

Some details just couldn't be faked.

Soon, Bob drove them to City Hall.

City Hall gave them VIP treatment, and they were done in about ten minutes.

Holding the marriage license in his hand, William still felt a bit unreal.

Christina glanced at it.

In the photo, she and William were standing close together. Even the staff member commented, "Mr. Cavendish, Mrs. Cavendish, you two make a perfect couple."

"What kind of wedding do you want?" William asked, holding Christina as they walked out.

Christina, having lost some of her memory, didn't have a clear idea about weddings.

"I don't really know how it's usually done. You can handle it. I trust you."

William was thinking of having the wedding abroad.

Given their status, a big wedding could attract unwanted attention and rumors, especially since Christina had lost her memory. Those rumors could affect her.

"Once I'm done with this busy period, we'll have the wedding abroad. We'll take lots of photos and make it a memorable trip."

"Okay."

Christina nodded, and William had Bob drive them home.

Jennifer found out about their marriage license two hours later.

She was furious and wanted to tear Christina apart.

She immediately made a call. "I don't care what you have to do, but you must get rid of Christina. I can't wait any longer! Even if it means taking her down with me!"

Jennifer had initially targeted William to make it easier for her to become his wife, but what had it turned into?

She hadn't expected Christina to end up with William, having a relationship with him.

Christina had turned the tables, causing a huge commotion.

She had even managed to make William see her in a new light and remember her.

Now they had successfully gone to City Hall and become a married couple. Jennifer was filled with hatred and resentment.

She had known William first, so how had it come to this?

William had promised her that he wouldn't let anyone bully her and that he would help her achieve what she wanted. But what had it turned into?

Jennifer was hysterical, but the person on the other end of the line tried to make her see reason. "William tolerated you before because you saved him. But after you were exposed several times, do you really think you can survive if Christina dies now?"

William had taken Christina to City Hall for a marriage license, showing how much he cared for her. He was willing to do anything to be with Christina.

They hadn't even gotten through their honeymoon period yet. If Christina died, William would go berserk.

But Jennifer didn't care. "Even if I die with Christina, I can't stand seeing William with her. How can this be?"

Christina's status was so low, and William had despised her despicable behavior. But in the end, he married her.

"Why not? Even if William doesn't end up with Christina, he could be with someone else. And if you die, can you see what happens after?"

"I don't care who William ends up with, but I can't let him be with Christina!"

That was Jennifer's only thought now.

"You need to calm down!"

With that, the other person hung up.

How could Jennifer calm down?

But now, William was with Christina, and she received a text message: [Christina is with William now. You can't touch her. Even if you don't care about yourself, think about your parents.]

William was a vengeful person. Even if Jennifer died, he would go after her family. And he wouldn't let Jennifer die easily.

Jennifer tried to find William, but she had no chance. She had to come up with a long-term plan.

Meanwhile, with William...

When he brought Christina back to the villa, she didn't feel well. She was nauseous, wanted to vomit, and felt weak.

Seeing Christina like this, William immediately called Joseph.

Joseph arrived with his medical kit. Before coming, he had considered food poisoning or a cold, but he hadn't expected... Christina was pregnant!

"Congratulations, you're going to be a father."

Joseph observed William's reaction, seeing him go from shock to joy. William held Christina's shoulders, trembling with excitement.

"Christina, we're having a baby!"

William's voice was filled with emotion.

Christina was stunned. She hadn't expected to be carrying William's child.

Marrying William had indeed been the right choice.

Before this, William must have been with her for a long time. Otherwise, how could she be pregnant with his child, and why would William be so happy?

Instinctively, upon hearing she was pregnant, she touched her belly.

"How can we ease the nausea from pregnancy?"

William immediately turned to Joseph.

It was his first time becoming a father, and he had no idea how to handle these symptoms. He could only ask Joseph, the doctor.

Joseph rolled his eyes. "It's a normal pregnancy reaction. There's no way to ease it. The symptoms should lessen after three months, but some people experience them until the end of the pregnancy."

Hearing this, William looked worriedly at Christina. He didn't want her to suffer.

But Joseph added, "Pregnancy symptoms aren't something you can just wish away."

###chapter 148 Harper is Still Ranked First

Christina felt it was time to leave. "You guys keep talking, I'm gonna lie down for a bit. I'm feeling kinda tired."

"Take Mrs. Cavendish upstairs," William told a servant as soon as he saw Christina heading for the stairs.

The servant followed Christina, leaving William and Joseph alone in the living room.

Joseph had seen Christina's temper and the complicated relationship between her and William.

"So, what are you gonna do now that she's pregnant?" Joseph asked, his voice low and serious.

William replied quietly, "I've already married her. Once I wrap things up here, I'll take her somewhere nice for the wedding ceremony."

Joseph's eyes widened in disbelief. "You two are already married?"

"Yeah," William confirmed. He had taken Christina to pick out wedding rings and a dress, and with Nicholas no longer opposing their relationship, he had gone ahead and married her.

"Well, I guess congrats are in order, both for the marriage and the baby," Joseph said, though he still had his reservations. After all, William and Christina were now legally married.

William, however, had his concerns. "We've been using contraception all along. Could that affect the baby?"

"Not all contraceptives are foolproof. Regular check-ups will help catch any issues early," Joseph advised, though his words did little to ease William's worries. "If there are problems..."

"If there are problems, we can't keep the baby. Some conditions are untreatable. It might seem cruel, but keeping a child with severe issues would be irresponsible."

William understood. Joseph patted his shoulder. "Good luck to you both."

If William and Christina could live happily ever after, that would be ideal. But William knew Christina would eventually regain her memory. By then, they would be married, and she would be carrying his child. She wouldn't terminate the pregnancy.

"What kind of supplements should she take?" William asked as Joseph was about to leave.

"I'm not an obstetrician. You should go to the hospital tomorrow. Actually, I'll have someone bring them to you," Joseph offered.

"Thanks," William said, watching Joseph leave before heading upstairs to the bedroom.

Christina lay on the bed, feeling uncomfortable. William lay beside her, wrapping his arms around her from behind. "Joseph said he'll send over some supplements for you."

"What kind of supplements?" Christina asked reflexively. Even with her memory loss, she knew pregnant women should avoid certain medications.

William chuckled at her reaction. "Not medicine, just some vitamins to help with your pregnancy."

He was relieved she had lost her memory. If she hadn't, she might not have kept the baby. This also showed that deep down, Christina wanted to keep the child.

"I thought you didn't want this baby..." Christina said, seeing William's joy at the news of her pregnancy. She had feared he might not want the child when he mentioned supplements.

William kissed her forehead. "Silly, what are you thinking? I took you to pick out wedding rings and a dress. Of course, I want this baby."

"I have high hopes for our child," he added gently.

Christina suddenly asked, "What should we name our baby?"

William gave her the choice. "What do you want to name the baby?"

Christina thought for a moment. "How about Eloise Cavendish, with Harper as a nickname?"

William was stunned. Harper was the name Christina always mentioned-their daughter. In her heart, Harper was always number one.

William didn't know how to feel. Christina, too, felt uneasy. The name was so familiar, and she even had a fleeting image of a little girl in her mind, but she couldn't grasp it. It gave her a headache.

"I don't feel well. If you don't like the name, you can choose another. I need to sleep," she said, turning away.

William patted her shoulder, feeling her pain. He wondered if Christina's condition was due to some past life experience. But he dismissed the thought as unrealistic.

Christina fell asleep, and William went to his study to work.

For over two weeks, William was busy with work, and Christina stayed home. She took the vitamins Joseph sent, went for walks, and was always accompanied by a servant to ensure her safety.

Elisa visited, asking about their progress. Christina told her everything, and Elisa was relieved. As long as Christina remained Mrs. Cavendish, William wouldn't mistreat her. Elisa could die content knowing that.

Elisa's hope for Christina and William to be together was clear. "Don't think too much. Rest well. You're his wife now, and you're carrying his child. You should be together," Elisa said, cutting Christina off before she could say more.

After Elisa left, Christina felt restless. She decided to change her clothes but accidentally hit her head while adjusting the water temperature. The pain triggered memories of her past and present lives...

###chapter 149 Despicable Villain

Memories swirled in Christina's mind, and she felt utterly ridiculous.

She had just wanted to take a shower and change her clothes, but instead, she remembered everything...

Both of her lives had been a struggle because of William, and now, even after losing her memory, she had ended up marrying him.

The commotion drew William to the door, and he knocked.

"Christina, you okay in there?"

Christina snapped back to reality. What should she do now?

The knocking grew more insistent.

"Christina, answer me! I'm coming in!"

Hearing this, Christina finally came to her senses.

"I'm fine."

After freshening up, she left the room.

William approached her with concern, placing a large hand on her shoulder and pulling her into his arms. "You sure you're okay? You look really pale."

Christina coldly brushed his hand away and dried her hair with a towel.

"How long were you planning to deceive me?"

"What?" William's body tensed.

Christina glared at him, her eyes filled with hatred. "William, you liar. Did you think that by marrying me while I had amnesia, we could maintain this facade? Dream on!"

"You remembered so quickly?" William pressed his lips together.

Christina let out a cold laugh, stepping closer with each word. "Did you think I would never remember? Were you planning to deceive me forever? William, you're a despicable man!"

William suddenly stepped forward and hugged her tightly.

"Christina, you have to believe me. I didn't do it to deceive you. Please, calm down."

Christina struggled wildly, pushing him away. "William, after learning everything, how can you lie to me so easily? I'd rather never see you again."

Her last words truly hurt William. He raised his hand to stop her but didn't know what to say.

Seeing his expression, Christina grew even angrier. "I've made myself clear. This marriage means nothing to me. When are we getting a divorce?"

William hadn't expected that their sweet moments would turn into a nightmare once she remembered the past.

"Christina, I won't divorce you," William said firmly.

Christina sneered, lifting her chin. "Marrying me while I had amnesia won't be recognized by the law. No matter the cost, I will divorce you!"

With that, she turned and left the bedroom.

William chased after her, grabbing her wrist.

"Where are you going?"

"Every moment with you suffocates me. I won't stay here, William. If you force me to, you'd better sleep with one eye open, or I'll kill you."

Christina's icy words made William take a step back.

Ignoring him, she packed her things and left.

William watched her determined figure, feeling a pain like a knife in his heart.

He had known this day would come, but he hadn't expected it to be so sudden and overwhelming.

Christina moved back to her apartment and consulted a lawyer about the divorce.

The lawyer listened patiently and then offered professional advice. "If he doesn't agree, the court likely won't grant a quick divorce. There's a cooling-off period, which can be lengthy. If you're in a hurry, it's best to negotiate privately rather than go through legal channels."

Christina bit her lip. "Our marriage happened while I had amnesia. Can I sue him for fraud and have the marriage annulled?"

"That's tricky. You did go to get the marriage certificate yourself," the lawyer said, spreading his hands.

Christina felt bitter and hated William even more.

He had appeared in her life out of nowhere, seemingly to ruin it.

After thinking for a long time, she smiled faintly. "Thank you."

She paid the lawyer's fee.

At that moment, a man sat down in front of the lawyer.

"What did that lady consult you about?"

"Sorry," the lawyer shrugged. "We protect our clients' privacy."

"Really? I don't think you want to lose your job." The man pushed a business card toward the lawyer. "Think it over."

The lawyer's expression changed, and he forced a smile. "Alright, I'll tell you. She was consulting about a divorce."

The man got the answer he wanted and quickly left.

At the mansion, Bob reported, "Ms. Windsor-"

William shot him a sharp look, and Bob quickly corrected himself. "Mrs. Cavendish went back to her apartment and then to a law firm to consult about a divorce."

William's face darkened.

Did she hate him that much? No matter what, that was all in the past. In this life, he had never wronged her.

After a long pause, he spoke with difficulty. "Have someone follow her."

Given her current emotional state, William couldn't bring her home. He had to wait until they both calmed down and could talk openly.

Christina resumed her old life.

Elisa called her, hinting that since she was with William, she should get pregnant quickly to secure her position and ensure a worry-free future.

Christina was annoyed. "Don't worry about it. I have my own plans."

"What plans? Nicholas may have reluctantly agreed, but he's still not satisfied with you. If you have the Cavendish family's first grandchild, you'll be set for life," Elisa said earnestly.

Christina knew Elisa meant well, but she had no patience for it now. "It's over between us. Don't bring it up again."

Elisa was stunned and raised her voice. "Didn't you two want to get married? I'm just looking out for you. What's with the attitude?"

Christina moved the phone away, waiting for Elisa to finish ranting before coldly replying, "I have my own ideas. You don't need to worry about me."

With that, she hung up and ignored the subsequent calls.

She suspected William had gone to Elisa.

###chapter 150 Are You Willing to Go?

But now, no matter who tried to talk her out of it, she was firm in her decision.

There was no way she could make up with William and act like nothing had happened, just going through the motions for the rest of her life.

The hurt he caused couldn't be fixed with a few apologies and some compensation. Even if it could, Harper wouldn't come back, and no one else would feel the pain she had gone through!

She kept going to work at the architecture firm, and one day, Kelvin called her into his office.

"There's a relief project that needs architects in Eldoria. Would you be up for it?"

Christina was caught off guard. "What?"

Kelvin smiled and added, "It's not forever. At most, two or three years, and at least, six months."

The timeframe was tempting; it could help her gradually distance herself from everything here.

Christina didn't agree right away but hesitated. "Mr. Fisher, can I have some time to think about it?"

"Honestly, I'm in a tough spot too. The higher-ups want to send an architect, and you're not the top choice. But you're young and need more experience," Kelvin sighed. "Otherwise, there'd be a lot of complaints."

"I get it," Christina nodded. "I just have some things to sort out first. I'll give you an answer after I've thought it through."

"Alright. The place isn't too underdeveloped, and the basic living conditions are guaranteed. You don't need to worry too much," Kelvin reassured her.

Christina nodded.

As she left, she noticed Stanley standing outside the door. She was surprised. "Were you eavesdropping?"

Stanley's face showed a hint of awkwardness. "No, I just happened to be coming to see Mr. Fisher and overheard."

Christina nodded knowingly. "I see."

Stanley hesitated for a moment before asking, "Mr. Fisher said they're sending you to Eldoria. Do you want to go?"

"Whether I want to or not isn't the point. I need to think it over," Christina sighed and shook her head slightly.

Stanley nodded in understanding. "Alright, I'll go in now."

Christina acknowledged and turned to leave.

After work, as she was about to head home, a car suddenly stopped in front of her. The window rolled down, and it was William.

"We've had enough time to cool off. We need to sit down and talk."

"There's nothing to talk about between us. I hope the next time you appear in front of me is when we're finalizing our divorce," Christina said coldly.

With that, she walked straight ahead.

William quickly got out of the car and caught up to her in a few strides, grabbing her wrist.

"Christina, please listen to me," William's voice was pleading, his eyes filled with urgency and helplessness.

Christina looked at him, her heart full of rejection and disdain. She forcefully pulled her wrist free, her voice icy and devoid of warmth.

"I'm tired of your explanations, William. I'm no longer someone you can manipulate. Let the past stay in the past. There's no chance for us."

William's face turned pale, a flash of pain in his eyes. But he quickly spoke again, his voice hoarse.

"Christina, I know I've hurt you deeply. I know I can't make up for everything you've lost. But I sincerely hope you'll give me a chance to make amends."

Christina laughed, her smile dripping with sarcasm.

"William, who do you think you are? What right do you have to ask me for a chance? Do you think an apology can erase all my pain? You're so wrong."

"What will it take for you to feel better?" William grabbed her wrist again.

"Unless you die," Christina stared him down. "If you want me to talk to you nicely, die for me. Maybe in the next life, I'll give you a chance."

William stared at her for a long time before saying, "There is no next life."

At that moment, he realized how desperate Christina must have been to consider death and destruction, to reach a point where she believed there was no next life.

"Exactly, there's no next life. And there's no chance for us," Christina sneered. "You're a liar, and I'll never forgive you. Stop deluding yourself."

William's heart felt like it had been struck by a heavy blow.

He took a step back, then seemed to make a decision and grabbed her wrist again.

Christina looked at him warily. "What are you trying to do?"

"I won't let you run away from me," William's eyes showed determination.

Christina realized what he was about to do and tried to pull her wrist free. "Don't you dare."

But William lifted her up.

"Christina, I believe I can make it right."

His eyes were deep with resolve.

Christina didn't want to return to that dreadful situation and struggled fiercely.

But William was determined. No matter how much she struggled, he wouldn't let go. His eyes held both determination and an unspoken emotion.

"William, this is illegal!" Christina shouted, her voice filled with despair.

William's heart felt like it was being pierced, but he didn't let go. His voice was low and resolute.

"Christina, I'm willing to face any consequences, but I can't let you go. I need you with me."

Christina's eyes widened as she looked at William, seeing a stranger. Her heart was filled with fear, anger, and worry.

"William, are you crazy?" Christina screamed, her voice full of despair.

William didn't answer. He just held her tightly, as if afraid she would disappear if he let go.

Christina felt dizzy, her chest tight and nauseous.

William put her in the car, but as he went to the driver's seat, she opened the door and tumbled out, falling hard on the ground, scraping her knees and arms.

She got up and stumbled forward, but then a wave of dizziness hit her, and she collapsed, losing consciousness.

Hearing the commotion, William rushed over and lifted her up, anxiously calling, "Christina, Christina, wake up!"

Christina didn't respond.

William didn't dare delay and immediately took her to the hospital.

The doctors were busy examining her.

After the examination, the doctor said, "She might have fainted from emotional distress."

"Really? She's been unwell recently and was injured before. Could there be other reasons?" William was still worried.

###chapter 151  Cannot Have This Child

"Let's run a detailed blood test," the doctor said, jotting down the order before moving her to a regular room.

About half an hour later, Christina woke up. Seeing she was in a hospital room, she frowned and tried to get out of bed.

William immediately stepped in to support her. "Hey, don't move."

"Stop pretending you care," Christina snapped, shaking off his hand, her eyes blazing. "If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here."

William's hand froze mid-air.

Their interactions now were like enemies meeting, filled with intense animosity.

He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself.

"Christina, I know I can't undo the hurt I've caused you, but I was really out of options," William said, his voice low and filled with helplessness.

Christina looked at him coldly, her hatred burning like an unquenchable fire.

"Out of options? Your 'out of options' means hurting me, deceiving me, and controlling my life?" Christina's voice was full of anger and sorrow.

William didn't respond. He knew any explanation would be pointless in front of Christina.

Time passed in silence, and the atmosphere in the room grew heavier. Christina looked out the window, a hint of confusion in her eyes.

"I'm tired. Leave," Christina finally said, her voice weary and cold.

William gave her some space to cool down.

A nurse came in shortly after, glancing at Christina. "Ms. Windsor, you're fine now. The blood test results are back."

"If I'm fine, can I leave?" Christina asked, eager to get out of bed.

The nurse, however, was beaming. "Ms. Windsor, congratulations, you're pregnant."

Christina was stunned, the words hitting her like a sledgehammer.

Joseph had told her she was pregnant during a check-up, but she had been so consumed by her hatred for William that she had forgotten.

She instinctively shook her head, covering her stomach in fear.

"No, I can't have this baby!"

After everything that had happened, how could she bring a child into this world to suffer?

William had been happy, but his expression turned sad upon hearing her words.

Christina felt a pang of pain after saying it.

Abortion was different from birth control. This child had been inside her, and the thought of giving it up was heart-wrenching.

At that moment, Christina's emotions were incredibly complex.

The nurse gently suggested, "You're still early in your pregnancy. You have time to think it over."

William suddenly grabbed her wrist, his eyes red. "Let's go home and talk about this, okay?"

Christina didn't refuse.

Her change of heart wasn't because of William, but because of the child.

They drove home in silence. Once there, she sat on the couch while William handed her a cup of hot water.

Christina took it but didn't drink.

"Don't think having this child will change anything between us!"

Her sharp words felt like needles to William's heart. After a long pause, he sighed and held her hand.

"Can we keep this child?"

He remembered the day Christina mentioned the child's name. This child had to stay.

"You have no right to say that," Christina said, closing her eyes.

She gently touched her stomach, feeling the same emotions she had during her previous pregnancy.

She began to imagine that this child might be a gift from above, bringing her Harper back to her.

William knew her weak spot and spoke softly, "Maybe Harper has returned. Keep her, and I'll take good care of you both. Give me a chance to make things right."

Christina pushed his hand away, her gaze sharp.

"William, you have no right to ask for anything. Even if I keep this child, it's mine, and you have no right to be its father."

William stiffened at her words.

He knew little about her past life and couldn't fully understand her pain.

At this moment, anything he said or did felt insincere.

He gently hugged Christina. "Let's keep this child. Even if I can't be its father, I want you to be happy. You want Harper back, don't you?"

Christina pushed him away and turned her face.

William knew her well. If there was even a tiny chance to have Harper back, she might take it.

She closed her eyes in pain, her voice hoarse. "Leave me alone. Let me think."

William didn't insist.

"Okay."

The next morning, Bob came to confirm his schedule.

"Mr. Cavendish, you have a business trip abroad tomorrow. It'll take about three days."

William looked at him. "Cancel it."

"That's not possible unless we want to break ties and lose the deal," Bob sighed.

William didn't want to leave now.

But staying might not make Christina happy either.

After thinking it over, he decided to go. By the time he returned, she might have made up her mind.

No matter what Christina decided, he would do everything to keep this child. It might be their only chance to mend their relationship.

"Fine, make the arrangements. Leave a few people here to watch Christina. Don't let her go to the hospital for an abortion. Other than that, don't be too strict."

Bob was startled. An abortion?

He didn't dare ask what had happened, just nodded. "Mr. Cavendish, don't worry. I'll take care of it."

Christina barely slept that night. The next morning, she found breakfast ready on the table.

A note was stuck to the milk glass.

"I'm going on a business trip. When I return, I hope you've made a decision. Christina, give the child a chance, and give me a chance too."

Christina's brow twitched. She crumpled the note and threw it in the trash.

She didn't believe a word he said!

After breakfast, she went straight to the architecture firm.

Now that she was pregnant and wanted to keep the child, she didn't want to travel. She went to the office to inform Kelvin.

Kelvin frowned. "Are you sure about this?"

###chapter 152 Leaving Here

Christina nodded firmly. "Yeah, I was planning to move to Eldoria, but something came up, and I can't go now. Mr. Fisher, I hope you understand."

Kelvin frowned and waved his hand dismissively. "You need to think this through. This is a great opportunity. If you turn it down, the architecture firm will know it was you who refused, and it might affect your future career."

Christina bit her lip. "I've made up my mind."

Kelvin nodded. "Alright then."

Just then, Stanley appeared at the door. "I'll go."

Kelvin was surprised. "You? You've already done this kind of assignment before. Why go again?"

"The firm needs someone, and I don't want Christina's career to suffer. Besides, I could use more experience." Stanley took a deep breath.

"You've been abroad for years and just got back a few months ago. Don't you want to spend more time with your family?" Kelvin sighed.

This kind of situation happened to almost everyone who came to his firm. He was happy to see them take on challenging assignments to grow.

This time, it was supposed to be Christina's turn, but Stanley volunteered.

"I've thought it through, and my family supports me. Mr. Fisher, I just want to dive into the world of architecture." Stanley looked determined.

"If you're willing, who am I to say no?" Kelvin shook his head, stood up, and patted Stanley on the shoulder. "You're a good guy. Alright, it's settled. You both can go now."

Outside, Christina sincerely thanked Stanley.

Stanley waved it off with a gentle smile. "It's nothing. I can't do much for you, but I'm happy to help. I just want you to be happy."

Christina was deeply moved but also worried. "Thanks, but..."

What about Kaitlyn? Doesn't he want to stay for her? But Christina knew it was between them, and she shouldn't interfere.

As Christina was thinking, Kaitlyn arrived, greeting them cheerfully and winking playfully. "What are you two talking about? You weren't talking about me, were you?"

Christina shook her head with a smile. "No, why are you here today?"

"I wanted to invite Stanley out. There's a fantastic art and architecture exhibit today, and I thought it would be perfect for him." Kaitlyn spoke confidently, growing more enthusiastic as she continued.

Stanley thought for a moment and then agreed. "Sure, no problem."

Kaitlyn was stunned and blinked in surprise. "You never accepted my invitations before. Why so quick today?"

"I'm leaving soon. I should spend some time with you. After all, you're Kelvin's granddaughter, and we all care about you." Stanley smiled, but his words felt distant, making it hard to hear.

Kaitlyn immediately caught the key point and froze. "Leaving? Where are you going?"

Stanley didn't plan to hide it and explained his upcoming business trip.

Kaitlyn was shocked, her lips trembling as she struggled to find her voice. "How can you just leave? Don't you know how much I like you?"

"Feelings should be mutual, Kaitlyn. I can only see you as a sister," Stanley said seriously. "I hope you see me as a brother. I have my own path to follow."

Kaitlyn couldn't believe her ears. She thought their relationship had deepened after the last time at the hospital, but reality was harsh.

"Fine, who cares about you? There are plenty of men out there. I don't need you. I'll start dating tomorrow and find a great guy," Kaitlyn said, hoping Stanley would feel jealous and stop her.

But Stanley showed no reaction, as if he didn't care. Kaitlyn was furious, biting her lip. "Fine, go on your trip. When you come back, I'll invite you to my wedding. I've waited long enough."

She ran off, wiping her eyes. Christina wanted to follow but suddenly felt nauseous, leaning against the wall and dry heaving. By the time she felt better, Kaitlyn was gone.

Stanley immediately came over, concerned. "Are you okay? You haven't looked well lately."

Christina shook her head. "I'm fine. It's Kaitlyn who's upset. You should go after her."

"I don't want to give her false hope," Stanley smiled gently. "It's better to let her move on."

Though he was right, Christina was still worried. She called Kaitlyn to check on her, finally feeling relieved.



At a restaurant abroad.

Having met several times already, they were in the final negotiation stage, and everything went smoothly. After signing the contract, the client invited William to a winery event the next day.

William shook his head. "I appreciate the offer, but my schedule is tight. I don't think I can make it."

"Is someone back home waiting for you? You're heading back so soon?" The client chuckled.

William smiled. "Yes, my wife is pregnant, and I want to be with her."

"Of course, we shouldn't keep you then."

After a brief chat, the client left with the contract, promising to meet William's family next time. William agreed with a smile.

Leaving the restaurant, he called Bob to move his flight up to the next day.

"Got it, Mr. Cavendish," Bob replied.

Things had gone smoother than expected.

William's hotel was nearby, so he decided to walk. Passing a handmade toy store, he was drawn to the window display and quickly went inside.

###chapter 153  Past and Present Lives

The toy store was packed with all kinds of toys, dazzling and overwhelming. William had his eye on a few dolls, perfect for a little girl. If what Christina said was true-that their child in a past life was a girl-then the child who came to him in this life would surely be a girl too.

He picked out a few and headed to the checkout. The handmade dolls were unique, and he hoped that bringing them back would lift Christina's spirits.

As he stepped outside, gunshots suddenly rang out nearby.

He looked up to see several gunmen shooting at each other in the street. The pedestrians, terrified, screamed and scattered, seeking cover.

Just as William turned to retreat back into the store, a bullet suddenly struck him in the chest. He felt a warm gush of blood pour from his chest, and death seemed just a step away.

He looked down to see the blood silently flowing out. In that moment, he felt no fear, only a thought: if Christina saw his body, would she stop hating him and give birth to their child?

He fell back, powerless, as the store clerk rushed over, shouting, "Sir, wake up! Sir!" while dialing 911.

The paramedics arrived quickly, rushing him to the hospital and notifying Bob based on his last phone call.

When Bob got the call, his heart sank. "How could this happen?" After getting a brief explanation, he hurried to the hospital.

William felt like he had died and come back to life. When he opened his eyes, Christina was sitting in front of him with Harper. "Today is Harper's birthday. Did you come back just to tell me this? You didn't have to."

William was stunned and tried to speak gently, but found his body completely unresponsive.

"I warn you, don't try any tricks. If anything happens to Jennifer and her child, I won't forgive you."

"I never intended to play any tricks, William. If you don't want to, you can pretend Harper and I don't exist." Christina held Harper tightly, her eyes filled with determination.

William shook his head. How could he pretend they didn't exist?

But he saw himself, as if out of control, walking towards Christina and gripping her jaw harshly, his voice cold and unfeeling.

"Pretend you don't exist? Christina, after what you've done, how can I pretend you don't exist?"

He threw Christina aside and wiped his hands. "This is just the beginning. If you dare to scheme against me again, I'll make sure you pay dearly."

These weren't his words. William struggled silently, but it was useless. In the dream, he strode out the door, leaving the birthday celebration behind.

Harper, crying, ran after him. "Daddy, please don't go! You've never spent a birthday with me. Can you stay just this once?"

His heart was ice cold. He pried Harper's hands off and left the house without a word.

Christina ran up, holding the sobbing Harper, and shouted at his back, "William, you're too much!"

William paused but didn't turn back. He straightened his back and kept walking.

Later, William risked Harper's life to save Jennifer's son, leading to Harper's death on the operating table, leaving Christina completely shattered.

He saw Christina in black, standing by Harper's grave, her tears flowing silently. The suffering she had endured had numbed her heart.

She sat by the grave, holding it as if it were her daughter one last time.

"Harper, Mommy couldn't protect you. It's my fault. Hell is too cold. Mommy will join you soon."

The scene shifted to the mansion, engulfed in flames. Christina calmly looked at her daughter's photo, holding it as she faced death.

"No, don't!" He tried to rush into the fire to save Christina, but everything turned to ashes as soon as he stepped in. The world was desolate, leaving him alone.

It was all true. No wonder Christina hated him so much. What had he done?

The nightmare suffocated him, making him feel Christina's pain. He finally understood why she hated him so much, wishing him dead.

He woke up abruptly, seeing a white ceiling. He coughed violently, gasping for air.

Bob rushed in, almost in tears. "Mr. Cavendish, you're finally awake!"

He ran to the door, shouting, "Someone, the patient is awake!"

Doctors and nurses quickly came in, checking him over. The doctor sighed in relief. "Mr. Cavendish is out of danger."

Bob sighed too. "That's good. Thank you, everyone."

William felt a heavy pain in his chest, like a weight crushing him. He managed to ask, "Where am I?"

"Silver Crest Hospital, abroad," Bob replied.

"How long was I out?" William felt like an eternity had passed. He needed to know how much time had gone by.

"Four days," Bob said solemnly.

Four days? It had only been four days.

But the things he dreamed felt like a lifetime. He couldn't imagine how Christina endured those years, day by day.

At that moment, he truly empathized. He felt the guilt of both his past and present selves merging, deepening his remorse.

He struggled to get out of bed. "I need to go back home."

Bob quickly supported him. "Mr. Cavendish, you just got out of danger. You can't."

"I said, I need to go back home." William's cold eyes left no room for negotiation.

Bob had no choice but to agree. "Alright, Mr. Cavendish. I'll arrange it."

A day later, the plane finally landed back home.

Ignoring his discomfort, he rushed home and saw Christina coming down the stairs. He quickly walked up and hugged her tightly.

"Christina."

###chapter 154  Can He Really Be a Good Father?

Christina froze for a moment, then shoved him away with disgust.

"Move."

The pain from his wound almost knocked him out. He staggered back a few steps, then dropped to one knee, barely holding himself up with his arm.

"Quit faking it," Christina said coldly, then walked over to the dining table and sat down, eating like he wasn't even there.

Bob stepped forward to help him, but William pushed him away.

He struggled to his feet and walked to the table. "Christina, I'm sorry. I finally get why you wanted me gone."

Christina didn't respond, continuing to eat calmly, treating him like he was invisible. Even if she wanted to keep the baby, to bring back the Harper she lost, it didn't mean she forgave William, or that he could be the child's father.

William's body was on the verge of collapse after the long journey. He swayed, barely able to stand.

Bob stepped forward and supported him. "Mr. Cavendish, you need to rest. We should get you to the hospital to check that wound. It could be serious if not treated properly."

William nodded. "Alright."

Christina noticed something was wrong with him, but she just glanced at him coldly and continued her dinner.

William felt a sharp pain in his heart. Now, he finally understood Christina's situation.

The next day, while Christina was out at the architecture firm, he called in some help. They spent the whole day cleaning and buying things, finally filling the empty room.

The once-empty room was now a cozy nursery, with cute stickers, pink decor, and a small rocking crib. He even placed the two toys he brought back from abroad by the bed.

Bob brought him a cup of hot water and advised, "Mr. Cavendish, your body hasn't recovered yet. You shouldn't overdo it."

William looked around the room, satisfied. "It's nice. Close the door for now."

Bob helped him downstairs, then turned back to close the room door.

After changing the dressing on his wound to prevent infection, Bob urged him several times to go to the hospital, but he refused, changing the dressing himself. "You can go now. Only bring me important matters from the company."

"Alright, Mr. Cavendish," Bob sighed and left quickly.

It was late when Christina returned. She turned on the light and was startled to see William sitting on the couch. But she ignored him and headed upstairs.

William suddenly woke up and called out, "Christina."

She paused slightly and turned back, her voice indifferent. "What is it?"

Seeing that she was willing to respond, William's face lit up with joy. He quickly walked over. "I want to show you something."

"I'm not going," Christina refused.

"It's just upstairs," William gently took her hand.

Christina stiffened and shook off his hand. "If you want to go, go. Don't touch me."

William didn't mind and led her to the room on the second floor. Once she was standing there, he opened the door. "Look."

Christina was stunned. She looked around the room, which was warmly decorated, much like the room from her past life. The walls were adorned with playful stickers, the ceiling with handmade paper cranes and airplanes, and string lights twinkled softly.

The small bed rocked gently, and she could almost see baby Harper lying there, smiling and cooing at her.

She walked in as if in a trance, touching the decorations and picking up the stuffed animals on the bed.

"I brought these back from my trip abroad. I think our daughter will like them. The room is still a bit empty, but we can fill it up little by little, preparing for the baby's arrival," William said gently.

Christina turned to him, the warmth in her eyes quickly suppressed.

"I never said I was keeping this baby."

William took a deep breath and said sincerely, "I know. I'll respect your choice. But I want you to see that I'm ready to be a father."

Christina looked at the cozy room, but memories of the past made her fear he might reveal his true, monstrous nature at any moment.

She shook her head, suppressing the warmth in her heart. "That's your business."

With that, she turned and left, returning to her own room.

William felt a sharp pain in his chest. He leaned on the bed for support, feeling slightly better.

Christina lay in bed, gently stroking her belly, her emotions in turmoil. Could William really be a good father?

She wanted Harper back, but as Harper's mother, she knew her child well. In the past life, Harper had always longed for a father, even though she pretended to be strong and comforted Christina, saying it was okay without one.

Some things, once started, couldn't be changed.

Would fate's trajectory continue to align with the past after a delay? She couldn't be sure.

The next morning, the table was filled with a variety of breakfast foods.

Christina was startled when she came downstairs. William immediately stood up. "I heard you have a poor appetite during pregnancy. See if there's anything you like."

"You don't need to bother. I have no appetite," Christina said calmly.

"You're pregnant. You should eat something," William said, coughing lightly.

Christina looked at his expression, feeling like he had changed since his return. He seemed less aggressive, more gentle and cautious.

She felt it might be her imagination. After thinking for a moment, she sat at the table and slowly ate breakfast.

William's face lit up with joy. He quickly served her more food. "Eat more."

She didn't speak. After finishing her meal, she went to work as usual. Lunch and dinner were delivered, with healthy and varied dishes filling the table, drawing teasing comments from others.

She felt uncomfortable with the attention. After working late, she went to William's room to tell him to stop with the extravagant meals.

But when she opened the door slightly, she saw a projector running, displaying a lecture on the wall about how to care for a pregnant woman.

###chapter 155 Perhaps

At that moment, Christina felt a strange ripple in her heart. Maybe he really had realized his mistakes and was genuinely looking forward to the birth of their daughter.

But then she snapped back to reality. A leopard doesn't change its spots. All those things he did in the past were his true nature. How could he change so quickly?

She must have been standing outside the door for too long because William sensed something was off. He slowly turned around, and when he saw her, a smile appeared on his face.

"Hey, you're back. Wanna join me in learning this?"

Christina's gaze wavered slightly, and she frowned. "I already know how to do it."

"Oh, right. Sorry, I forgot." William stood there, looking a bit flustered.

Christina glanced at the projection again. It was showing how to massage a pregnant woman to make her feel better. She had never enjoyed such treatment. She didn't know if he was just being enthusiastic for the moment or if he genuinely cared.

She suddenly realized she was being swayed by his little tricks again. William was not to be trusted!

Taking a deep breath, she let out a cold laugh and said sarcastically, "Cut the crap, William. It's too late for you to learn how to be a dad now! I haven't even decided if I want to keep this baby. Even if I do, she won't grow up here."

She walked over, turned off the projector, and quickly left the room.

William watched her leave and sighed deeply. There was still time. He had patience and could take things slowly.

This baby seemed like an angel. Christina only felt nauseous for two days. After a check-up and some vitamins, she had almost no pregnancy symptoms. In her past life, Harper was the same. Knowing Christina was having a hard time, Harper stayed quietly in her womb until she was full-term.

The longer Christina was pregnant, the deeper she felt her connection with Harper. Her little angel Harper couldn't bear to see her suffer alone, so she chose to come back.

That night, Christina didn't sleep well. She dreamt of Harper holding a stuffed animal, standing timidly in front of her.

"Mommy, I'm back. Will you still want me?"

Tears streamed down her face as she pulled Harper into her arms, crying uncontrollably. "Of course, you'll always be my daughter."

Harper smiled and snuggled into her embrace. "Mommy is the best."

She woke up suddenly, realizing it was just a dream.

Sitting up, she held her belly, feeling both touched and hopeful.

At that moment, the door opened, and she saw William standing there. She took a step back, wary.

"What are you doing here?"

William saw her expression and gave a bitter smile. "I heard you weren't sleeping well, so I came to check on you."

Christina's gaze was cold. "You don't need to pretend."

Hearing her distant tone, William sighed and told her to rest well before leaving quickly.

Christina took a deep breath and lay back down.

Work had been going smoothly, and her pregnancy symptoms were minimal, giving her plenty of time to work on her designs.

She even designed a bedroom for Harper, wanting her to grow up happily.

If possible, she wanted to move out and raise Harper on her own.

But after consulting a lawyer, she learned that getting a divorce while pregnant was difficult, especially if the husband didn't agree.

So she had to put that idea on hold, planning to fight for custody after the baby was born. She was determined to keep Harper with her.

While at work, Kaitlyn suddenly called her.

She answered casually. "Hey, what's up?"

"Christina, you have to help me," Kaitlyn's voice sounded anxious and urgent.

"What's going on?" Christina could tell she wasn't joking and became tense.

Kaitlyn gritted her teeth and spoke slowly. "I went on a date and ran into a creep. They won't let me leave. You're my only friend. I don't know who else to call. Please come help me."

Christina immediately stood up, worried. "Where are you? Send me your location. I'll be right there."

"Okay, hurry." Kaitlyn sent her location to Christina's phone.

Just as Christina was about to leave, she ran into Stanley.

Seeing her in a rush, Stanley asked, "Where are you going?"

"Kaitlyn's in trouble. I need to find her," Christina answered honestly.

Stanley's expression changed. "It's too dangerous for you to go alone. I'll come with you."

"Okay." Christina agreed without hesitation.

They hurried out of the office. Christina sat in the passenger seat, anxious. Stanley drove quickly but remained calm, knowing that panic would only make things worse.

Soon, they arrived at the location Kaitlyn had sent. It was a secluded café. Christina spotted Kaitlyn, looking distressed and surrounded by several men.

"Kaitlyn!" Christina shouted, rushing over.

The men turned, startled by Christina and Stanley's sudden appearance. Christina seized the moment, grabbed Kaitlyn, and pulled her away.

"What are you doing? She's our girlfriend!" one of the men protested.

Stanley glared at them. "Your behavior is harassment. If you don't back off, I'll call the police."

"Call the police?" The man sneered, rolling up his sleeves. "I have money and power. Go ahead, call them. I'd love to see them sort this out. Miss Fisher came for a date, criticized us, and insulted us. Isn't that a crime too?"

"What do you want?" Christina shielded Kaitlyn.

"She should date our boss," the man pointed to a slim, black-clad man in his thirties.

Kaitlyn was furious. "You're delusional!"

The black-clad man approached, his eyes cold. "Miss Fisher, you're disrespecting me. We had an agreement, and you should honor it."

Christina held Kaitlyn's hand tightly, reassuring her. Then she turned to the man. "Sir, dating is a mutual decision. If Kaitlyn isn't interested, you should respect her feelings and not force her."

###chapter 156 Do You Have the Right to Speak?

The man in black glared at Christina with a menacing look. "Who the hell are you? Do you even belong here?"

Stanley stepped forward, his face calm. "I'm her friend, and I have every right to stand up for her."

Kaitlyn felt a surge of gratitude for Stanley's defense. She lifted her chin defiantly. "I've already told you, I'm not interested in any of you."

"So you came here just to mess with us?" The man clenched his fist. "Looks like you need to be taught a lesson!"

He waved his hand, and a group of men with clenched fists moved forward.

Kaitlyn, terrified, hid behind Christina. "Christina, what do we do?"

Christina was equally at a loss. Kaitlyn had called her, thinking the situation wouldn't be too hard to handle, but now these men looked ready to pounce.

Stanley, usually seen as a mild-mannered scholar, now showed a hint of toughness as he stood in front of them.

"You two, get out of here!"

"No way, Stanley, you can't take them on alone!" Kaitlyn didn't want to leave him behind.

Seeing him standing protectively in front of her, she was even more certain that he still had feelings for her. Her fading love reignited fiercely.

"Go now." Stanley's calm demeanor was gone, replaced by tension.

Christina quickly grabbed Kaitlyn's arm. "Let's call the cops."

She pulled out her phone and swiftly dialed 911.

As she was explaining the situation to the dispatcher, one of the men noticed them and stormed over, teeth clenched.

"You're asking for it!"

He shouted at Christina and Kaitlyn, raising his fist as if to strike. Kaitlyn turned pale with fear, while Christina held her hand tightly, staring resolutely at the man.

Just then, Stanley darted forward, blocking their path. His movements were swift, and he grabbed the man's wrist, twisting it to deflect the punch.

"Try touching them, I dare you!" Stanley's voice was icy.

But he was outnumbered. As soon as he spoke, he was pulled aside by the others!

In the chaos, someone crashed into Christina, causing her to drop her phone, which hit the ground.

She stumbled back, losing her balance and falling, pain radiating from her ankle.

Kaitlyn screamed and tried to help her, but was grabbed by someone nearby. Amidst the confusion, she saw Stanley being attacked by several men, still trying to protect them.

"Christina!" Kaitlyn cried out.

Christina felt a sudden dizziness, as if she had been hit on the head, and she lost consciousness.

At that moment, the sound of police sirens filled the air.

Hearing the sirens, the attackers quickly scattered.

Stanley had some injuries, and with Christina unconscious, the police didn't bother with statements right away. They called an ambulance and rushed them to the hospital.

Christina was taken straight to the emergency room.

Kaitlyn and Stanley waited outside, pacing anxiously for news.

Bob arrived after hearing what happened. He didn't know the details and, with William recovering from a gunshot wound, he hadn't dared to tell him about this incident.

After more than half an hour, the emergency room doors finally opened, and the doctor came out.

"The patient is out of danger."

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

Soon, Christina was wheeled out, awake but feeling dizzy. Her main concern was her abdomen, which felt fine, so she assumed everything was okay.

Kaitlyn rushed over. "Christina, how are you feeling? I thought I was going to get you killed."

"I'm fine." Christina rubbed Kaitlyn's cheek. "Stop feeling guilty. Be more mature and think things through in the future."

"I will!" Kaitlyn nodded earnestly.

Christina didn't have the strength to talk much. Her head was spinning, and she felt nauseous, not wanting to move at all.

The doctor had mentioned she might have a mild concussion and needed to stay for observation, which she agreed to.

She just wanted some peace and quiet, without anyone around. Stanley and Kaitlyn left the room together.

Kaitlyn looked at Stanley with a hopeful expression. "Stanley, you rushed here when you heard I was in danger. You must have feelings for me, right?"

Stanley's eyes were cold. "Kaitlyn, you're twenty now. It's time to grow up. Your reckless actions put yourself in danger. Did you ever think about others?"

Kaitlyn was stunned.

"Stanley, I was just so upset. I was upset that you didn't have feelings for me."

"So you went on random dates? Do you even know what kind of people they are? Kaitlyn, have some self-respect." Stanley's tone was stern.

Kaitlyn's face turned pale. She hadn't realized her impulsive actions would cause Stanley so much trouble, and she felt a pang of guilt.

She lowered her head, biting her lip, her voice trembling. "I understand, Stanley. I'm sorry. I won't be so impulsive again."

Stanley's stern look softened into one of helplessness.

"Kaitlyn, I know how you feel about me, but I can only see you as a sister. I don't want you to ruin your life because of me. I can't bear that burden."

Kaitlyn bit her lip hard and nodded. "I understand. I won't cause you any more trouble."

His words, though harsh, were meant to be kind.

Her heart had already been hurt once, and the pain was unbearable. After this, she knew she had to grow up.

Stanley sighed and turned to leave, but suddenly felt a sharp pain in his abdomen, as if the adrenaline had worn off and the pain hit him all at once.

He took a few steps and stumbled to the ground.

Kaitlyn immediately noticed something was wrong and rushed to his side. "Stanley, you're hurt too. You haven't been checked yet."

"It's nothing!" Stanley shook his head, trying to stand.

But every movement brought intense pain, making it impossible to move.

###chapter 157 You Lied!

Kaitlyn tried to help him up several times but couldn't, so she rushed to call the doctor.

"Doctor, hurry, please!"

The doctor arrived quickly and examined Stanley. After a thorough check, he said seriously, "Looks like his ribs are fractured. He needs surgery right away."

Kaitlyn's face went pale. She hadn't realized Stanley was so badly hurt. She held his hand tightly, tears welling up in her eyes. "Stanley, hang in there. You gotta stay strong."

Stanley forced a smile to comfort her. "Don't worry, I'm okay. Just hurts a bit."

The doctor quickly arranged for the surgery. Kaitlyn sat on a chair outside the operating room, filled with worry and guilt. If it weren't for her, Stanley wouldn't be so badly injured.

Hours later, the operating room door finally opened. The doctor came out, removed his mask, and said with a relaxed expression, "The surgery went well. His ribs are fixed. As long as he rests, he should be fine."

Kaitlyn breathed a sigh of relief, tears streaming down her face. She hurriedly asked, "How is he now? Can he talk?"

"He's still under anesthesia. Once he wakes up, he should be able to talk," the doctor replied.

Kaitlyn went in to see Stanley. His face was pale, but his breathing was steady. She sat by his bed, gently holding his hand, and whispered, "Stanley, don't worry. I'll take care of you."

After a long while, Stanley finally opened his eyes and spoke with difficulty.

"Why are you still here?"

"You broke your ribs. How could I not take care of you?" Kaitlyn was almost in tears with joy seeing him awake.

Stanley tried to sit up, but a sharp pain made him lie back down.

Kaitlyn bit her lip, as if making a firm decision. "Stanley, the doctor said you need to rest well. You can't go to Eldoria now. I turned it down for you."

"You!" Stanley was furious but couldn't say a word.

"If you want to blame someone, blame me. But I can't watch you go to a place like that and suffer. The medical conditions might be poor. You need to recover fully without any complications, or I'll feel guilty for the rest of my life. Please, just agree with me."

Kaitlyn lowered her head, like a child waiting to be scolded.

Stanley looked at Kaitlyn, a complex emotion flashing in his eyes. But soon, he sighed softly and gave a helpless smile.

"Alright, I guess there's no other choice now."

The next day, after Christina's follow-up showed no issues, Bob informed William about her injury.

William rushed to the hospital. "Why didn't you tell me sooner?"

Bob lowered his head. "Mr. Cavendish, I was worried about your gunshot wound."

"Don't make decisions like this again, or I'll fire you," William threatened coldly.

Bob bit his lip. "Yes, Mr. Cavendish, I understand."

Due to dizziness and nausea, Christina hadn't eaten much. She had more tests to undergo and had no appetite. William brought some appetizing breakfast.

"Try to eat something?"

Christina shook her head and turned away. "I don't want to eat."

William gently placed a pillow behind her back to make her more comfortable. "It's too dangerous for you to be out and about. Since you're pregnant, you should rest at home. Everything's set up for you."

"You want me to stay home like before, never seeing the light of day, at your mercy, and then have the baby, binding me forever? William, that's quite the plan," Christina sneered.

William frowned. "I never thought that way, Christina. Can't we be civil?"

"You may not have thought it, but you've done it. William, I can't stand the sight of you. Stay away from me." Christina turned to look out the window.

William's body stiffened, and he coughed lightly. "Fine, get some rest."

With that, he quickly left the room.

Bob, aware of the tension inside, was shocked. In all these years, he had never seen any woman speak to William so sharply. Christina was the first and only one.

But this woman seemed to have a heart of steel, impossible to break through.

He silently followed William out.

William left the room, his face dark. Bob followed closely, cautiously asking, "Mr. Cavendish, do you need to have your wound checked? You were just discharged recently."

William shook his head. "No, I'm fine."

Bob hesitated, then gathered his courage to ask, "Mr. Cavendish, did you and Ms. Windsor have a fight?"

William paused, his tone heavy. "We had a disagreement, but I didn't expect her to be this angry."

Bob gently reassured him. "Maybe it's just her pregnancy making her more emotional. Don't take it too hard, Mr. Cavendish."

William sighed deeply, a weary look on his face. "I know, but I feel like we're drifting further apart."

Bob said nothing more, silently accompanying William out of the hospital.

After confirming there were no issues, Christina was discharged.

Her baby was healthy and hadn't been harmed by her head injury and subsequent coma, which was a relief to her.

When she got home, the downstairs lights were off, but the warm orange light in the baby's room upstairs was on.

She slowly went upstairs and opened the door a crack. William was inside, setting things up. His gunshot wound hadn't healed, so he moved slowly, but each action was careful and deliberate.

Sensing her presence, he looked up and saw her standing at the door. He smiled. "Christina, you're back. Look, do you think our baby will like it?"

Christina quickly walked in.

The once blank walls were now adorned with drawings of Harper, drawn by William. His drawing skills weren't exceptional, but each stroke was filled with care and looked very much like Harper.

"Did you draw these based on my sketches?" Christina asked, looking up at him.

William gazed earnestly into her eyes. "To be honest, I saw her in my dreams. She's adorable and calls me Daddy."

Christina's expression darkened instantly. She gritted her teeth. "You're lying!"

William was puzzled.

Christina glared at him defiantly. "She hates you! How could she call you Daddy?"

###chapter 158 I Really Can't Go with You

"I didn't lie to you," William said, glancing around the room. "I just wanted to tell you that I'm ready to be a dad."

Christina was seething with rage.

He was the one who caused Harper's death, so how could he be so calm now? How could he be so happy about Harper's arrival?

Christina glared at William, her eyes filled with a mix of emotions. She took a deep breath, trying to suppress the turmoil inside her, but the pain and anger surged like a tidal wave.

"William, you don't deserve to be a father," she finally said, her voice icy. "What right do you have to decorate this room? What right do you have to even mention Harper?"

William's expression shifted slightly. He hadn't expected Christina to react so strongly. He opened his mouth to say something but ultimately lowered his head in silence.

"Christina, I know I messed up before. I know I let you and our daughter down," William's voice was low, tinged with undeniable weariness. "I just want to make things right."

"Make things right?" Christina scoffed. "Do you think everything can be fixed with an apology? You're overestimating yourself, William."

William lifted his head, a determined look in his eyes. "I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you, whether you accept it or not."

Christina had heard enough. She looked around the room with a blank expression and began tearing down all the decorations, ripping the paintings to shreds.

"William, first of all, I haven't decided if I'm going to keep this baby. And even if I do, I won't let you be a part of her life. Stop wasting your time."

She tore at everything like a madwoman, silent tears streaming down her face.

He doesn't deserve it. He will never deserve to be a father!

William, afraid she might hurt herself, rushed forward and held her tightly.

"Please, Christina, don't do this to yourself!"

Christina closed her eyes, feeling all her strength drain away. She took a deep breath and said calmly, "Let go of me."

Sensing her calmness, William slowly released his grip.

Christina turned to look at him. "William, stop trying. It only makes me despise you more."

"Do you believe me? I really remember what happened in our past lives," William said, holding her hand and looking her in the eye with sincerity. "I remember how awful I was to you, how I neglected our daughter. Believe me, after everything, I will cherish you both."

Christina sneered.

How could that be possible? Would a villain remember his past misdeeds and think of making amends? More likely, he would try to cover them up.

Seeing Christina's reaction, William felt a deep bitterness.

Christina didn't want to argue with him any longer. She pushed him away.

In that moment, William felt a sharp pain in his chest, as if his wound had been torn open.

He staggered back a few steps, clutching his chest and leaning against the wall.

Christina hesitated for a moment, instinctively wanting to check on him, but then she stopped herself.

"Take care of yourself, William."

With that, she slammed the door and left.

William looked at the chaotic room, a wave of indescribable loss and pain washing over him.

Christina, pregnant with their child, couldn't afford to be careless about her health.

A few days later, she went to the hospital for a follow-up on her head injury and a prenatal checkup.

Fortunately, her fall had only caused a mild concussion, with no serious consequences. Otherwise, if something had happened to her while she was pregnant, the baby might not have survived.

In the obstetrics department, the doctor was examining the ultrasound, making Christina anxious. "How am I doing, doctor?"

"Good news, the embryo is developing perfectly. The baby should be healthy," the doctor said with a smile.

Christina sighed in relief.

The doctor looked at the various test results and then said, "You're a bit low on vitamins. How's your appetite?"

"I don't feel particularly nauseous, but I don't have much of an appetite either. It's about the same as before," Christina replied thoughtfully.

"Your baby is absorbing nutrients from you, so you need to pay extra attention to your diet. I'll prescribe some prenatal vitamins for you. They're very effective," the doctor said, writing out a prescription.

Christina nodded, following the doctor's advice.

She had taken these vitamins in her past life, so they were familiar to her.

However, she still had to go to the architecture firm regularly and didn't want anyone to find out. She planned to buy some unmarked bottles to keep the vitamins in her bag discreetly.

But as she left the hospital, she ran into Walter.

Walter's expression was one of surprise when he saw Christina.

"Christina, are you sick?"

Christina shook her head, forcing a smile. "No, I'm fine."

She didn't plan to tell anyone about her pregnancy, not even Walter.

"I've been wanting to see you, but I couldn't find you. I didn't expect to run into you here," Walter said, looking at her closely.

"You want to talk about what happened to me before, right?" Christina said with a bitter smile.

Walter nodded. "The last time I saw you, you were still at odds with William. I didn't expect you to marry him so quickly."

"I lost my memory," Christina said, biting her lip. "Otherwise, I would never have married him."

"I knew it. How could you change your mind so quickly?" Walter sighed in relief. "Let's not talk here. Let's find a place to sit."

Walter took Christina to a quiet café.

Once they were seated, Walter looked at Christina deeply before speaking. "Christina, are you really planning to stay with William?"

Christina gritted her teeth and shook her head firmly. "Of course not."

Walter didn't ask for details. Hearing her answer, a look of relief crossed his face.

"That's good. Christina, things have gotten out of control. It's not something you or I can manage. Let him go and free yourself. I'll take you abroad. We can start over somewhere new."

Christina was taken aback by his words and shook her head almost immediately. "I'm sorry, I can't go with you."

"Why not?" Walter asked urgently. "Staying here will only bring you pain. I can give you a fresh start, just the two of us."

###chapter 159 How Will You Help Me?

Christina stood her ground. "I have my reasons. I'm sorry, but I just can't agree to this."

"Is it because you're in love with William? Christina, he's not someone you can count on forever. We still have a chance to start over." Walter held her hand tightly, refusing to let go.

Christina yanked her hand back so hard that her bag fell off the table, spilling its contents, including a bottle of vitamins.

Walter immediately bent down to pick them up.

When he saw the label on the bottle, he couldn't help but tremble. "Prenatal vitamins? You're pregnant? Is it William's?"

Christina's eyes darted away as she hurriedly gathered the pills back into her bag. "Don't ask anymore."

"Why?" Walter's emotions flared, his eyes almost bloodshot as he grabbed her arm, trying to see into her heart.

Christina winced in pain, gasping. "Let go!"

Walter realized he was out of line and quickly released her wrist. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you. Christina, are you really going to sacrifice everything for this child? It's a lifelong commitment."

"I haven't thought about it that way." Christina took a sip of her coffee, the bitterness spreading through her mouth.

"Then what are you thinking?" Walter's eyes were still intense.

Christina took a deep breath. "I have my own plans, but I definitely won't spend my life with him in confusion."

Walter closed his eyes, as if making a difficult decision, then looked at her seriously. "Christina, if you're willing, I can take you abroad. You can have the baby there, and I don't care who the father is. I'll be a good dad."

"Are you crazy?" Christina shook off his hand. "Don't be like this. I'm keeping the baby, but my child doesn't necessarily need a father."

Walter was stunned.

At that moment, William suddenly appeared, wrapping his arm around Christina as if to claim her. "Claiming this child as yours would mess up the family tree."

Someone had been keeping an eye on Christina and informed William as soon as Walter met her at the hospital. Naturally, William saw Walter as a threat and rushed over.

Walter stood up, squinting at him, and didn't hesitate to confront him. "Even so, if you can't make Christina happy, it's only right for me to take her away."

William sneered. "Don't kid yourself. You can't even protect yourself abroad, let alone your woman."

"You!" Walter was infuriated, feeling humiliated.

He lunged forward, and the tension between them was palpable.

Christina frowned, stood up, and sighed. "If you two want to fight, wait until I leave. I have to go."

With that, she turned and walked towards the door.

Walter chased after her. "Christina."

Christina turned back and said calmly, "I'm not going with you, Walter. I'll always see you as family."

Walter could only watch helplessly as she walked away.

In the car, William sat next to her. "Did you even think about going with him for a second?"

"Do you want me to go with him?" Christina glanced at him. "Maybe it would be a good choice. He might be a better father."

Before she could finish, William sighed and almost leaned on her, filled with jealousy. "No way. She's my daughter. How could she call someone else 'Dad'?"

"You don't even like her. I can decide who she calls 'Dad.'" Christina pushed him away and turned her face.

William stared into her eyes seriously. "Christina, I'll be a good father. From now on, our child will only have me as a father."

Christina glanced at him without speaking, then looked away. After a long silence, she chuckled. "Your promises mean nothing to me."

She closed her eyes, shutting out the world, ignoring everyone.

William felt a pang of anxiety. Even though she hadn't agreed to Walter's request this time, what if a better man came along and offered to take her away and be the father of her child? He couldn't be sure she wouldn't be tempted.

When they got back, a candlelit dinner was already set up on the table.

Christina, feeling exhausted, said, "I don't want to eat anything. I'm going upstairs to rest."

As she passed the nursery, the door was locked. She couldn't see inside and sighed before locking herself in her room.

In a dimly lit bar, the flashing lights made it hard to keep one's eyes open. In the loneliness of the night, alcohol became the best companion. Walter drank one glass after another, but the more he drank, the clearer his mind became.

"What kind of lousy drink is this? It doesn't even get you drunk." He slapped a wad of cash on the bar. "Bring me the strongest stuff you have."

Before the bartender could serve him, a figure in red appeared beside him. Walter glanced up, his expression changing.

"Rhea!"

Rhea greeted him. "Surprised? Ever since you left, I've been thinking about you. Finally, I found you again."

Walter shook his head dismissively and continued to drink.

Rhea looked at him with a smile. "You're in a bad mood. Who upset you?"

"What? You want to help me?" Walter laughed bitterly. "Even if you wanted to, it wouldn't matter. That guy pulled me back to the States. His power is overwhelming."

Rhea's eyes lit up with determination. "So it's him. No matter, I'm not afraid. I want revenge. But didn't he save you? Why are you two at odds now?"

"He's just a hypocrite," Walter scoffed.

"Looks like we have a common goal. How about we team up?" Rhea narrowed her eyes and extended her hand. "Shall we have a drink to celebrate our partnership?"

Walter thought for a moment, then shook her hand. "Alright, to a successful partnership."

They smiled, their eyes burning with a shared hatred.

###chapter 160 Attending the Funeral

A few days later, Christina got a bunch of messages.

They were from her class president, Tony Gibson: "Christina, our old teacher Mr. Ralph Cook passed away suddenly. His funeral is tomorrow. Can you make it?"

"Whether you can come or not, please let me know. I need to get a headcount."

Christina's first reaction was disbelief.

Ralph was only in his thirties, in the prime of his life. How could he have died?

She even thought it might be a cruel joke.

But the message was from Tony, so to be sure, she decided to ask: "When did this happen?"

"Two days ago. Mr. Ralph Cook had a heart attack while staying up late grading papers. He was rushed to the hospital but didn't make it. His obituary is already on Facebook." Tony replied quickly, clearly holding his phone.

He even sent a screenshot of the obituary to Christina: "I know it's hard to believe. When I first heard the news, I thought it was fake too. But it's true. As his students, the least we can do is be there for his final journey."

"I'll be there on time," Christina replied, staring at her phone screen, feeling a heavy weight in her chest.

In her previous life, she remembered Ralph didn't die so young.

Maybe her rebirth caused a butterfly effect, changing everyone's life paths.

But why could she change others' lives but not her own?

And what about her Harper...

Thinking about this made her even more upset, so she decided to sleep, hoping to numb herself.

But that night, she tossed and turned, unable to sleep.

The next morning, Christina got up early. Since she was going to a funeral, she didn't dress up, choosing a black and white outfit from her closet and heading out.

The funeral was held at the cemetery.

As she got out of the car, she immediately saw Tony standing outside. She walked over to greet him.

"Let's go. I'll take you in," Tony said, leading her inside.

The atmosphere between them was heavy and somber.

Before they even reached Ralph's grave, they heard heart-wrenching cries ahead. Just hearing the sound, one could imagine the pain the person was in.

"Mrs. Blair Cook must have cried all night. Her eyes are swollen, and Ralph's two kids have been calling for their dad. They only quieted down because they got tired," Tony said, stopping, his eyes filled with sorrow.

As students, they couldn't accept Ralph's sudden death.

How could Ralph's family, his wife and kids, accept it?

Christina sighed heavily, "Ralph was so responsible. He cared deeply for every student, even the most troublesome ones."

If Ralph hadn't been so dedicated, if he had just gone home after work without worrying about students failing, he might not have died so young.

Tony sighed too.

Seeing them approach, Blair stood up, wiped her tears, and forced a smile that looked more painful than crying. "You must be his students. I'm sorry I'm not in the best mood today."

"Mrs. Cook, we're here to pay our respects to Ralph. Please, don't worry about us. Try not to be too sad," Christina said, trying to comfort her.

In a way, Christina could empathize with Blair.

In her past life, when she lost her daughter, the pain was indescribable. Losing a loved one is the greatest pain in the world.

She lost her daughter, and Blair lost her husband. The two kids lost their father.

Christina stayed by Blair's side, helping to comfort the children.

"Sis, is my dad never coming back? They say my dad is dead. What does dead mean?" the little girl asked, clutching Christina's clothes.

She looked so pitiful and helpless.

Christina picked her up and gently comforted her, "Your dad has gone to a faraway place and can't come back for now, but he will always protect you."

"Doesn't Dad miss us?" the little girl continued.

"Of course he does," Christina said softly, wiping away her tears. "That's why he will always watch over you. You need to grow up well and take care of your mom."

"I will," the little girl nodded firmly.

She would wait for the day her dad returned and show him that she and her brother were good kids and that their mom was doing well.

Soon, other classmates arrived.

Jennifer found Missy in the crowd and pulled her aside, lowering her voice, "Did you prepare everything I asked for?"

"Yes, but there are so many people today. I'm a bit scared," Missy said, feeling nervous about doing something like this for the first time.

But she knew that once she agreed to Jennifer's plan, there was no turning back.

Jennifer could help her leave Emerald Lakeside and live the high-society life she dreamed of, but she could also destroy her completely.

"What are you afraid of? I've arranged everything. Just do as I say, and there won't be any problems," Jennifer said, frowning. "Don't back out now. Doesn't your family need money for medicine?"

That money was crucial. Without Jennifer's help, Missy couldn't earn enough even if she worked around the clock as a waitress.

Missy couldn't just watch her family suffer.

"I'll do as you say. But if William finds out, will you help me?" Missy asked, gripping Jennifer's hand tightly.

Jennifer frowned deeper, "William is on my side. We're getting married. You don't need to worry about that. I'll handle everything."

With Jennifer's assurance, Missy felt more at ease.

She blended in with the crowd, attending the funeral without raising any suspicion.

After the funeral, everyone went to a hotel for a meal. Missy took the opportunity to slip out of the banquet hall.

She took a small bottle from her bag, containing a colorless, odorless drug she had bought from the black market. Just one drop would make someone extremely agitated.

The thought of Christina being humiliated in front of everyone, her reputation destroyed, filled Missy with a twisted sense of satisfaction.

She wasn't so arrogant now, was she?

After today, let's see how Christina could still act high and mighty!

###chapter 161  Drugged

Jennifer had already slipped the temp worker some cash for the day. Wearing a mask and gloves, he brought the soup to the surveillance room, where Missy quickly added the drug.

After completing this task, the temp worker carried the tray into the banquet hall and placed the soup in front of Christina.

Everyone had the same soup, and Christina didn't suspect anyone would tamper with it at a funeral. She took a sip; it tasted good, but she wasn't really hungry.

Ralph's death had already left her feeling melancholic, and thinking about Harper from her past life only made it worse. She put down the spoon after a few sips.

"Thank you all for coming to my husband's funeral today. His greatest dream was to teach and nurture students. He gave everything to be a good teacher, and it was all worth it," Blair said into the microphone, looking at the students with a mix of sadness and gratitude.

The large turnout of students at her husband's funeral was proof of how beloved he was as a teacher. His efforts had not been in vain, and that was enough.

Christina was moved by Blair's emotions. At the same time, she felt a wave of heat rising in her body, even feeling the urge to take off her clothes.

Was the heating in the banquet hall too high, making her feel this way?

She stood up, intending to go to the restroom to splash some water on her face and clear her head.

Missy and Jennifer exchanged a glance and quickly followed her. After seeing Christina enter the restroom, they immediately messaged the temp worker to come in.

Christina stood in front of the restroom mirror, letting the cold air hit her face, then splashed cold water on her face and arms. The coolness did nothing to quell the heat inside her, and her face grew redder.

Even if she was slow to realize it, she now knew something was wrong. She had to leave immediately.

She turned off the faucet and pushed open the restroom door, only to be blocked by a middle-aged man after a few steps.

"Hey there, beautiful. Your face is so red. Need some help?" The man, who looked to be in his forties, smirked wickedly.

He even reached out to touch Christina's face.

Christina wasn't about to stand there and let him take advantage. She slapped his hand away. "Get lost!"

"Don't be so harsh, beautiful. You look like you need a man. I can satisfy you, show you what real pleasure is," the man said, his words growing more vulgar.

He knew Christina had been drugged and how potent the drug was. Even the most virtuous woman couldn't resist it.

The more she resisted now, the more she would scream in pleasure later.

"I suggest you back off. This is a hotel, and there are cameras everywhere. I can call the police and charge you with sexual harassment. You'll face legal consequences," Christina warned sternly.

The man responded with a dismissive laugh.

Sure, the hotel had cameras, but he knew better than Christina where they were positioned. The restroom entrance was a blind spot, and the cameras on the ceiling were too far to capture audio.

With Christina drugged, he could easily claim she had seduced him. What could she do then?

"If you won't cooperate, I'll just rape you here and now. You'll learn the price of messing with me!" He reached for Christina's clothes.

Christina fought back with all her might.

If she hadn't been drugged, she could have easily handled this creep, even taking on three men at once. But the drug left her weak and powerless.

"Is that all you've got? You women are all the same. I tried to be nice, but you forced me to get rough," the man taunted, growing more brazen.

Finally, someone approached.

Christina initially thought to call for help, but when she saw Missy's face, her sense of foreboding deepened.

Missy shouted, "Christina, how could you be so shameless? This is a funeral, and you're seducing a man here! Are you that desperate?"

"You two are in this together," Christina stated, not as a question but as a fact.

Anyone normal would have asked if she needed help or quietly walked away, not immediately accuse her like Missy did.

Missy sneered.

They were indeed in cahoots, but did Christina have any proof?

With the drug in her system, Christina was at their mercy.

"That's not how it looks. You're the one pulling an older man around at a funeral. Did anyone force you?" Missy raised her voice even more.

Others were drawn by the commotion, including the hotel manager.

"Please, call an ambulance. I need to go to the hospital. I've been drugged. And call the police. I want to press charges," Christina said, barely able to stand.

She dug her nails into her palm to stay conscious enough to make her request clear.

Missy panicked.

If the police got involved and investigated, they were done for.

The man was even more anxious. He had been promised money and a free pass with a young woman, not a trip to jail. His life would be ruined.

###chapter 162 Besieged

Having a criminal record would affect three generations. His son and daughter-in-law would never stop blaming him, and they might even disown him.

"Are you kidding me? You were the one coming on to me, bragging about all your tricks. Now that your friends are here, you're denying it? Trying to blackmail me?" The old man flipped the script, putting all the blame on Christina.

Christina felt like she was going to throw up.

"You're old enough to be my dad. Even if I were blind, I wouldn't go for you!"

Sure, people have different tastes, but there's a limit. No one has a taste for ugliness.

What would a young woman like her want with an old man?

Everyone else looked at Christina, then at the wrinkled old man, and had the same thought.

"Aren't you the new temp worker?" The hotel manager finally recognized the old man.

A college girl seducing a new temp worker? Not even a novel would write that.

Everyone's sympathy shifted towards Christina.

The old man then pulled out a set of car keys from his waist. "I don't need money. I just got bored at home and wanted to find something to do. She saw my car keys and tried to seduce me. I wouldn't touch her with a ten-foot pole. Who knows how many men she's been with? She's a slut!"

"Christina, how could you do this to William?" Jennifer joined the group of classmates.

She was secretly thrilled but didn't show it. Her face was full of concern. "If you're in trouble, you can talk to us. We're all your classmates. We'll help you. You don't have to degrade yourself."

"Cut the crap," Missy rolled her eyes dramatically.

She seemed to be mocking Jennifer for playing the good guy, but every word was aimed at Christina.

"She stole your fiancé. How can you still defend her?"

"Missy, we're all classmates. Let's not make this ugly. The past is the past. No need to bring it up." Jennifer hurried to stop her. "I've moved on, really."

"You're so forgiving. I can't do that. I can't stand her seducing men. She was so smug when she stole your fiancé. Now that William dumped her, she's after old men." Missy and Jennifer played off each other.

To them, Christina was a gold digger who would do anything for money.

Everyone's view of Christina changed.

Some even started whispering.

"You never really know someone. She looks so innocent."

"I thought something was off. No man would dare harass her in a hotel. It takes two to tango."

"There are so many people here. Why is she the only one with a problem?"

"Shut up!" Tony couldn't take it anymore.

He didn't believe Christina was like that. Plus, it was Ralph's memorial, and he had invited Christina. He felt responsible for protecting his classmate.

He snapped at the gossipers, "You don't know the whole story. How can you blame the victim? If it were your sister or daughter, would you say the same?"

"Tony, no need to play the hero. She doesn't care about you. We're classmates, and I don't want to see you get fooled." Missy kept stirring the pot.

She made Tony sound like a lovesick fool. He was furious. "Are you crazy?"

"I'm not wrong. Look at Christina. She's still clinging to that old man. She says one thing and does another. Only you believe her." Missy pointed ahead.

She calculated that the drug would take full effect soon, and Christina would start stripping in front of everyone.

Then Jennifer could post the video online, and Christina would be ruined.

But Christina hadn't finished the soup. She only had a few sips, so the drug wasn't as strong.

She was unsteady on her feet, her face flushed like a ripe apple, and she couldn't speak.

If she opened her mouth, she'd moan, which would be too embarrassing.

"Fine, you're not bad-looking. I'll take you." The old man thought Christina was too weak to resist.

He figured he could drag her away without a fight.

Just then, William arrived. He walked over and scooped Christina up.

"Who are you? She's mine! Put her down!" The old man was shocked by William's sudden appearance.

He hadn't even tasted Christina yet, and now William was taking her away. All his recording equipment would go to waste.

He reached out to grab her back.

William kicked him to the ground. "When did my fiancée become your woman?"

"William, I saw..." Jennifer tried to say something, but William cut her off.

"I don't want to hear it," he said coldly.

Jennifer felt a sharp pain in her heart.

He had seen Christina with another man, an old, disgusting man, yet he still hadn't given up on her.

She couldn't understand it.

Did Christina cast a spell on him?

Missy didn't dare speak either.

She could be snarky to Christina, but she was scared of William.

The old man was the only one still shouting. He didn't know who William was and didn't respect him. "You're her fiancé? Your wife was practically stripping for me. How can you defend her? Are you that shameless?"

"If I were you, I'd be too ashamed to show my face. See these car keys? Lamborghini!"

###chapter 163  My Business Is None of Your Concern

The older man wasn't content with just talking; he took the keys from his belt and dangled them in front of William. "This car's worth a few million bucks. Your wife couldn't take her eyes off these keys. If you step aside now, I might even throw some cash your way."

In the older man's mind, a Lamborghini worth millions was something most people could only dream of owning in their lifetime.

Maybe this William guy would be tempted by the money and willingly give up Christina.

The next second, William pointed outside. "That car out there is mine."

"Your junker? How much could that be worth? I've never even seen it on the streets. It's probably some old clunker."

"Lamborghini limited edition."

The older man stopped mid-sentence.

He instinctively looked at Missy, his eyes nearly popping out of his head.

If he had known William drove a Lamborghini, he wouldn't have said a word!

He stammered, unable to get a single word out.

William helped him out. "I'm from the Cavendish family. My wife is Mrs. Cavendish. She has more luxury cars in our garage than she can drive. Do you really think she'd be impressed by your Lamborghini?"

Whether he actually had a Lamborghini or not, it didn't matter. Christina would never leave a wealthy, handsome man for an old guy like him.

Even if she was a gold digger, she wasn't stupid. She'd compare her options.

The people who had just been accusing Christina of being a gold digger all fell silent, their faces burning with shame.

They had no idea it would turn out like this!

"I'll make sure this matter is thoroughly investigated. None of you are getting away with this," William said, carrying Christina out.

As he passed the hotel manager, he stopped. "Your hotel better give me an explanation, or I won't hesitate to invest in your competitors."

With his financial power, buying out the hotel wouldn't be difficult.

But buying it out would be too easy on them.

Investing in their competitors would be better, making them take a hard fall, maybe even go bankrupt. The manager would lose his job, and with a failed hotel on his resume, who would hire him?

"Mr. Cavendish, don't worry. I'll check the surveillance footage and notify the police right away. We'll make sure your wife gets justice," the manager apologized profusely, bowing so low he nearly touched the ground.

The onlookers, not wanting to get involved, quickly dispersed.

Before leaving, Tony told Missy, "I saw everything that happened. When the police arrive, I'll be a witness and tell them the truth."

They were all adults. She had slandered Christina, and if William hadn't arrived in time, who knows what would have happened.

She should face legal consequences.

"What does this have to do with me? Why are you targeting me?" Missy was furious.

Christina was supposed to be the one in trouble.

But now, Christina was being taken away by William, unscathed, while she was the one facing consequences.

The older man, who had collapsed on the ground, was even more furious. He hadn't managed to harass a college student but had instead offended someone he couldn't afford to.

He got up angrily and charged at Missy, shoving her to the ground and slapping her face. "You tricked me! I'll beat you to death!"

"Let go of me! Security, help!" Missy was terrified, crying and struggling.

But her frail body was no match for the enraged older man.

She could only weakly hit him, "Let go of me. This is illegal. The police will arrest you."

"Weren't you using me just now? Why didn't you say it was illegal when you had me bully someone else?" The older man was seeing red.

William wouldn't let him off. His life was over, so Missy, the instigator, shouldn't get away either.

He tore at Missy's clothes and bit her all over.

The slimy feeling was driving Missy to the brink of collapse.

She had fantasized about her boyfriend countless times. Even if he wasn't as outstanding as William, he should at least be middle-class, decent-looking, and loving.

Not this disgusting old man with a bad smell!

She had found him to disgust Christina, wanting to see Christina submit to an old man. But now, it was happening to her.

Jennifer was nearby.

"Jennifer, help me, please," Missy begged, but Jennifer was walking away.

In this situation, Jennifer was distancing herself. She wouldn't stay and share the trouble.

What if the old man turned on Jennifer?

Missy could only cry out in despair. Finally, hotel security arrived, several of them pulling the old man off her.

Her clothes were nearly torn off, barely covering her.

Staring at the ceiling, Missy wished she could die.

Meanwhile, Christina was being driven to the hospital by William.

After passing a couple of traffic lights, Christina told him, "Stop the car."

"Why? Are you getting out? Christina, even if you're mad, there should be a limit," William was exasperated.

She was in such a state, not just flushed but with a seductive voice.

How could she be seen like this?

"I'll call a cab to the hospital. I don't need you," Christina would rather fight the drug's effects alone than stay with him.

Just seeing his face reminded her of everything that happened when she lost her memory.

It made her sick!

She had spent time with someone she hated, picking out wedding dresses, looking at rings, even whispering sweet nothings at night.

She wanted to kill her past self and William. "You're a disgusting man who takes advantage of others. Who knows what you'll do if I stay with you?"

She was already drugged. If William took advantage again, she wouldn't be able to resist.

###chapter 164  Is There a Difference Between You Two?

"Christina!" William was at a loss for words. "I'm not as bad as you think. You know the way. I'm driving you to the hospital because you need treatment."

"I told you to stop the car. I'll call a cab myself. I've got my memory back and I know who I am now," Christina insisted, standing her ground.

They were at a stalemate.

William's heart ached. "If you hate me so much, why did you come with me earlier?"

"In that situation, if I didn't go with you, wouldn't I have been in danger? But now, the biggest danger to me is you," Christina said bluntly.

She had indeed used William just now.

But so what?

Hadn't he taken advantage of her amnesia to satisfy his own desires?

If he could deceive her like a fool, then it was only fair for her to use him once. "Don't make me say it a third time. Stop the car."

Instead of stopping, William locked the car doors. "Even if you say it three hundred times, I'm not stopping. We're going to the hospital first."

He would rather have Christina hate him, curse him, even call him despicable. He could accept that.

The most important thing now was to get her to a doctor and ensure she was healthy.

Christina grew angrier at his attitude.

Why did he always have to be the one in control?

"Don't even think about grabbing the steering wheel. There are so many cars on the road; we could crash at any moment. I know you wish I were dead, but you're carrying a child now. Her name is Harper. You have to think about the baby," William said, knowing what she cared about most.

He had no other leverage over Christina except Harper.

"Don't worry, I value my life," Christina said, though she had considered jumping out of the car.

But that was just a fleeting thought.

She wasn't stupid. She had been given a second chance and was determined to live well. She wouldn't give up her life easily.

Besides, she had Harper.

As William said, even for the sake of the child, she had to live and be strong.

"Besides, if we're in the same car, we'll die together. I can accept many ways of dying, but not with you. I'd rather go to hell."

"I'd be happy to die on the same day, month, and year as you. After all, we're married," William said sincerely.

He could never forget how Christina looked in her wedding dress.

That feeling of love at first sight was indescribable.

He truly wanted to be her husband. Now that they had a child, they could live happily as a family.

"Go die far away from me. Don't come near," Christina said, feeling a wave of disgust.

How was he any different from that old man earlier?

He was just younger and more handsome, but essentially the same.

"You think it's great, huh? I was like a fool, knowing nothing, played by you. You got a wife and a kid, and in society's eyes, you're all set. But what about me? Did you ever think about what I wanted?"

She hated William. She'd give up a lot just to get away from him.

She had made that clear.

But William, driven by his selfish desires, had deceived her, including her family. Everyone had lied to her.

Except Walter.

But in her condition, Walter had no chance to tell her the truth and could only watch her be deceived.

Thinking about it made Christina furious.

"Let's get you to the doctor first. You can settle the score with me afterward," William said, falling silent.

He drove quietly.

Christina kept the window open, letting the wind blow on her face, pinching her leg to stay awake.

If she closed her eyes, the heat would return. She didn't want to become a slave to drugs and desire.

Finally, the car stopped outside the hospital.

Christina pushed the door open and got out, almost falling as her feet hit the ground.

William caught her and lifted her into his arms.

"Put me down!" Christina struggled immediately.

She didn't want him holding her.

William, strong and determined, didn't let her go. Her struggles were like a tickle to him.

He carried her to the emergency room. "My wife might have taken something she shouldn't have. She's pregnant, and I'm worried about the effects on her and the baby."

"Right away, sir. I'll get the doctor," the nurse said, taking it seriously.

Soon, the doctor rushed over and took Christina into the examination room.

William waited anxiously.

He had only one thought: to ensure Christina and Harper were safe.

They were both crucial to him. Nothing could happen to them.

Finally, the doctor came out. "Are you the patient's husband?"

William nodded.

"Your wife was drugged. This drug isn't available on the market, but the dose was small, so it won't harm her. But you need to be careful. Don't let her eat anything suspicious, especially when dining out," the doctor advised.

He had seen many similar cases in the emergency room.

Some patients had taken large doses, causing irreversible damage even after treatment.

Such effects could last a lifetime and must be taken seriously.

"I understand," William said, feeling a wave of relief.

Luckily, Christina was okay. Otherwise, he could never forgive himself.

"What about the baby, doctor?"

"The baby is fine. I also did a prenatal checkup. Everything is good. Because of the pregnancy, some medications can't be used, so the treatment will be slower."

William finally relaxed.

After thanking the doctor, he went to see Christina. Hearing the door open, she looked up and immediately turned away when she saw him.

"I have nothing to say to you. Just leave."

###chapter 165  Can You Be a Little More Honest?

"Hey Christina, you feeling any better?" William asked, hesitating at the door.

He couldn't shake the worry gnawing at him.

Even though she wasn't exactly warm towards him, he stayed. He moved closer to her bed. "I talked to the doctor earlier. You didn't take much of the meds, and since you got help fast, it won't have any lasting effects."

"Okay," Christina replied, her tone icy.

She grabbed the cup from the nightstand and said, "You've said your piece. Can you leave now?"

She really didn't want him around, not even for a second, and definitely didn't want to share the same space with him.

She wished William would get the hint.

In their past life, he had despised her, never showing her any kindness, wishing she would vanish from his life forever.

Now that she had managed that in this life, why was he hanging around? Was he out of his mind?

"I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here with you." William hadn't even finished his sentence when Christina hurled the cup of water at him.

William reacted quickly, stepping back just in time to dodge the cup.

The cup shattered on the floor, sending shards and hot water everywhere, most of it splashing onto him. He had never been in such a sorry state before!

Christina still wasn't satisfied.

A little burn from hot water was nothing compared to the pain she had endured before. It was insignificant.

"Christina, are you calm now?" William asked, looking at the wet patch on his suit jacket.

This was the first time anyone had dared to throw something at him, and the culprit was acting like it was no big deal.

And there was nothing he could do about Christina right now.

Christina didn't think she had done anything wrong. She even picked up the kettle. "If you don't want me to throw this next, you'd better leave."

William, afraid she might burn herself, grabbed her wrist and forcibly took the kettle from her, placing it back on the table.

He hadn't even done anything yet, and Christina was already fiercely resisting.

"I'm not trying to hurt you. Can you calm down?" William didn't know what to say to her. "Even if you're mad at me, you shouldn't hurt yourself."

She still had an IV in her other hand. If she kept struggling like this, the needle might break off in her hand.

Christina didn't care about any of that.

Even if she died in this hospital room today, she would never listen to William.

Just then, a nurse burst in, exclaiming, "What are you two doing?"

She hurried to Christina's bedside, calming her down while scolding William, "How can you argue with a pregnant woman and be so rough? She's still on an IV, and the blood is already backing up into the tube. If I had come any later, she might have lost the use of this hand!"

"Please get him out of here. I don't want to see him," Christina told the nurse.

"Alright, I'll be back to redo your IV in a moment."

The nurse stood up and walked over to William, her tone firm. "Sir, you need to leave. You're disrupting the patient's treatment."

She didn't care what the relationship was between William and the patient. All she knew was that his presence was causing a significant emotional disturbance.

"A pregnant woman's emotions are already unstable, especially in the early stages. If she gets too upset, it could jeopardize the pregnancy. If you don't care about her, at least care about the baby."

This convinced William.

He really wanted this baby, whether it was a boy or a girl, whether it was Harper or not.

For Christina's sake, he left the room.

Hearing the door close, Christina finally relaxed, no longer as tense as before.

"Ms. Windsor, doesn't your hand hurt?" The nurse winced at the sight of Christina's bruised and bloody hand.

It must have been incredibly painful for her.

Christina shook her head.

It did hurt, but as long as it got William to leave, it was worth it.

At least she didn't have to see his face or hear his disgusting words.

"You're pregnant now, so you should try to control your emotions. Getting too upset isn't good for the baby. Pregnancy hormones already affect your mood. How about I schedule a session with a therapist for you?" the nurse suggested.

"Thanks, but that's not necessary. I'm about to be discharged," Christina declined.

In her current state, no therapist could help her.

As long as William kept showing up, the memories of the past would make her seethe with anger.

"Just try to manage your emotions. Give me your other hand, and I'll redo the IV. It'll take about two more hours," the nurse said gently, trying not to hurt her.

For the next two hours, no one disturbed Christina. She lay quietly in her hospital bed.

When the IV was done, she wanted to check out, but was told she couldn't.

"Ms. Windsor, Mr. Cavendish has already paid for three days. Please stay and let us know if you need anything," the staff member said apologetically.

Christina wasn't having it. "If he's paid, then refund him. I'm not a minor. I have the right to check out, don't I?"

"Ms. Windsor, you're pregnant, and he's the father. Your mother also wants you to stay for a few more days for your safety," the staff explained.

Christina felt a wave of helplessness.

She didn't know whether to blame William, her mother, or the world.

Even if she forced her way out, William would find another way to bother her. She might as well stay.

Staying in the hospital didn't mean she had to stay in the room. She could still go out, and the nurses could help keep William away.

"Fine, I'll stay for three days," Christina said, turning to leave.

"Thank you for understanding, Ms. Windsor," the staff member said gratefully.

If Christina had insisted on leaving, it would have been a real problem.

Back in her room, Christina had just sat down when her phone rang. Who could be calling at this hour?

###chapter 166  So This Was a Chain Plot

"Please don't tell me it's that annoying William again," Christina thought, feeling a wave of irritation wash over her. She grabbed her phone from the bedside table and glanced at the screen.

The caller ID showed it was Mia.

Her frown immediately softened, and she answered the call as quickly as she could. "Hey, Mia! Sorry for the delay with your renovation plans."

If it hadn't been for the car accident, she would have already completed the design plans for Mia's properties by now.

Given the delay, Christina didn't expect Mia to wait for her indefinitely. She assumed Mia had probably handed the project over to another designer.

"Christina? Is that really you?" Mia's voice was a mix of surprise and joy. "We were supposed to meet that day, but you never showed up. I tried calling you, but couldn't get through. I thought I'd try again today. Have you been okay? Did something happen?"

"I had a car accident on my way to meet you and lost my memory. I couldn't remember anything until recently," Christina explained briefly.

Mia's eyes widened in shock.

She had suspected something had happened to Christina, as it was unlike her to not answer calls. But hearing the confirmation still startled her. "Christina, did you investigate the driver? I'm worried this wasn't an accident but someone trying to harm you." Mia's concern stemmed from her own experience.

Her closest confidant, her husband, had plotted to kill her. If it hadn't been for Christina's friend, they both might have died that day.

Mia feared Christina might be a target too. "I think you should look into it. If it was an accident, it's just a bit of time wasted. But if someone is out to get you, at least you'll be prepared."

"I know, thank you." Christina also found the two accidents suspiciously coincidental.

If William hadn't saved her the first time, she would have been the one hit.

Could she really be that unlucky?

Maybe Mia was right. Someone might be plotting against her, trying to take her life.

"We're good friends, and we've been through a lot together. No need to be so formal. Are you still in the hospital? How about I come visit you?" Mia didn't mention the renovation at all.

She had already halted all the renovation work and was staying with her daughter at her mother's house, a spacious three-story villa. They had plenty of room, and she didn't want to pressure Christina while she was recovering.

Christina thought for a moment. "Let's meet outside. I could use some fresh air."

"Sure, I'll find a nice hotel nearby, and we can meet there," Mia agreed readily.

After hanging up, she booked a room at a nearby five-star hotel and drove to the neighboring community.

She had a key to Alex's place and let herself in without knocking. "Alex, stop playing your game and get ready to go out."

"I'm not just playing games; I'm working hard to pay next month's rent and groceries," Alex replied without looking up, his eyes glued to his phone screen. "Respect my profession. I'm an esports player!"

"Yeah, right. Real esports players make tens of thousands a month. How much do you make?" Mia retorted bluntly. "I bet you struggle to make even ten grand a month."

Her words hit Alex hard.

He hadn't even made ten thousand this month; his total earnings were only about eight thousand.

"But you can't compare me to you. Compared to my peers, I'm doing well. Many people don't make as much as I do," he argued.

He had seen job listings where college graduates earned only three or four thousand a month. His earnings were double that.

Mia was exasperated. "Do you know how much was spent on your education? And you're at an age where you should be thinking about marriage. Can you support a family on your current salary?"

She pointed out that even Christina, who hadn't graduated yet, earned more than him.

"I get it. Are you trying to set me up again?" Alex's face showed more frustration. "Last time, you said you had a great match for me, but she never showed up."

He had been puzzled then but now realized it was part of a plan to push him.

"You're worse than my parents. You must have been a hitman in a past life to be this ruthless."

Mia couldn't help but laugh. "Do you really think I'm that kind of person? Relax, I'm not that petty. She had a car accident on her way to meet you last time. She's better now, and I'm here to take you to meet her."

"Really?" Alex was skeptical but figured Mia wouldn't lie about something like this.

He finished his game and put down his phone. "I'll get ready. Give me a minute."

Men didn't need much time to get ready. A quick change of clothes and a splash of water on his face, and he was done.

Soon, they were on their way to the hotel.

They had just sat down in the private room when the door opened, and Christina walked in, dressed in professional attire. "I hope I'm not late."

###chapter 167 Very Nice to Meet You

Alex was floored the moment he saw her.

He'd heard Mia talk about Christina before and already had a good impression. But meeting her in person today, he finally got what love at first sight really meant.

Turns out, love at first sight isn't just a thing in novels; it actually happens in real life.

"Christina Windsor, this is my cousin Alex Wilson. We grew up together," Mia introduced them.

Christina didn't think much of it.

She extended her hand to Alex. "Nice to meet you."

"Nice to meet you too, Christina. You look amazing," Alex quickly reached out to shake her hand.

Mia watched from the side, smiling silently.

Once they were seated, she took out her phone and texted Alex: [At least try to be subtle. You looked like you were about to glue your eyes to her.]

[Please, you have to put in a good word for me. If I can be with her, I'll do anything you say for the rest of my life.] Alex replied instantly.

He was on cloud nine, willing to do anything to make this relationship work.

Mia stifled a laugh: [What if I say you're not trying hard enough? Will you listen?]

[Of course! Love is like tending to a flower. If I don't have the means, how can I take care of such a beautiful flower? Besides, she's so amazing. I can't just sit at home playing video games all day.] Alex felt a surge of motivation.

Mia glanced at her phone, then at Alex, and couldn't help but burst into laughter.

"Christina," Mia said, putting her phone down and turning to her. "What are your plans next?"

"I haven't decided yet. I need to focus on getting better first," Christina sighed.

All her plans had been disrupted by this unexpected pregnancy.

Logic told her to terminate the pregnancy and cut ties with William.

But emotionally, she couldn't bring herself to do it.

This child could very well be Harper. She hadn't protected Harper in her past life. Could she really deny Harper the chance to see the world in this life?

Logic and emotion were like two ropes pulling her in opposite directions, causing her immense pain and making it hard to decide.

"You're right. Nothing is more important than your health. Now that you're out of the hospital, we should meet up more often. I still need your help with some design work," Mia said, trying to create opportunities for Alex.

The more they met, the more familiar they would become.

Christina felt a warm current in her heart. "I thought you had found another designer."

After all, they hadn't been in touch for a long time.

Strictly speaking, she had breached their agreement.

"Of course not. We work so well together. My daughter loves the jungle-themed room you designed. She even bought a fur costume and jumps around the room. She's so lively," Mia said, her eyes softening as she talked about her daughter.

"I don't have high expectations for her. I just want her to be happy every day."

"Christina, order whatever you like. This meal's on me," Alex said, handing the menu to her.

Christina wasn't very hungry and ordered a few dishes.

Mia and Alex each added two more dishes, then handed the menu to the waiter.

Soon, the food arrived.

This five-star hotel lived up to its reputation. Every dish looked and tasted amazing.

During the meal, Alex kept chatting with Christina and was pleasantly surprised to find they had a lot in common. "Christina, how about we add each other on social media? We can hang out sometime."

"Sure," Christina agreed readily.

She didn't think much of it, just seeing Alex as a friend.

After they finished eating, Alex offered to drive her back. "I'm a great driver. It won't be bumpy at all."

Mia watched and couldn't help but sigh.

Indeed, when a man sees a woman he likes, he becomes like a peacock showing off its feathers, eager to display his charm.

"No need. I'm still staying at the hospital, and it's not far from here. I can walk back and digest the food," Christina waved at him. "See you next time."

She didn't notice a familiar car parked by the roadside. William got out and walked briskly toward her.

"See you next time," Alex said, giving her one last look before starting the car and driving away.

Once they were a bit further, Mia couldn't help but tease him. "Tone it down a bit. Don't scare her off."

"But I really like her. I can't help it," Alex said, his mind filled with Christina's smile.

Meanwhile, Christina was about to walk back to the hospital when William grabbed her arm. A familiar voice sounded in her ear, "You're not fully recovered yet. Why did you leave the hospital, and to meet another man?"

She was so cold to him, yet she smiled so warmly at another man.

The stark contrast made William feel a pain he couldn't describe. "I know you hate me, but we have a child together."

"You know better than anyone how this child came to be. I was out of it, like a fool being deceived. To put it bluntly, what you did was illegal!" Christina was furious at the mention of it.

She could accept Harper, but she would never accept William because of Harper.

She hated deception more than anything.

"But Christina, at first, you..."

"So what? Just because we had sex doesn't mean I have to spend my life with you. This is the 21st century. Stop saying things that disgust me," Christina pushed him away. "Don't touch me. Unless you want to make a scene, I'll call the police and we'll make the news again."

She didn't care, but the Cavendish family wouldn't be able to handle it.

Especially Nicholas, with his pride. How could he tolerate the Cavendish family becoming a laughingstock again and again?

He would be furious!

###chapter 168 Confession

Christina said it on purpose, mainly to avoid wasting time with William.

"This was my mistake. You can be mad at me, but there's no need to drag Nicholas into this."

His tone was gentle, almost pleading.

But Christina was unmoved. She shot him a cold glance before turning and walking into the hospital.

William wanted to follow, but Christina suddenly turned back, making him stop in his tracks. His eyes were filled with guilt and worry.

"Don't follow me. I can't rest with you around." With that, Christina strode inside.

Watching her leave, William opened his mouth but said nothing. He sighed, watching her until she entered the ward, then turned to leave.

Christina, however, felt uneasy after returning.

But she had made up her mind. The child was innocent. In her past life, Harper never got to see the world properly, partly because she misjudged people.

This time was different. She had the ability to protect her child and wouldn't let the same problems happen again.

With that thought, Christina took out her laptop and got back to work.

Over the next few days, Christina continued to rest in the hospital, but William kept bringing food.

"Don't think that doing this will move me. It just makes me not want to eat at all."

So, William didn't dare deliver the food himself, instead having someone else bring it in.

Christina was harsh with her words and didn't want to see William again.

But she didn't refuse the food. After all, she was newly pregnant and needed to take care of herself.

She accepted all the food William sent.

After a few days, she was discharged from the hospital.

Back home, Christina threw herself into her work.

She had hope now, and everything felt more motivating.

One day, Christina received a message from Alex.

"Christina, are you free lately? I have a design detail I don't quite understand and wanted to ask you about it. If you have time, could you come over? I'd like to discuss it with you."

Seeing the message, Christina thought of the cheerful, sunny boy.

Plus, Mia had always supported her, so Christina felt comfortable around them and agreed.

"Sure, I'll come over soon."

Hearing that Christina was coming, Alex quickly tidied up and asked the waiter about the best-rated drinks at the café.

After preparing everything, Christina arrived.

"Why are you here so early?"

Christina noticed his coffee was almost finished.

"No, I've been here for a while. I thought it might be a bit inconvenient for you, but Mia said you're good at this."

Alex's expression was different from usual when he saw Christina.

He was even a bit shy, speaking more sincerely.

He had rehearsed these words beforehand.

He didn't really want to talk about work.

He just wanted to see her. He had even asked Mia how to find common topics with Christina.

Though they got along well, he was still nervous and wanted to get closer.

Mia had mentioned that Christina might not be interested in other things, but she wouldn't refuse to talk about work since she was a workaholic.

After much thought, Alex came up with this plan.

But he hadn't expected Christina to actually come.

"So, you like this design too. Let me take a look."

Christina took his design plan, glanced at it, and pointed out some issues.

"Of course, this is just my opinion. If you think something's off, we can discuss it. I think you might just need someone to talk it over with."

"Yeah, I think adding a corner here would be better, but it makes other areas look awkward."

Alex had some insights but not as deep.

Since realizing he liked Christina, he felt it wasn't too late to try harder.

They had a great conversation, both smiling.

But outside the café, someone was fuming.

It was Amara Spencer, who had been pursuing Alex.

"Why?"

"Why don't you like me? Now you're with someone like Christina, and you said you weren't interested in dating. What is this?"

Amara had tried to be like Alex.

She learned to play games and did many things Alex liked.

But she only got his disinterest and warnings to stay away.

She had thought Alex just didn't understand dating, but now it was clear he just wasn't interested in her.

Thinking this made Amara furious.

Alex wanted to say more, but his phone rang.

"Okay, I'll be right back."

He hesitated. He really didn't want to leave now.

Even though they were just talking about work, he was happy to be alone with Christina.

But the person on the phone was insistent, so he had no choice but to agree.

After hanging up, he looked at Christina apologetically.

"Sorry, I have to go back to the office for a bit."

"No problem, go ahead. If you ever need help, just ask me."

Christina was quite straightforward.

Alex, affected by her smile, almost walked into the doorframe on his way out.

He left, still in a daze.

Christina sat in the café for a while before heading back to the office.

Amara watched her leave, seething.

"Maybe they're really just talking about work."

"Yeah, if Alex hasn't accepted your feelings, he probably won't easily like someone else."

Amara's friends tried to reassure her.

But Amara felt Alex was different with Christina.

She had investigated Christina's background but only knew the basics, not the details.

In the following days, Alex kept asking Christina to meet whenever he had free time.

Though they always talked about work, Christina didn't mind and even felt it helped her improve.

But Alex grew more uneasy.

Finally, one day, he brought out flowers he had prepared and placed them in front of her.

"Christina, I like you. Will you be my girlfriend?"

They had just finished discussing work, and this sudden change left Christina stunned.

"What?"

Christina replied, still in shock.

"Sorry, I know this is impulsive, but I really like you. Can you give me a chance?"

###chapter 169 Strange Scene

Amara happened to witness the whole scene.

She had just come by on a whim, but she didn't expect to run into Alex and Christina again.

And this time, she clearly heard Alex's confession.

"I'm serious. I hope you'll consider it."

Alex was charmed by Christina's adorable silence.

After all, Christina's current dazed look was quite different.

"Thanks for liking me, but I'm not looking to start a relationship right now..."

Christina's words were abruptly cut off by Amara, who suddenly appeared.

"So you're the one, huh?"

"You're the one trying to steal Alex, right?"

Alex was startled by Amara's sudden appearance.

"What are you doing here?"

Alex looked at Amara with some displeasure.

But Amara, in a fit of rage, pushed Alex behind her and glared angrily at Christina.

"You won't be with me because of her?"

"She doesn't even look that great, and she has no redeeming qualities. Why do you like her and not me?"

Christina was stunned by Amara's aggressive demeanor.

Before she could react, Amara grabbed a cup of coffee from the table and threw it at Christina.

Christina instinctively closed her eyes as coffee splattered everywhere.

"If you're going to play dumb, I'll make you wake up."

Amara's voice was excessively sharp.

Her actions quickly drew the attention of others.

Christina was genuinely shocked.

She hadn't expected Amara to actually get physical.

"Is that so? Thanks for the wake-up call."

Christina grabbed another cup of coffee from the table.

Though she was pregnant and couldn't drink coffee, Alex had already ordered it when they arrived.

Every time they left, there was always a lot of coffee left.

She had planned to tell Alex that next time they came to the café, there was no need to order coffee, as it was wasteful.

But now, it seemed it wasn't entirely wasted.

Christina threw the coffee at Amara's face with more force than Amara had used.

"If you don't understand, go check the surveillance footage."

"Alex and I are just friends. As for his confession, I was stunned. Isn't it normal? Who can handle someone suddenly confessing to them while discussing work?"

If it were any other matter, Christina might have explained a bit.

But now, she wouldn't waste time on someone irrelevant.

Christina turned to Alex.

"Because you're Mia's brother, and Mia and I are good friends, and you have a good personality."

"You always asked me out for work, so I agreed."

"What I didn't finish saying earlier is that I'm not interested in you. If it's just as friends, fine, but anything else is out of the question. And I really dislike this kind of behavior."

Christina, covered in coffee, looked coldly at Alex.

Alex's expression was at its worst.

He hadn't expected his carefully planned confession to be ruined.

"What's wrong with you?"

"Why are you here again? I've rejected you clearly before. Why do you keep doing this and accusing others of seduction?"

Alex was genuinely angry at Amara. If it were any other situation, he might have had an explanation.

But today, he had no way out, especially with Christina's beautiful face showing anger.

He felt nothing but guilt.

Amara, being scolded by both of them, was about to explode with anger.

"You're lying. You accepted the food I gave you before, which means you accepted my confession. And Mia said we were a good match."

Hearing this, Alex couldn't help but roll his eyes.

"Mia thinks everyone is nice. She said we were a good match because she found you annoying."

"I didn't want to be too harsh, but I didn't expect you to be so spoiled."

Alex had never spoken so harshly before.

Even when he was really annoyed, he would just say not to come again, that he didn't like it.

But the more he said that, the more determined Amara became.

But today, Amara seemed to have lost her mind.

Christina, watching the two of them go crazy, had no interest in dealing with their drama.

After saying what she needed to, she felt calm again.

After all, when she was discharged from the hospital, the doctor had warned her to avoid emotional fluctuations to ensure the baby's healthy development.

So, no matter what happened, Christina tried to stay calm.

But she was genuinely angry just now.

After all, she had suffered such injustice and undeserved accusations because of someone irrelevant.

"It's all because of you. Alex treats me like this because of you. We were fine before, but everything changed when you came along."

Christina was about to leave.

But Amara, like a madwoman, charged at Christina, ready to get physical.

Christina prepared to defend herself.

No matter what, she wouldn't let Amara succeed.

"Stop it."

Alex was startled by Amara's actions and quickly pulled her back.

"How much more embarrassing do you want to be? I didn't want to be too harsh because we knew each other, but Christina is someone I respect. Don't make this harder for me."

Alex was truly exasperated.

He had always believed that liking someone meant giving them the best and striving to improve himself.

As long as he became better, he would be worthy of standing by her side.

He had thought that even if Christina didn't accept his confession today, he would keep trying.

At least Christina would know his determination.

But now, everything was ruined by Amara.

"What are you talking about? We had a chance."

Christina watched the two of them argue and had no interest in talking to them anymore.

"If you have work-related matters, go to the office and find someone else. I don't have time right now."

Christina, covered in coffee stains, grabbed her bag and walked past Alex, coldly saying this.

Then she walked away.

Watching Christina leave, Alex was devastated.

"Are you happy now?"

"What do you want? How many times have I rejected you? Do you have to make everyone as miserable as you?"

After Christina left, she didn't go to the office. She went home, took a shower, changed her clothes, and only then went back to work.

Because of this incident, Christina realized there was no need to compromise. She had only met with Alex because of Mia.

She had thought he was genuinely seeking advice, but it had completely gone off track.

###chapter 170  Considered a Chance Encounter

Christina took a deep breath and pushed those unrealistic thoughts out of her mind. She needed to focus on her work.

Her design progress had been decent before, but various reasons had caused delays. So, Christina had to start from scratch. Thankfully, Mia hadn't given up. Christina couldn't even imagine what would have happened otherwise.

She had just finished drawing the latest design and sent it over to Mia.

Mia replied shortly after reviewing the design, "I was just about to come find you. Are you free?"

"I'm at the office," Christina responded, continuing to work on her designs. She wanted to immerse herself in work to improve her life.

During this time, William kept calling and texting her. He wanted a response or forgiveness from Christina. But she had blocked him without even looking at his messages. There was no way she was going to reply or forgive him.

After finishing her second design, Mia arrived at the office and called Christina into her office.

"What's up?"

They were friends now, so Christina didn't use formal titles with her. She had tried once, but Mia had sternly corrected her, and they had been like sisters ever since.

"You're amazing. Truly talented people won't be overlooked, no matter what."

Christina felt a bit embarrassed by the compliment. "I was hoping you'd point out any issues."

Mia looked at the designs, growing more satisfied with each one. "No need. I think they're perfect as they are. Any more changes would be unnecessary."

Mia placed the designs on the table and pulled a file from the drawer, handing it to Christina. Christina instinctively took it and opened it, shocked by the contents.

"What's this? A stock transfer? Did you grab the wrong file?"

Mia shook her head with a smile. "No mistake. It's still early. Come with me somewhere?"

Christina checked the time. It was indeed early. She agreed to Mia's invitation, and they headed to Silver Lake Hot Springs Resort.

"Why are we here?"

"I thought you needed a break. I've heard about my brother's situation. I can't believe he can't even handle his own affairs."

Mia had hoped to set up Alex and Christina. But it had to be mutual. After all, Mia herself was a living example, and Christina clearly wasn't interested. But her naive brother Alex still thought there was hope.

"It's fine, but if something like this happens again, let's handle it at the office."

Christina didn't blame Mia. But too many incidents like this would be too much for anyone.

"It was his fault. Don't worry, Alex knows he messed up."

"Hope you're not mad."

Christina shook her head. She remembered the stock transfer document.

"That stock transfer is for you. Just a preview. I'll send you the details later," Mia explained while driving.

Christina was puzzled, looking at Mia. "You've helped me so much. I need to show my gratitude. You've put in so much effort, I feel bad."

Mia was sincere. If it were anyone else, Mia might not have been so direct. But this was different. Christina had truly helped her a lot.

Christina felt awkward. "Don't make it complicated. I was just doing what felt right. I think I helped not just you, but many women."

Christina meant that she would have helped any woman in Mia's situation.

"But you helped me. I can't ignore that just because you might help others."

They went back and forth. Christina felt a bit helpless.

"Anyway, I won't accept your stocks. If you want to give me something, make it practical."

"Spend more time with me, talk to me. What I need isn't stocks, but genuine friendship."

Mia was deeply moved. "Okay."

Just then, they arrived at their destination.

"What's this place?" Christina had noticed earlier. Mia's GPS was set to a resort. Christina thought Mia was taking her to a business meeting, but they were at Silver Lake Hot Springs Resort.

"We're here to relax in the hot springs. Don't worry about swimsuits. I've got everything covered. I noticed you've been stressed, so let's take this chance to unwind."

Mia led Christina inside. Christina felt a bit awkward. "I'm not really in the mood."

"Is it your period?"

"No worries, I have tampons..."

But Mia noticed Christina's expression. "Wait, are you...?"

Christina waved her hand. "No, it's nothing. I'll just keep you company. It's warm inside, we can chat while you soak."

Mia nodded, not pressing further. But as they reached the entrance, Mia suddenly remembered.

"Are you pregnant? Is that why you went to the hospital? No wonder you weren't interested in my brother. You already have a baby."

Mia's teasing made Christina feel awkward. She couldn't exactly tell Mia she was reborn. But it didn't matter. Christina wanted to keep the baby, not because of anyone else, but because she wanted the child to live. Even if she wanted to cut ties with William, Christina wanted to keep the baby and live well.

"Alright, I won't push you. You need to be careful in the first few months. I won't force you."

Christina nodded awkwardly. 

Before they reached the changing area, they saw a group of people approaching.

 One person stood out, tall and well-dressed. 

Christina recognized him immediately. William and his group noticed them too. 

When he looked up, his eyes met Christina's. Seeing her, he instinctively walked over. He didn't bother explaining to anyone. 

Seeing William approach, Christina instinctively stepped back. 

Mia, being sharp, noticed the tension between them. But when she realized it was William, she was still a bit shocked.

###chapter 171 Unmoved

Mia's eyes darted between Christina and William.

Eventually, Mia instinctively tried to blend into the background.

William's group did the same.

They were curious, but they knew some things were better left alone.

For some reason, the moment Christina saw William, she instinctively wanted to retreat.

So she just turned around, waved at Mia, and headed to the lounge area.

William quickly followed her.

"Hey, don't get the wrong idea. I'm here for work. You saw those people with their dates. I don't have one."

Christina found his explanation amusing.

"Why are you telling me this? I told you before, what you do is none of my business."

William's expression turned somber at her words.

If Christina had yelled, screamed, questioned, or shown jealousy, he would have been happy.

But seeing her indifferent gaze felt like a needle piercing his heart, leaving him at a loss for words.

"By the way, we haven't seen each other in a few days. You used to love cats, right? I had someone get you one of the breeds you liked."

"And dogs too. If you want a specific kind, we can get one. Whatever you want."

His tone was gentle, his attitude humble.

He was much taller than Christina, and he deliberately lowered his head to speak to her.

From the side, it looked like someone in a position of power trying hard to please someone below them.

But to Christina, it was a joke.

"Don't you think it's funny? Telling me now that you'll get me pets. I had so many before, and what happened to them?"

Christina had once hoped, but the results always disappointed her.

Whether it was pets or children.

Even the scenes she genuinely loved were trivial to William.

They became a joke to gain sympathy.

Thinking of this, Christina's previously calm mood sank again.

She turned around.

William wanted to follow, but remembering what Christina had said, he stopped.

"What's going on?"

The group with William, curious, approached.

"Did you upset your wife? Women need surprises. Just make it up to her."

Listening to them, William forced a smile.

The issues between him and Christina were far more complicated.

Not something that could be resolved with a few words.

But he knew they meant well.

"Thanks. Let's call it a day."

Their business was mostly settled. He was just accompanying some partners to relax. He had been thinking about how to get closer to Christina.

Now that they had seen her, it was a good excuse to leave.

Christina left the resort and messaged Mia.

"Sorry, I can't join you at the hot springs today. I'm not in a good mood."

Mia quickly replied.

"Don't overthink it. If you need anything, just let me know. I've been through it, so I understand."

Christina gave a bitter smile at her phone and didn't reply. She hailed a cab home.

When she got back, she saw a small figure pacing in the living room.

It was a tiny, cream-colored kitten. As Christina got closer, she saw it was a little kitten.

Seeing the kitten, Christina's expression softened.

In her past life, she had a silver tabby cat.

The kitten was soft and cute, keeping her company during countless moments of helplessness.

Later, by chance, she found a puppy.

She thought having a cat, a dog, and eventually a child, despite the issues with William, would be fine.

But everything fell apart.

As Christina reminisced, the kitten licked her hand, melting her heart.

William watched from the second floor. He hadn't seen that expression on Christina in a long time.

His heart began to soften.

After hesitating, he came down with a Dalmatian puppy.

"I remember you said you liked this breed."

Christina didn't take the puppy, just looked at William coldly.

"What's your goal here?"

"To please me? To make me forget the past, or to make me treat you like before?"

Her face was now cold.

Her earlier smile was fleeting.

"I know. I don't expect you to forgive me quickly, but I'll try."

He struggled to say the words.

Christina couldn't help but laugh.

But it was a mocking laugh.

"What are you trying for? To make me relive those 'wonderful' memories?" Christina emphasized the word "wonderful."

William's expression grew more despondent.

"Don't waste your time. Was it you who invited me to the Ferris wheel park?"

"I used to want to go. I longed for your attention, but what did you give me in return? I don't need to say it. You know."

"I don't want to repeat myself. I'll never forget Harper's death. Nothing you do will change that."

Christina thought.

That was my daughter, a part of me. I cherished her, but she couldn't compete with a word from his first love.

Thinking of this, Christina found it laughable.

"Now that you're awake, shouldn't you pursue what you didn't get before? Why waste time on me?"

"Whether this child is born or not, I don't want them to have any connection with you. Don't try to do these meaningless things."

William fell silent.

He realized that whenever they met, it was either tense or they disagreed.

They never had a peaceful moment together.

"I understand."

After a long pause, William gently placed the puppy on the ground and turned to leave.

His figure was desolate. He hoped Christina would call him back, give him a chance.

But Christina didn't. He saw her mocking and angry expression reflected in the glass.

Meanwhile, at the Cavendish Mansion, news arrived.

"Is it true?"

"Of course. It came from the hospital. How could it be fake?"

The butler handed the hospital report to Nicholas.

Nicholas quickly put on his reading glasses and read the report, finally smiling.

"Good, good, very good."

After reading the last word, he kept repeating this phrase.

###chapter 172 New Public Opinion

The butler noticed Nicholas was in high spirits, so he felt happy too.

"Yeah, this is great news."

"Are you planning to visit them?"

The butler hesitated. Christina and William hadn't lived here for a while.

Nicholas tapped his cane on the floor.

"Of course, I have to go. The birth of a grandchild is a rare and special event."

When William was born, Nicholas was already quite old. He had thought he wouldn't live to see William get married, but now there was good news so soon.

"Yes, I'll prepare some gifts for you."

"Make sure to bring the best ones suitable for a pregnant woman."

He quickly instructed the butler.

After everything was ready, the butler drove Nicholas to Christina's villa.

Although Christina and William lived together, there was a rift between them, so they rarely saw each other. William wanted to explain and make amends, but Christina always coldly shut him down.

It was the weekend, and Christina had just finished a design draft and was planning to go for a walk. As she opened the door, she saw the Cavendish Mansion's car parked outside.

"What brings you here?"

Nicholas was just getting out of the car.

"Why are you out here alone? Didn't you get a nanny to take care of you? Where's your nanny, Lisa?"

Nicholas was worried seeing Christina by herself.

Christina was puzzled.

"What's wrong? I'm perfectly fine. I don't need anyone to look after me."

Although she was unhappy with William, Christina didn't want to upset Nicholas, who was old.

"You're pregnant now. You need to be careful. The first three months are crucial. You should wait until after that to do anything."

Christina sighed after a moment of confusion.

She followed Nicholas inside. Nicholas instructed the butler to bring in all the supplements he had prepared. He then sat on the couch, and Christina sat beside him, asking Lisa to make him a cup of coffee.

"From now on, you should stay home and rest. Don't go out unless necessary. Put your work on hold until after the baby is born."

Nicholas started pointing out things in the house that were unsuitable for a pregnant woman or a baby. By the time he finished, it seemed like there was hardly anything in the villa that was safe to use.

Christina's mouth twitched as she listened. But she didn't want to upset the old man, so she nodded in agreement.

"Alright, I'll try. Besides, the doctor said I'm in good health."

Christina spoke earnestly, but Nicholas was adamant and wouldn't let her argue.

"Okay, I understand. I'll do as you say."

Christina listened to him for over half an hour before Nicholas finally left.

William had just finished his work when he heard from his assistant that Nicholas had visited Christina. He grabbed his car keys and rushed out. Although he knew Nicholas wouldn't trouble Christina, he was still worried. He remembered what Christina had said at the hospital and didn't want any issues between them.

He sped home, but by the time he arrived, Christina had already gone upstairs. Only Lisa was there, organizing the supplements Nicholas had brought.

"Where's my dad?" William asked Lisa as he tossed his keys on the table.

"Mr. Cavendish just left. Is everything okay?" Lisa replied.

William shook his head and glanced upstairs. "She's fine. Dad just brought some supplements and asked me to remove anything unsuitable for a pregnant woman from the villa," Lisa explained.

William sighed in relief. "Alright, I get it."

Christina had heard William's voice from her room.

"Don't follow his instructions to the letter. Do whatever Christina wants. Call me if there's any issue. I have to get back to work," William instructed, wanting to check on Christina but deciding to leave his concerns with Lisa due to their strained relationship.

"Okay, don't worry. I'll take good care of her," Lisa assured him.

After William left, Christina came out of her room. "I'm going out for a bit," she said, grabbing her car keys and heading out. Lisa wanted to stop her, but Christina didn't listen to either William or Nicholas. Lisa, being just a nanny, had no authority to intervene.

Feeling frustrated, Christina decided to go for a drive. She had no intention of following Nicholas's advice about staying home and not working. She wasn't living in the past.

As she drove down a busy street, she saw a familiar face.

"I told you I'm not interested. And don't you remember? I already have a child," Mia's voice was filled with exasperation, but the man in front of her was persistent.

"So what? I like you, and I will like your child too. Don't worry, I'll treat your child well."

Seeing this, Christina quickly parked her car and walked over to stand between them.

"What are you two doing?" Christina, tall and dressed in a more androgynous style today, looked quite imposing.

"I suggest you mind your own business. I'm talking to someone I like," the man retorted.

Mia, seeing Christina, grabbed her hand like she had found a savior. "Sweetheart, you're finally here. You have no idea how long this guy has been bothering me."

Christina looked at Mia in confusion, but Mia kept winking and giving her a pleading look.

Christina sighed silently and then changed her demeanor. "Didn't you hear my girlfriend? Or do you just enjoy being a pest? We worked hard to resolve our issues and be together. We don't want anything to do with a creep like you."

Christina spoke with confidence, while Mia leaned on her shoulder, playing the part of a delicate partner. "Exactly."

"I've already made it clear. I like soft, sweet girls. I'm not interested in men like you," Mia added.

Their performance made the man shiver with discomfort. His infatuation with Mia turned into confusion and unease.

"I didn't know you were into women. Don't you have a daughter? If you don't like men, why did you have a child with one?" the man asked, bewildered. Mia, however, was done with the conversation and pulled Christina away. Unexpectedly, the man, holding a grudge, exposed Mia and Christina's relationship to the public!

###chapter 173  Help Me Once, and We'll Be Even

Christina and Mia's online feud had caused quite a stir, even dragging up some of Christina's past scandals. But surprisingly, the news was quickly suppressed.

Everyone knew by now that Christina had a powerful backer-William.

Jennifer couldn't hold back any longer.

She went to Emerald Lakeside again and found Missy.

"What are you doing here?" Missy was working in the yard and her first instinct was to chase Jennifer away when she saw her.

But Jennifer had already stepped inside.

Missy had no choice but to put down her bucket and walk to the doorway, blocking Jennifer's path. "I have people at home. It's not convenient for you to come in. You should leave."

"Missy, what do you mean by this? We had an agreement. Are you planning to break it?" Jennifer frowned.

Her patience was wearing thin.

She had been in a foul mood these past few days, and Missy's refusal to cooperate was pushing her to the edge.

Missy didn't want to anger Jennifer.

But she had to think of herself too. "I don't want to go against Christina anymore. If William comes after me, I can't bear the consequences. You know my family's situation. If I had money and power, I could follow your lead."

Missy had always thought William had a special place for Jennifer, that his feelings for Christina were just a fling.

But at the funeral, Missy saw clearly how much William cared for Christina.

She was genuinely scared.

If William wanted to crush her, it would be as easy as squashing an ant.

"Missy, the temp worker from that day is already in jail. Aren't you curious why you're still safe and no one has come after you?" Jennifer sneered.

Before Missy could respond, Jennifer continued, "It's because I helped you. Without me, you'd be in jail with that temp worker, not standing here talking to me."

"I did you a huge favor, and now you want to kick me out and cut ties? Fine, then I won't bother covering for you anymore."

"What do you mean?" Missy panicked.

She had thought her recent peace was due to good luck, not realizing Jennifer had a hand in it.

Jennifer chuckled, "What do I mean? Exactly what I said. If you get it, you get it. If not, I'll leave right now."

Missy quickly grabbed her arm.

When she spoke again, her tone was pleading, "I'm helping you. You can't throw me under the bus."

"So help me one more time, and we'll be even. After that, whether you stay here or go abroad, I'll support you." Jennifer was desperate to get rid of Christina.

And she needed Missy's help to do it.

She couldn't risk doing it herself and getting caught. That would be the end of her.

William's patience with her was limited.

Missy hesitated for a long time before finally agreeing, "Fine, but this is the last time. After this, you have to send me abroad and never contact me again."

"Deal." Jennifer agreed readily.

It was just a promise. Whether she kept it would depend on her mood.

Given Missy's situation, there was no way she could escape Jennifer's grasp.

Missy stepped aside, "Let's talk inside. Tell me what you need me to do."

Jennifer followed her in, looking around disdainfully.

Missy's grandfather came out of his room and, seeing the well-dressed Jennifer, felt even more self-conscious. He forced a smile, "Hello, are you Missy's classmate?"

"Yeah," Jennifer nodded curtly, barely acknowledging him.

Missy's grandfather felt even more awkward. He glanced at his own faded, patched clothes and then at Jennifer's expensive-looking bag. He didn't know brands, but he could tell it was valuable. Meanwhile, his granddaughter Missy had to use a faded canvas bag. The contrast pained him, "Missy, I'll go back to my room. There are fruits and drinks in the fridge. Make sure to treat your guest well."

"I know, Grandpa," Missy replied.

She went to the kitchen, took out some drinks and fruits, and brought them to Jennifer. Jennifer picked up an apple, saw a blemish, and lost her appetite. She then grabbed a drink, noticing it was from last year, "This is almost expired. Why haven't you thrown it out?"

"It's not expired yet. It's still good to drink," Missy explained, "It has half a month left before it expires."

"What's the difference?" Jennifer tossed the drink back at Missy. To her, these were just trash. She wouldn't drink them even if she were paid.

Missy's lips twitched. To her, these drinks were already a luxury. Her grandfather had asked her to bring them out because he thought they were good enough for guests. But Jennifer didn't appreciate it at all.

"I don't care how you do it. Just follow Christina and find a way to get rid of her. Otherwise, you'll end up in jail and won't even have expired drinks to drink," Jennifer laid out her plan. She didn't care if William loved Christina. As long as Christina was out of the picture, all her problems would be solved.

"I understand," Missy didn't argue, "Don't forget your promise. After this, send me abroad and take care of my grandfather. Put him in a nursing home and cover all the costs."

Her grandfather had raised her, and she was deeply attached to him. She had to think about his future. If she left, she needed to ensure her grandfather was taken care of.

Jennifer's eyes narrowed, "I know."

Missy's bond with her grandfather was a leverage point.

In the following days, Missy tailed Christina. She thought she was being discreet, but William was already aware of everything. William knew Christina didn't want to see him. He didn't want to argue with her but couldn't stop worrying, so he had his assistant keep an eye on her and report any issues immediately.

"Mr. Cavendish, I've noticed someone following Ms. Windsor these past few days. They don't seem like a professional," the assistant placed the photos on William's desk.

###chapter 174  What Is Your Motive?

William picked up the photo and instantly recognized the sneaky figure as Missy.

At the funeral reception, Missy had been causing a scene, constantly trying to trash Christina's reputation.

Now, seeing Missy tailing her, it was clear she was up to no good.

"Got it. Go ahead and take care of the clients," William said, his face darkening.

Last time, he hadn't protected Christina well enough. He wouldn't let that happen again.

Meanwhile, Christina had been swamped ever since her last chat with Mia, running around to check out Mia's house in person.

She was so busy she often skipped meals.

Mia even called her, "Christina, you know I have plenty of houses and I'm not in a rush to move in. Just come over whenever you can. No need to hurry."

"I've already delayed you for so long. I'm almost done now. If I drag it out any longer, it would be too much," Christina replied, feeling embarrassed.

"What's the big deal? We're good friends. No need to be so formal. I still have a few sets of keys to give you. I'll have Alex bring them over when he gets back," Mia said, her phone on speaker.

Alex, who was nearby, nodded eagerly. He was willing to deliver anything, not just the keys.

"Alright, whatever works for you," Christina said, hanging up the phone as she prepared to cross the street.

It was a red light, and she stood at the edge of the sidewalk, unaware that a figure was slowly approaching her.

Missy had been following her for days, unsure of how to deal with her.

Drugging Christina again wouldn't work; she was already on guard. Missy didn't have the skills to come up with another plan.

As she watched the cars speed by, a plan suddenly formed in her mind.

She silently walked up to Christina, her malicious intent growing.

In the next moment, she reached out and shoved Christina hard.

Missy felt a rush of satisfaction, thinking she had finally gotten rid of Christina and could escape her miserable life with the money Jennifer promised her.

Christina stumbled, but just as she thought she would fall, a strong arm caught her and pulled her into an embrace.

It was William.

Two police officers stood behind him.

"You're under arrest for attempted murder. Come with us," one officer said.

"No, I didn't! You can't accuse me of that!" Missy was terrified.

She kept backing away, trying to deflect the blame. "I just accidentally bumped into her. There are so many people at the crosswalk. Accidental contact is inevitable. How can you accuse me?"

The police didn't waste time arguing. They handcuffed her and took her away.

William still held Christina tightly.

His heart was racing. When he saw Missy approaching, he had a bad feeling and rushed over.

Luckily, he arrived just in time.

"Let go of me," Christina said, pushing him away as soon as she steadied herself.

She felt that William's timely appearances were too coincidental.

She voiced her suspicion directly, "Have you been following me?"

"Of course not," William denied immediately. "Don't always think the worst of me."

"Once might be a coincidence, but twice, three times? Even a kid wouldn't buy that, let alone me," Christina said, not buying it.

"Maybe it just means we're meant to be," William suggested.

"Give me a break," Christina interrupted. "Even if we are, it's a cursed fate. Where were you when I needed you the most?"

He now claimed to care about their child, but back then, he had completely ignored Harper.

His current kindness couldn't make up for the past.

"Even if you don't admit it, I know you've been following me or having someone track me. Stop wasting your time. You know I hate you," Christina said, turning to leave.

William watched her walk away, feeling a deep sadness.

How had things gotten to this point between them?

He desperately wanted to change everything and make amends, but he didn't know how to get Christina to accept him.

Meanwhile, at the police station, Missy was panicking, especially since she couldn't use her phone in the interrogation room.

Facing the stern police officers, she broke down. "I really didn't push her. It was just an accident. You can't arrest me for something so minor."

"You attempted murder. We saw it clearly," the officer said, not swayed by her words.

They had witnessed the scene firsthand.

"Besides, this is the information age. There are cameras everywhere, especially near traffic lights. Everything you did was recorded. You'd better explain your motive," the officer continued.

"I didn't do it. Please, let me go," Missy pleaded, tears streaming down her face.

Her attempts to gain sympathy failed, leaving her no choice but to hope Jennifer would help.

When she finally got her phone, she sent Jennifer a desperate message: "Please help me. I won't go abroad. Just get me out of here, and I'll do anything for you."

On the other end, Jennifer's face was cold.

She held her phone in one hand, clenching the other in anger.

Missy was such an idiot. How could she mess up so badly?

Missy had failed before, and now she had gotten herself arrested. If Jennifer helped her, it would leave evidence against her.

But Jennifer also feared Missy might drag her down with her.

Suddenly, she thought of Missy's grandfather. He was old and believed Jennifer was Missy's friend, making him an easy target.

Jennifer tricked him into going to a nursing home and took his photo, sending it anonymously to Missy.

###chapter 175  William, I Know You Are a Good Person

The moment Missy saw the photo, it felt like she had plunged into an ice-cold abyss, her heart freezing over.

Jennifer didn't say a word, but Missy knew exactly what she wanted.

Jennifer wanted Missy to take the fall for everything.

Otherwise, Jennifer would go after Missy's grandfather. He was her biological grandfather, already eighty years old. If he got hurt because of her, how could she live with herself?

She couldn't be that unfilial.

Missy had no choice but to comply.

What she didn't expect was Jennifer's ruthlessness, cutting ties with her completely.

And with William's thorough investigation, all her past misdeeds quickly came to light.

"Why did you drug Christina?" William asked, holding the evidence, his anger palpable.

He also doubted that Missy could have done all this alone.

"Who are your accomplices?"

Missy wanted so badly to expose Jennifer.

All of this was Jennifer's idea; she was forced into it. But she couldn't.

For her grandfather's sake, Missy had to swallow her grievances. "No accomplices. I just couldn't stand Christina. She made my life miserable!"

"You'll spend the rest of your life in prison," William said, calling the company's legal team.

The Cavendish family had the best lawyers, and even William's friends were top-notch attorneys.

Missy couldn't afford a lawyer and had to apply for legal aid. Given the circumstances, she was sentenced to prison.

William even had Bob pull some strings to ensure Missy got what she deserved.

After handling everything, William rushed back to Christina.

Before he could say anything, Christina received a call from Elisa.

Elisa's voice was hoarse, "Christina, can you come to the hospital?"

Christina's expression turned tense. "Mom, is something wrong?"

She tensed up like a startled bird, her body rigid, brows furrowed.

"Christina, I just really want to see you," Elisa's voice choked up.

Since her illness, Elisa's emotions had been unstable, often sinking into deep lows, and during those times, she especially wanted to see her daughter.

"Mom, take care of yourself. I'm coming right now."

Christina couldn't wait a moment longer. She threw on a coat and changed into comfortable shoes.

William quickly moved to support her back, his concern almost tangible. "It's so late, and you still want to go out?"

He spoke cautiously, his eyes never leaving her, worried something might harm her.

"To the hospital. Mom wants to see me."

For some reason, saying this made her eyes well up.

Christina fought back the urge to cry, speaking calmly, "I'll be back soon. You should rest."

"No way."

William refused without hesitation.

"You're pregnant. It's not safe for you to go alone."

William's tone was serious, as if facing the most important matter in the world.

Christina paused while grabbing her keys.

If she remembered correctly, she had just found out she was pregnant.

She looked down at her still-flat stomach. If she wore loose clothes, no one would even know.

"William! My belly isn't even big yet. Stop exaggerating."

Christina playfully punched William's chest, but he caught her hand before it landed.

Feeling his warm hand, she quickly pulled back.

William raised an eyebrow, his deep voice resonating, "I'll go with you."

His tone left no room for doubt.

"Suit yourself."

With that, Christina stormed out.

William followed closely, his eyes on her, even watching for any obstacles on the ground.

"Wait here. Don't move or talk to strangers."

William nagged.

Christina frowned impatiently, "If you don't get the car, I'll call a cab."

Hearing this, William had no choice but to get the car.

He parked by the curb and opened the passenger door for her.

Christina remained silent.

She wasn't used to this overly cautious William, feeling like he was hiding something.

On the way, William drove slowly, mindful of the pregnant Christina, even getting honked at by other cars.

Christina had to remind him, "I'm just newly pregnant. No need to be so careful. Let's get to the hospital."

Her heart would only settle once she saw her mom.

Since Christina said so, William sped up a bit but kept an eye on her for any discomfort.

At the hospital.

Christina carried a bouquet of lilies, William beside her with milk in one hand and fruit in the other.

They entered the hospital room together.

Elisa had an IV in her arm, looking much thinner, her hospital gown hanging loosely.

Christina held back tears, placing the flowers on the bedside table. "Mom, the disinfectant smell is too strong here. These flowers will make you feel better."

"You're such a good child."

Elisa's lips were dry and cracked, but she forced a smile. "I'm happy just to see you."

Even saying this, she was out of breath.

Christina gripped her hand tightly. "Mom, the best doctors are here. You just need to hold on. There's hope."

She was reassuring both Elisa and herself.

Elisa's eyes had lost their sparkle, now dull and hazy, as if covered by a mist. She gently placed her other hand on Christina's, "Christina, I won't give up. For you, I'll hold on till the last moment."

She could feel her body deteriorating but didn't want to worry Christina, so she pushed through.

"William, come here."

Elisa gestured for William to sit next to Christina.

William complied.

Elisa took William's hand and placed it on Christina's. "William, I know you're a good man. If the day comes when I pass, you must take care of Christina. She's always been strong, keeping her pain inside. I'm really afraid..."

###chapter 176 I Am a Bit Worried About Christina

Before she could finish her sentence, Elisa started coughing violently.

Christina gently patted her back, trying to soothe her, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.

It took a while before Elisa could breathe easily again. She exhaled heavily, "Christina, the hardest part for me is leaving you. I haven't even seen your baby yet, haven't held them in my arms."

A tear slipped from the corner of Elisa's eye as she spoke.

"Mom, don't talk like that. You're gonna get better. My baby needs their grandma, and you better be around when that time comes," Christina tried to sound cheerful, but the sadness and pain in her voice were unmistakable.

Elisa's face was pale, but a rare blush appeared as she smiled, "Christina, if you ever find yourself alone, don't try to handle everything by yourself. Take good care of yourself."

As they were chatting, Raymond walked in with a thermos, "Hey, you're here."

He sat on the other side of the bed, opening the thermos with practiced ease. Inside was some sweet millet porridge. "Have a little something to eat."

Christina noticed the gray hairs at Raymond's temples and how his posture had lost its former strength, replaced by a weariness.

"Thanks, Raymond."

Elisa naturally took the porridge he handed her, but her arms were too weak now.

Raymond seemed to notice her struggle and began feeding her spoonful by spoonful, "Is it sweet? I added a few extra spoons of sugar this time."

"Sweet," Elisa replied honestly.

It wasn't just the porridge that was sweet; her heart felt sweet too.

The peaceful atmosphere was abruptly shattered by an uninvited guest. Grace Cavendish, in high heels, burst into the room, "Dad, why are you here again? Didn't I tell you to hire a nurse to take care of her?"

It was Raymond's daughter, Grace, who had been living abroad for years and had only recently returned.

Christina sensed Elisa's tension and spoke coldly, "You're not welcome here. Please leave."

"And who do you think you are?" Grace retorted, her eyes sweeping over Christina with disdain. "You and your mother are just the same, only good for-"

Before she could finish her insult, Raymond cut her off, "Enough! This is not the place for your nonsense."

William stepped protectively in front of Christina, "Grace, apologize!"

Grace refused, "Uncle, you've lost your mind, letting a woman like Christina deceive you!"

Raymond, fearing the situation would escalate, quickly pulled Grace aside.

Christina, not wanting the conflict to disturb Elisa's rest, said, "I want to go home. Mom, I'll come see you another day."

"Okay."

"Let's go home," William immediately put his arm around Christina's shoulders.

Whatever Christina wanted, William was ready to do it.

Soon, William brought Christina back home.

The warm yellow light in the house couldn't chase away the chill surrounding Christina.

She walked straight to the couch, sat down, and closed her eyes, exhaustion written all over her face.

William quietly approached her, crouching down, and asked gently, "Christina, are you hungry? I can make you something to eat."

Christina slowly opened her eyes, her gaze cold and distant. "No, I'm just tired. I need to rest."

William looked at her with deep concern but didn't press further. He nodded silently. "Let me help you to your room."

Christina avoided his outstretched hand, standing up on her own and heading to the bedroom.

William watched her retreating figure, his heart aching.

He paced the living room for a long time before quietly returning to his study to handle some work, though his thoughts remained with Christina.

Sometime later, the quiet night was broken by the sound of retching.

William jumped up from his chair and rushed to the bedroom.

He opened the door to find the room dark, but in the faint moonlight, he saw Christina bent over the bed, her body shaking from severe morning sickness.

William's heart clenched. He quickly turned on the light and hurried to her side, gently rubbing her back.

"Christina, are you okay? Is it really bad?"

Christina weakly waved him away, but the turmoil in her stomach left her too weak to speak, only able to continue dry heaving.

Ignoring her attempts to push him away, William went to the bathroom, fetched a warm towel, and gently wiped her face. He then brought a glass of warm water, carefully holding it to her lips. "Christina, rinse your mouth."

Christina turned her head, unwilling to accept his help, but her discomfort left her with no strength to resist.

William waited patiently, his eyes filled with worry.

Once Christina seemed a bit better, William helped her lie back down and tucked her in.

After making sure she was comfortable, William whispered, "Christina, get some rest. I'll be in the living room if you need anything."

Christina didn't respond. William took one last look at her before quietly closing the bedroom door.

Just as he reached the living room, the doorbell rang, breaking the silence.

William tensed up, glancing towards the bedroom, worried the noise might wake Christina. He quickly but quietly went to open the door.

It was his friend, Terry Perez. William immediately put a finger to his lips, signaling for silence, and gently pulled Terry into the living room.

Terry looked puzzled but didn't speak. William quickly explained in a low voice, "Christina is resting. Don't wake her. She's had a rough day and just fell asleep."

Terry nodded in understanding.

William gestured for Terry to sit on the soft couch and then hurried to the kitchen.

He soon returned with a steaming cup of coffee, placing it gently on the table in front of Terry. "You came over so late. Is there an update on the project? Thanks for coming all this way."

Terry took a sip of the coffee, frowning slightly as he gathered his thoughts. After setting the cup down, he said, "Yeah, there are some new terms from the partners that we need to discuss. The project's on a tight schedule, so I thought it best to come over directly."

William nodded, but his eyes kept drifting towards the bedroom.

He refocused on Terry. "Alright, let's go over it quickly. I'm still worried about Christina."

###chapter 177 This Is Not Good for the Child

Terry noticed William's distraction and smirked. "Thinking about your wife, huh? Don't worry, I'll keep it quick."

William smiled, not denying it.

Terry started talking about the collaboration, going over the terms the partners proposed and potential issues. William listened, chiming in with his thoughts and suggestions now and then, but his mind kept drifting back to Christina in the bedroom.

After a while, William couldn't shake the image of Christina's pale face. He interrupted Terry, "Hang on a sec," and quickly walked to the kitchen.

He expertly opened the fridge, grabbed a few of Christina's favorite fruits, and swiftly cut them into small pieces, arranging them on a delicate plate.

Then, he grabbed a soft, thin blanket from the cabinet and hurried into the bedroom with everything in his arms.

Christina was still awake, lying quietly on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling.

Hearing the door, she turned her head and saw William enter, frowning slightly.

William approached the bed with a gentle smile, placed the fruit on the bedside table, and softly draped the blanket over Christina. "Maybe some fruit will help you feel better. These are your favorites. I'll be outside talking to Terry. If you need anything, just call me, and I'll come right away."

Christina turned her head away without speaking, her gaze returning to the ceiling.

The scent of the fruit in the silent room felt like a sharp mockery, making her feel even more stifled.

She recalled the past when her daughter was gravely ill, her face flushed with fever. She had desperately called William, her voice choked with tears, begging him to come see their daughter. But all she got was his cold response, saying he was with someone important and not to disturb him.

The despair and helplessness from that time now washed over her like a tidal wave.

And now, this William, who once ignored her and their daughter, was suddenly so considerate. How could she easily let go?

The more Christina thought about it, the more she realized she couldn't sink into this false warmth. Her eyes grew resolute as she picked up her phone and quickly scrolled through her contacts.

Finally, her finger stopped on a lawyer's number, and she dialed.

"Hello, Mr. Oscar, this is Christina."

"I need your help with a divorce case, as soon as possible," Christina's voice was low but firm.

Oscar paused briefly. "Alright, Ms. Windsor. Please come to the office when you can, and we'll discuss the details and process."

"Okay." Christina hung up without hesitation.

She placed the phone aside and quietly stared out at the dark night sky.

Outside.

Terry looked at the distracted William and sighed. "You're not really here. What's going on with your wife? Is it serious?"

William sighed, his face full of worry. "Her morning sickness is really bad. Seeing her suffer, I can't focus."

Terry nodded understandingly. "I get it. Pregnancy needs care. But this project is important too. The client's new terms need attention."

William rubbed his temples. "I know the project's important, but with Christina like this, I can't fully commit. What's the toughest part of the new terms?"

Terry took a sip of coffee. "Profit share and delivery time. The client wants 40%, which is way higher than we expected, and they want delivery moved up to the 15th of next month. We need to compress the schedule and increase investment."

William frowned in thought. "40% is too high, it really cuts into our profit. Moving up delivery is also a big challenge, but this project is crucial for the company's growth. We can't give up."

Terry nodded. "I think so too. Let's try negotiating down to 35%. For delivery, we can optimize processes and add manpower to meet the deadline."

William considered it. "35% is the bottom line. Draft a revised delivery plan with resource allocation, and we'll review it. Keep the communication friendly."

Terry smiled. "Got it. Take care of your wife. I've got this covered. We'll stay in touch."

William was grateful. "Thanks, man. I appreciate it."

Terry waved it off. "No problem. Go check on her. I'm heading out."

William walked Terry to the door. "Drive safe. Keep me updated."

Terry put on his coat and turned. "Don't overwork yourself. Take care of her and the baby."

William nodded, watching Terry leave.

He hurried back to the bedroom, still thinking about checking on Christina.

As he reached the door, he heard Christina on the phone, the word "divorce" ringing in his ears like a thunderclap.

He froze, his heart clenching painfully, his face turning pale.

After a long moment, he slowly raised his hand and gently pushed the door open.

The creak of the door hinge sounded especially loud in the quiet room.

He saw Christina sitting quietly on the bed, her phone beside her.

His voice trembled with disbelief. "Christina, are you really going to divorce me?"

Christina looked up, her eyes cold and unwavering. "Yes. I can't forget the past, and neither can you, right? Otherwise, why would you try to make amends? Those wounds are like scars on my heart, each one deep and painful."

William was taken aback, standing up slowly, his voice hoarse. "Christina, I'll agree to the divorce. But you need to have the baby. I want this child to be our Harper. It might be the only happiness I can hold onto that's connected to you."

Christina laughed coldly, her eyes full of scorn. "Hypocrite. Even now, you speak so righteously. Do you think saying that will erase what you've done? Are you really doing this for the child, or just to satisfy your own desires?"

William opened his mouth to argue but seeing the scorn and anger in Christina's eyes, he swallowed his words.

He knew that nothing he said now would make Christina believe him.

He sighed softly, his voice even gentler. "Christina, I know my words mean nothing now. I understand your resentment. I'm just worried about your health. You're pregnant, and this stress isn't good for the baby."

###chapter 178  It's All Because of You, Bitch!

Christina turned her head away, scoffing, "I don't need your fake concern. I know my own body."

William didn't say anything more, just quietly watched Christina.

After a while, he slowly walked to the bedside, bent down, and pulled the thin blanket up to gently cover Christina's shoulders.

"Get some rest and don't overthink things. No matter what, I hope you and the baby stay safe," William said softly.

With that, he straightened up, gave Christina a long look, then turned and walked heavily towards the door.

The next morning, sunlight streamed gently through the gaps in the curtains, softly illuminating the room.

Christina slowly opened her eyes, the thoughts from the previous night still weighing heavily on her mind, making her feel particularly burdened.

She got up, washed up quickly, and dragged her slightly heavy steps to the living room.

The housekeeper, Debra, happened to come out of the kitchen, wearing a warm smile. "Good morning, Mrs. Cavendish. Mr. Cavendish left early for work but made sure to tell me to make your favorite shrimp porridge. It's ready on the table for you."

Christina nodded slightly and responded softly, "Thank you, Debra."

Just then, the doorbell rang.

Debra turned to open the door, but before she could react, Jennifer barged in, shoving Debra so hard that she stumbled back, hitting her head on the corner of a cabinet with a painful thud, and collapsed unconscious.

Jennifer didn't even glance at Debra, her eyes fixed angrily on Christina. "Christina, today is your last day alive!"

Christina, both shocked and furious, immediately became alert, stepping back a few paces. "Jennifer, are you crazy? What do you think you're doing?"

Jennifer brandished a knife, her eyes filled with hatred. "You took William from me and now you want to have his child? I won't let you! Today, you die!"

With that, Jennifer lunged at Christina with the knife.

Christina's eyes widened in terror as she dodged to the side, bumping into a table in her panic.

Her heart raced with fear, torn between concern for the unconscious Debra and the need to defend herself against the crazed Jennifer.

Jennifer advanced relentlessly, and Christina grabbed a decorative item from the table, hurling it at Jennifer.

Jennifer couldn't dodge in time, and the item struck her arm. She cried out in pain but didn't drop the knife.

"You bitch, you dare fight back!" Jennifer screamed, charging again.

Christina retreated desperately until her back hit the wall, leaving her with nowhere to go.

Seeing Jennifer's madness, Christina steeled herself. As Jennifer got close, she kicked out hard, sending Jennifer sprawling to the floor.

Jennifer quickly got up, her eyes even more ferocious, like a wild beast.

"I will kill you today!" Jennifer screamed, rushing at Christina again with the knife.

Christina instinctively raised her hands to block, and in the struggle, the knife cut Jennifer's arm, causing blood to gush out.

Jennifer screamed, dropping the knife with a clatter.

Christina stood stunned for a moment before grabbing her phone from the table and calling 911.

Looking at the barely conscious Jennifer, Christina slowly closed her eyes.

Jennifer had humiliated her many times before, and now she had tried to kill her. This was Jennifer's just deserts.

At that moment, the front door burst open, and in walked William.

A trace of disdain crossed Christina's face. She could never forget what William had done in the past.

William stood frozen in shock at the bloody scene before him.

"You..."

Christina sneered, glancing at William. "What? Are you feeling sorry for her?"

Her hands trembled under her sleeves, but her voice was firm.

William quickly moved to check on Jennifer, who clung to his sleeve, sobbing.

"I just came to check on her, and she suddenly attacked me," Jennifer cried pitifully, convincing anyone who didn't know better.

William looked at Christina with questioning eyes, but she remained silent.

Christina eventually followed the ambulance to the hospital.

As soon as they arrived, Jennifer's parents rushed at Christina, ready to attack.

"You bitch, how dare you hurt my daughter! I'll make you pay!" Sophia shouted, raising her hand to strike Christina.

Christina grabbed Sophia's arm. "Your daughter came to my house and attacked me. I was just defending myself. How can you blame me without knowing the facts?"

"Stop lying! It must be something you did!" Sophia yelled, trying to lunge at Christina again, looking like she wanted to kill her.

William stepped in front of Christina. "Until we know what happened, please don't act rashly, or I'll call the police."

Sophia, though furious, stepped back, glaring venomously at Christina.

Jennifer's parents knew William's status and didn't dare to act out in front of him.

"This isn't over," Sophia spat.

Christina felt a pang of injustice. Jennifer had started the trouble, so why was she being blamed?

When the doctor came out of surgery and said Jennifer was fine, Arnold and Sophia finally relaxed.

"Since she's okay, you should go home. I'll handle things here," William said.

Christina was surprised by William's tone. In the past, he would never have spoken to her like this. He seemed like a different person now.

But she didn't need this new William anymore.

She turned and left.

Back home, she couldn't sleep. She didn't know when she finally dozed off, but she was woken by William's call.

Christina didn't answer.

A few minutes later, the phone rang again.

###chapter 179  It's My Duty to Help You

Christina barely furrowed her brow before finally answering the call, asking what he wanted.

"What do you need?"

When she heard William's next words, Christina felt a surge of anger.

Jennifer's mother had taken Christina to court over the incident where Christina had hurt Jennifer.

Christina should have seen this coming. Jennifer was ruthless, and her family was no better.

When Christina didn't respond for a while, William quickly tried to reassure her.

"Don't worry, I have a friend who's a lawyer. I've asked him to handle this, and I promise you won't be wronged."

Hearing this, tears slowly rolled down Christina's cheeks.

If William had done this in the past, they wouldn't be in this situation now.

Since William was helping her so much, she felt she had to show some gratitude. Christina thanked William before hanging up.

Hearing her thanks, a small smile appeared on William's face.

"Don't you have any security cameras at home? Without them, this could be hard to prove."

A friend's voice came through William's ear.

William frowned, unsure of what to do.

"Whatever it takes, I need you to help me with this."

The friend looked at William in surprise.

William had never been one to beg for help, and his recent behavior was puzzling. But it was a change for the better.

"It's getting late. I should head back."

William checked his watch and quickly left.

He had done many things to wrong Christina in the past, but things were different now. He wouldn't make the same mistakes again.

When William returned home, he found the house dark, with Christina lying in the bedroom, looking somber.

Hearing footsteps, Christina looked up and was surprised to see William. She immediately stood up.

"Why are you back?"

William felt a pang of sadness at her words but managed a small smile.

"I know this situation is hard for anyone to handle. I came back early to be with you."

Christina scoffed and remained silent, ignoring William.

William tried to approach her, but seeing her rejection, he turned and left the room.

He owed Christina too much. Whatever she did to him, he deserved it.

Meanwhile, Jennifer's parents were plotting against Christina.

"That Christina is such a wretch. If it weren't for her, our daughter wouldn't be in this state. I want to make her pay!" Sophia fumed, while Arnold tried to calm her down.

"Have you noticed William's attitude has changed recently?"

Sophia recalled how William had defended Christina and looked puzzled.

"Now that you mention it, yeah. I wonder what that wretch Christina said to him to change his mind."

After a long silence, Arnold decided to dig into Christina and William's situation, which eased Sophia's mind a bit.

In the following days, William stayed by Christina's side.

Even though Christina treated him like a stranger, William didn't leave, which puzzled her.

Christina wanted to ask William what he was doing, but when she met his gaze, she couldn't say a word.

Arnold's investigation confirmed that William had been with Christina, making Arnold and Sophia feel threatened.

"Christina must have some skills to keep William from visiting our daughter," Sophia said, her face twisted with anger.

After some discussion, Arnold and Sophia went to the hospital to inform Jennifer, who was furious.

"Are you saying that wretch Christina has been with William these past few days?"

Seeing Arnold and Sophia nod, Jennifer angrily threw a cup to the ground.

"Christina, you really have some nerve!"

Jennifer's anger caused her wound to hurt, and she gasped in pain.

Arnold and Sophia quickly tried to calm her down.

"You're still injured. Don't get upset."

Arnold continued, "You see now that William doesn't care about you. Why keep chasing him?"

Jennifer gripped the bed sheets tightly, almost tearing them apart.

"I don't care. Even if I can't be with William, Christina won't either!"

Seeing Jennifer's crazed state, Arnold and Sophia felt a bit scared. Their daughter had changed so much.

But since Jennifer insisted, Arnold and Sophia were willing to support her.

Meanwhile, William received a call about Christina's lawsuit. Arnold and Sophia were relentless, determined to make Christina pay.

William had been dealing with Christina's case for days, leaving him exhausted.

He rubbed his temples, looking worn out, unsure if his friend could win the case.

Christina came downstairs and saw William's state. She approached and placed a glass of water in front of him.

Christina knew what William had been doing for her.

"If you can't handle it, don't worry about me. I'll find another lawyer."

Her tone was cold as she spoke.

She didn't want to owe William anything, knowing she had nothing to repay him with.

Hearing her words, William quickly looked up and shook his head.

"You don't need to be so formal with me. Helping you is the right thing to do. I've already arranged for someone to handle it, so don't worry too much."

###chapter 180  Who Are You?

"If I remember right, there was a security camera in the house. I wonder if it caught what happened that day."

Christina frowned as she spoke, and William's eyes lit up instantly.

"Are you serious? Can you show me the footage?"

But the higher their hopes, the greater their disappointment.

Christina led William to the camera, and they found it was positioned perfectly to capture everything that happened that day.

William had someone take down the camera, but when they checked it, they discovered it had been destroyed.

William's eyes widened in disbelief, and he clenched his fists tightly.

He hadn't expected Jennifer to be so thorough, cutting off this potential evidence.

William felt a wave of dejection.

Christina also felt a pang of discomfort in her heart.

It seemed Jennifer would stop at nothing to get at her, even going so far as to destroy the camera. Who knew what terrifying things she might do next?

If she could help it, Christina would rather never see Jennifer again.

Just then, William's phone rang again. When he heard the news on the other end, his face turned extremely grim.

After he hung up, Christina immediately asked, "What's wrong? You don't look so good."

As she asked, Christina felt a surge of anxiety. If she guessed correctly, it had to be something related to Jennifer.

"Nothing," William said after a long silence, as if he didn't want Christina to know.

But the more he acted this way, the more curious Christina became about how bad things had gotten.

"I think I have the right to know the truth. Just tell me."

Seeing Christina's determined look, William finally spoke slowly, "Arnold and Sophia are going all out against you. They've started spreading rumors about you online."

As he spoke, William opened a forum on his phone and showed it to Christina.

Christina saw a video in one of the posts, and the content was shocking-it was Arnold and Sophia.

They looked tearful, accusing Christina of hurting Jennifer, painting her as ruthless and vicious with every word.

The online community, unaware of the truth, quickly turned against Christina after seeing the video, flooding the comments with insults.

Christina gritted her teeth, unable to believe Arnold and Sophia could do such a thing.

They were supposed to be elders, yet they blamed everything on Christina for Jennifer's sake. It was truly too much.

Seeing Christina's distress, William quickly took the phone away, not wanting her to see more.

"I know they're trying to ruin your reputation. I'll arrange for someone to handle this as soon as possible. Don't worry, try to stay calm."

Christina clenched her fists and sighed.

Even after being reborn, she was still stuck in this miserable situation, unable to clear her name despite the injustice.

She had seen all the hateful comments directed at her and finally just turned and went back to her bedroom, checking the post's progress on her phone.

The post seemed to have been boosted, with comments and likes increasing rapidly.

William called the forum's administrators, hoping they could suppress the post.

But soon, the administrators informed William that the post had been heavily promoted and couldn't be taken down.

Arnold and Sophia's post had been widely shared and was spiraling out of control.

Seeing the growing online abuse, Christina had no choice but to turn off her phone, trying to ignore the vile words.

William checked on Christina later and was relieved to find she wasn't too troubled by it.

The next morning, William came to Christina's room.

"I have to leave to handle some things. Call me if you need anything."

Christina nodded lightly, not saying much.

But that afternoon, she heard a knock on the door and frowned in confusion.

It shouldn't be William at this time. Who could it be?

As she walked to the door and opened it, a rotten cabbage leaf hit her face, making her stagger back.

"It's all your fault! If it weren't for you, Jennifer wouldn't be like this!"

To avoid falling, Christina leaned against the cabinet behind her.

But soon, more rotten vegetables and eggs were thrown at her, causing her pain all over.

Christina looked at the group in front of her in shock.

They seemed ready to storm in, and Christina rushed to close the door, but they were too many, and she couldn't hold them off.

They quickly forced the door open and barged in.

"Who are you? Do you know it's illegal to trespass?"

Christina frowned tightly, looking at the group.

From what they had said, Christina had a good guess about their identity.

They were here for Jennifer.

Christina felt a surge of fear.

She was alone in the house. If they attacked her, it would be bad.

One of them pointed a finger almost touching Christina's face.

"You're a vile person, hurting Jennifer repeatedly. How can you be so malicious?"

"I think you have it wrong. Jennifer came to my house and attacked me first. I hurt her in self-defense."

Hearing Christina's words, the group exchanged glances, seemingly doubting her story.

But soon, one of them looked furious, not believing a word Christina said.

"You're just afraid to admit your evil deeds! Jennifer is clearly a kind person. How could she do what you said?"

As he spoke, he threw a hard object at Christina's forehead, making her gasp in pain.

###chapter 181  I'll Take You Away Immediately

Christina couldn't care less about her injuries at the moment.

"Y'all better get outta here right now, or I'm calling the cops," she warned.

As she moved towards the table to grab her phone, the group rushed at her, grabbing her before she could make the call.

The person who had hit her earlier snatched the phone from her hand and smashed it to the ground with force.

The phone shattered into pieces, and Christina gasped in shock. She hurried over to check it, only to find it completely unusable.

Seeing this, Christina felt a surge of anger.

"Isn't this going too far?" a girl with a slightly timid voice spoke up.

The others fell silent, except for the one who had smashed the phone, who let out a cold snort.

"Don't be fooled by her. If she could hurt Jennifer, she's definitely not innocent. We need to teach her a lesson, or she'll keep causing trouble."

Christina couldn't hold back her temper any longer. She turned and pointed towards the door, shouting, "This isn't a place for you to mess around. Get out now, or else!"

With that, she grabbed a fruit knife from the table and pointed it at the group.

Seeing this, some of the more timid ones felt a pang of fear and quickly left.

The one who had smashed the phone signaled to a burly guy, who then rushed over and knocked the knife out of Christina's hand.

The burly guy shoved Christina hard, causing her to fall to the ground.

"You think you can fight us? Today, we're going to make sure you remember this."

As he said this, the burly guy moved forward and pinned Christina down. She struggled, but his strength was overwhelming.

The person who had smashed her phone picked up the fruit knife and slowly approached Christina. Her eyes widened in terror, unable to believe what was happening.

"Don't you dare!"

Just as the knife was about to touch Christina's face, a hand grabbed the attacker's wrist tightly.

"What the hell are you doing? Who let you in here?" a voice demanded.

Christina opened her eyes to see William standing there.

A wave of mixed emotions washed over her.

William kicked the burly guy away and helped Christina up, his eyes dark and menacing as he glared at the attacker.

"If you don't want to die, leave now. Otherwise, I can't guarantee where this knife will end up."

Seeing the look in William's eyes, the attacker trembled.

At that moment, the attacker suddenly smirked.

Christina turned just in time to see the burly guy grabbing a vase and swinging it at her. William stepped in to shield her, taking the blow himself.

Blood trickled down William's forehead.

Christina's eyes widened in shock.

Seeing the blood, the two attackers panicked and fled.

Christina, unable to control herself, instinctively moved closer to William.

"You..."

Before William could finish his sentence, he coughed up a mouthful of blood.

The ground was stained red, and Christina's hands and clothes were covered in blood.

"Don't talk! The ambulance is on its way!" Christina pressed her hands against William's chest, trying to suppress her emotions.

In their past life, William had treated her like dirt.

But in this life, he had protected her, even taking a fatal blow for her.

Christina felt conflicted, unsure how to respond to William.

Forget it.

If William survived, he wouldn't owe her anything anymore.

"No."

Even as his vision blurred, William held onto Christina's hand tightly.

"I don't ask for your forgiveness. Just promise me you'll live well and have the baby."

"Shut up!"

Jennifer's eyes were bloodshot as she shoved Christina aside, laughing maniacally.

"Christina, I want you to suffer forever. If I can't have him, neither can you!"

Her expression was crazed, and she waved a knife around, scaring Christina into staying back.

"Jennifer, don't do anything rash!"

Christina's eyes were fixed on William, trying to reason with Jennifer.

"William is hurt. Let's get him to the hospital first. We can talk later..."

"Talk about what?"

Jennifer sneered, pressing the knife against William's neck, her body trembling with excitement.

"William, I love you so much. Why can't you see that? Why do you love this woman who treats you like dirt?"

"Today, you're coming with me. We'll be together forever, okay?"

Her expression was deranged as she dragged William into a car, which sped off, leaving Christina in a cloud of exhaust.

"William! William!"

Christina stumbled and fell, chasing after the car until she collapsed from exhaustion, watching helplessly as it disappeared.

Her arms and legs were scraped, but she didn't notice, her eyes fixed on where the car had vanished.

After a while, she seemed to snap out of it, feeling an emptiness inside, like something was missing.

She had been ready to let go, but why did he risk everything to save her?

Christina stood up, but the effort made her dizzy, and she collapsed again.

"Christina!"

Walter's voice called out from behind her.

He had tracked her location and rushed over, seeing her collapse.

"Christina, are you okay?"

Walter's heart raced as he hurried to her side, catching her in his arms.

"Christina, hold on. I'll get you out of here!"

###chapter 182 Misunderstood

Walter finally breathed a sigh of relief when he confirmed that Christina had only fainted from exhaustion.

As he looked at Christina sleeping peacefully in his arms, his eyes turned cold. Without a backward glance, he started walking forward.

Five days later, on a small island.

Christina sat in a corner of the villa, staring out the window at the waves crashing against the shore.

At the doorway, Walter watched as the wind gently lifted her hair, a silent, bitter smile playing on his lips.

"What's on your mind?" he asked casually, walking over and handing her a glass of water. "Here, drink this."

Since Christina had woken up, she had stayed within the confines of the villa.

She ate quietly, drank quietly, and then sat by the window as if waiting for someone, silent and still like a doll.

Even when changing her bandages, the pain from her wounds never made her flinch.

She never asked about William, as if he had never existed.

Thinking about this, Walter felt a pang in his heart.

With William's fate still unknown, he didn't know how to face Christina.

Fortunately, Christina's injuries were minor. With the care of a private doctor and her compliance with every instruction, she was almost fully recovered.

"Not much," Christina replied with a faint smile, taking the glass from him. "Thanks."

She drank the water in one gulp, but the next moment, she heard Walter's slightly apologetic voice.

"I'm sorry, Christina. We still haven't found William. He might already be..."

"It's okay," Christina interrupted him calmly after a moment of daze, shaking her head lightly. There was no trace of emotion in her eyes as she sighed softly.

"He's your uncle. It's your duty to do everything you can to find him. As for me..."

She subconsciously touched her abdomen, where a small life was growing.

Realizing this, her expression turned a bit wistful.

After everything that happened in her past life, she wasn't sure if she should keep this child.

"Focus on your recovery. You and the baby are the most important now. As for William's funeral..."

Walter's voice choked up slightly. "I'll take care of it. Don't be too sad."

Walter had been losing sleep over William's situation, and it showed in his haggard appearance.

Christina opened her mouth but didn't say anything more, offering only a few weak words of comfort.

To her, William felt like a distant memory from another lifetime.

He had taken a fatal blow for her, and from that moment on, they owed each other nothing.

William no longer owed her anything.

And likewise, there was no longer any connection between them.

It was Walter who had been a great help to her these past few days.

"Walter, I've caused you so much trouble lately. I can manage on my own," Christina said apologetically, forcing a smile.

Walter, who had no real obligation to her, had done so much for her.

Christina felt a bit guilty about it.

Since she couldn't reciprocate, she decided not to involve him any further.

"It's no trouble at all. You don't need to be so formal with me," Walter said, shaking his head and frowning slightly. "Christina, regardless of our relationship, I consider you a friend. You don't need to be so polite."

Christina hesitated. "But I..."

After everything that happened in her past life, she couldn't trust any man again.

She couldn't develop any feelings for Walter beyond friendship.

"It's okay, you don't need to say anything," Walter interrupted her quickly, forcing a light-hearted smile to hide his own feelings.

"The most important thing now is for you to take care of yourself. You're pregnant, so you need to be extra careful."

Christina nodded reluctantly. "Alright, I'll listen to you."

"That's the spirit," Walter said with a smile. He was about to say something to cheer her up when the private doctor appeared at the door. "Mr. Cavendish, it's time for Ms. Windsor's prenatal checkup."

Their rare moment of conversation was interrupted, and Walter felt a pang of disappointment. But he smiled and stood up.

"Let's go. I'll go with you to the checkup."

Christina nodded and stood up gracefully, her expression calm.

To her, whether William was alive or dead no longer mattered.

In this new life, everything seemed so different and unfamiliar.

The William who once discarded her now longed for her attention.

It felt like a twist of fate, with past events fading into distant memories, no longer connected to her.

At the hospital.

Walter stayed by Christina's side, handling the registration and payments, bustling around, making Christina feel a bit guilty.

"Walter, I'm troubling you again," she said.

Walter's smile faltered for a moment but quickly returned to normal.

"I told you, there's no need to be so formal with me. If you keep this up, I'll really get mad."

Walter pretended to be angry, and Christina, feeling helpless, was about to speak.

The doctor nearby couldn't help but tease, "You two are quite polite for a couple. It's normal for a husband to accompany his wife to a prenatal checkup, isn't it?"

Christina's face turned red instantly. "We, we're not..."

Before she could finish saying "a couple," Walter interrupted.

"Doctor, sorry for the misunderstanding."

Walter's smile was polite and composed as he took the medical records from the doctor, listening carefully to all the precautions and guidelines for pregnant women.

Christina, standing beside him, felt both embarrassed and reassured.

She was grateful to have Walter with her. Otherwise, she would have been overwhelmed and might not have even managed to see a doctor.

After the checkup, Walter took Christina back to the villa in the suburbs.

The area was quiet, with most residents being wealthy and influential.

The landscaping was beautiful, and as Walter put it, it was a good place for her to rest and take care of her pregnancy.

Christina had nothing much to do lately, with the design competition still two months away.

Under Walter's insistence, she stayed there, eating well, drinking well, and attending her checkups on time.

In her spare time, she hid in the small study, seeking inspiration and preparing for the upcoming design competition.

But each time, she spent over two hours in the study.

This worried Walter. Seeing her emerge from the study looking exhausted once again, he took her by the hand and led her to the garden for a break.

"Christina, you need to take it easy," Walter said gently. "You can't overwork yourself, especially now."

Christina sighed. "I know, but I need to keep my mind occupied. Otherwise, I'll just keep thinking about everything."

Walter nodded, understanding. "I get it. But you have to find a balance. How about we take a walk? The fresh air will do you good."

Christina smiled faintly. "Alright, a walk sounds nice."

As they strolled through the garden, the tension in Christina's shoulders began to ease. Walter's presence was a comforting constant, and for the first time in a long while, she felt a glimmer of hope.

###chapter 183 Mr. William Cavendish, I Am Late

Christina felt overwhelmed by Walter's concern.

But as they walked, her mind began to clear.

For some reason, she thought of William, whose fate was still uncertain.

She realized her feelings were likely because she had once loved William, and he had saved her life.

Now, she decided to focus on living her own life well.

Walter walked beside Christina like a gentleman, smiling slightly as he turned his head.

"You won't find any inspiration stuck in your study. A walk outside might spark something, don't you think?"

Christina couldn't argue with that. She looked at the sunlight streaming from the horizon, feeling the breeze that brought her a sense of relaxation.

It was as if all her fatigue from the past days had vanished.

Suddenly, Christina's eyes lit up as she looked at the vast garden of flowers before her.

She had it!

The inspiration she had been searching for suddenly flooded her mind.

Without a second thought, she grabbed her phone and started typing furiously.

Walter, curious, asked, "What's going on?"

Christina put away her phone, smiling brightly.

"Thanks to you!"

Walter, understanding, smiled knowingly. "So, a walk did spark some inspiration, huh?"

"Yes!" Christina nodded enthusiastically, her smile unrestrained.

"If I win this design competition, I'll treat you to a big meal!"

Her radiant smile made Walter's heart skip a beat, and he nodded uncontrollably.

"Alright, I'll be looking forward to it!"

A month later, the design competition arrived as scheduled.

Inside the exhibition hall, Christina nervously clutched her USB drive, taking deep breaths.

"Come on, Christina, you can do this!"

Her colleague Skye, who worked with her at the architecture firm, cheered her on. "You've been preparing for this competition for over a month, and you're our firm's best designer. The championship is yours, relax!"

Feeling the warmth from Skye's hand, Christina nodded subconsciously.

"Alright, I'll take your word for it!"

Walter also smiled gently, offering his encouragement.

"Yeah, Christina is amazing. I'm still waiting for that celebratory dinner."

Skye immediately sensed some gossip and teased, "When did you plan this dinner? Christina, you're keeping secrets from me!"

Christina, flustered, was about to explain.

But Skye hooked her arm and giggled.

"Alright, alright, no need to explain. You're up next. Go on, we're waiting for your good news!"

Christina, helpless, nodded and took a deep breath, holding her USB drive.

She had prepared for this competition for so long. No matter what, she had to give it her all today!

As Christina stepped towards the stage, an unexpected mishap occurred-

Her not-so-high heels suddenly slipped!

Christina felt a sharp pain in her abdomen, the pain radiating downwards, causing her to stumble and nearly fall.

"Christina!" Walter caught her just in time.

"Are you okay?" he asked, his heart pounding as he noticed the beads of sweat on her pale face.

Her white dress was already stained with spots of blood.

"No, we need to get you to the hospital!" he said firmly, scooping her up and heading out without hesitation. He instructed his assistant to get the car ready.

This scene was captured in a photo.

Jennifer threw a stack of photos in front of William. "Look at this! Christina isn't worth your love! I love you so much, how can you not even look at me?"

William ignored Jennifer.

The photos on the ground meant nothing to him. As long as Christina was okay, that was all that mattered.

Just as Jennifer was about to lose it, Bob arrived with a team to rescue William. Seeing William trapped, Bob felt deeply guilty.

"Mr. Cavendish, I'm sorry I'm late."

William said nothing, but the moment he was freed, he headed straight for Christina.

Meanwhile, Christina was being examined by Joseph. "It's a good thing she was brought in quickly, or she would have lost the baby."

Walter remained silent.

The relationship between Christina and William was complicated. If the baby hadn't been saved, it might have spared Christina more pain. But the baby was safe, and that was good.

Just as Walter was keeping vigil by Christina's side, William arrived.

Seeing William, Walter said nothing and quietly stepped aside.

In a dimly lit bar, the lights reflected off the glassware, creating a colorful display.

Walter drank one glass after another.

He had only one thought: to drink away his sorrows.

Rhea sat beside him, her long legs crossed, looking at him with a half-smile.

"Is drowning your sorrows all you can do?"

Walter glanced at her.

"My business is none of your concern."

Rhea took a cigarette from her small, elegant purse, and a man immediately stepped forward to light it for her.

Rhea took a deep drag and blew the smoke in the man's face.

"Good timing. I'll find you later."

The man, thrilled, winked at her. "Alright, I'll be waiting. I won't disturb you now."

After he left, Rhea's expression turned disdainful. "Trying to play with me? Know your place!"

She turned to Walter, her eyes full of allure. "Even though you're back, I'm not ready to give up on you, Walter. Besides our business relationship, why not give me a chance?"

"I'm not interested in anything with a woman who forces herself on others." Walter put down his glass, counted out some bills, and slapped them on the table before staggering out.

Rhea grabbed her purse and followed.

"I can be whatever you want me to be!"

"No need," Walter said coolly. "Let's keep it professional. This is the end."

###chapter 184 Mutual Silence

Rhea bit her lip and stepped forward. "How do you know if you don't try? I'm beautiful too, and I'll offer the entire Moore Family as a dowry, just to make you smile."

Walter didn't like it and didn't respond directly to her words.

He turned and walked away, but after a few steps, the alcohol hit him, and he staggered.

Seeing this, Rhea rushed forward and steadied his swaying body.

Walter gently pushed her away.

Rhea raised an eyebrow. "What are you afraid of? Afraid I'll turn the tables on you? Let me take you home. If I leave you here, some other woman might snatch you up, and then I'd really lose out."

Walter didn't refuse and got into the car with Rhea.

How many times had he gotten drunk like this? Rhea glanced back and saw that he had already fallen asleep against the car window.

His handsome face looked so peaceful in the light.

She wished time could stop at this moment.

Rhea sighed and drove away.

When they arrived at the villa, Walter suddenly grabbed her hand and shouted unconsciously.

"Don't go!"

Rhea's heart leaped with joy. She immediately leaned forward, holding his hand. "Okay, I won't go. I'll stay with you all night."

Walter turned over and hugged her, resting his head on her chest, mumbling, "Christina, I've liked you for so long. Why won't you give me a chance and let William hurt you?"

He repeated it over and over, like a wound in his heart that would never heal.

Rhea's face changed.

"You like her that much? Even drunk, you keep thinking about her. Look at me. I've liked you for so long. Why won't you give me a chance?"

But the drunken Walter couldn't respond.

She said nothing more, just lay on his chest, feeling his strong heart beating.

Sometimes, that was enough.

Meanwhile, Christina, upon waking and seeing William, thought she was hallucinating.

It wasn't until William tightly held her hand that she realized it was real.

"Why are you back?"

She noticed William's pale face and bloodshot eyes.

He was even thinner than before.

Clearly, William had suffered terribly while Jennifer had him.

William's voice was hoarse. "Bob brought me back. Now you need to rest. Once you're better, you can get back to work."

Christina's gaze took in William's condition. He understood her thoughts but said nothing sentimental.

With memories of his past life, he only wanted Christina to be well.

Christina didn't ask for details. They both remained silent.

During her hospital stay, William never left her side.

After about two weeks, Christina was discharged.

She had to address her work, both at the architecture firm and in design.

Unexpectedly, Rhea found her.

The next day, Rhea appeared near the architecture firm.

In the sunlight, Rhea looked quite cheerful, with her long, wavy blonde hair, deep-set eyes, and tall figure, always drawing attention.

Rhea waved at her. "Got time to chat?"

Christina raised an eyebrow. Here, she wasn't afraid of Rhea. She smiled. "What do we have to talk about? Seems like there's nothing to discuss."

"We'll find out once we talk." Rhea smiled.

"Alright."

They went to a nearby restaurant.

The place had a nice atmosphere, with a cozy decor popular among the local professionals. It was after work hours, so it wasn't crowded. They found a secluded, clean spot.

After sitting down, Rhea ordered two signature coffees.

She took a sip and made a face. "Who drinks this coffee? It has no flavor!"

"The local workers. They come here for a break and a cup of coffee. Unlike you, with a castle hotel making millions, you wouldn't appreciate this small place's coffee. We're just here to talk, no need to fuss over the details," Christina said calmly.

Rhea lifted her chin. "True, the Moore Family's assets aren't just that castle. We have properties worldwide, including here, though not many. I used to think this place wasn't worth investing in, but now I see its potential. I might invest more here."

"That's great." Christina shrugged. "This place has long-term potential. If you're interested, you should invest. But that's not why you wanted to talk, is it?"

"You're smart. No wonder Walter likes you!" Rhea stared at her. "You're so beautiful. If your face were scarred, would he still like you?"

Christina knew Rhea's ways. Rhea had been lawless abroad, even kidnapping men to marry her. Christina feared she might break the law here too.

Christina said calmly, "Doing this will only make Walter like you less."

Rhea couldn't take it and slammed the table. "Are you threatening me? Do you think you're so great with all those admirers?"

If Rhea hadn't taken advantage of the situation, she wouldn't have gotten close to Walter. If Rhea hadn't interfered, Walter would have already gone back to Christina.

And Christina, married and involved with her brother-in-law, baffled Rhea. What did Walter see in her? Was it just because he couldn't have her?

Christina never thought so. In fact, some people's affection was a burden, like William's, or Walter's. She didn't want any ties to the Cavendish family.

But she couldn't deny Walter had helped her. If Walter found a good match, she would sincerely wish him well.

"I have nothing to say. To you, I'm just an outsider. Walter and I will never be together. You don't need to focus on me."

"But I have to. Walter always remembers you, always mentions you." Rhea leaned forward. Her face was almost touching Christina's, her eyes full of malice.

###chapter 185 Only Pain Will Not Be Forgotten

Christina gave a calm smile. "I don't like him. Guys always think the best ones are the ones they can't have. Once they get it, they don't appreciate it as much."

"So you're saying to him, you're just an unattainable regret?" Rhea crossed her arms.

"Exactly. Life moves on. You might like someone now, but eventually, you'll forget. If you hurt me, his first love dying would hit him hard." Christina chuckled softly.

In her past life, she had suffered greatly from her first love.

No matter what she said or did, in William's eyes, she was never as good as Jennifer. Of course, Jennifer's behind-the-scenes manipulations made Christina's life miserable. But things were different with Walter because Christina didn't like Walter and would never do anything to ruin their relationship.

Rhea's face darkened. She had thought Christina would be her biggest rival, but now it seemed Christina's feelings for Walter weren't as deep as Rhea had imagined.

"Do you really not like him?" Rhea asked again.

Christina put away her smile and nodded seriously. "Yeah, I don't have those feelings for him."

Rhea laughed, a seductive laugh that echoed like that night in the old castle.

After a while, she stopped laughing and stared at Christina. "Honestly, I never leave anyone who could threaten my relationship."

A hint of malice flashed in her eyes, as if her gaze could kill.

Then she twirled her hair and smiled gently. "But your words moved me. I don't want you to leave such a deep mark on his heart."

"Time will pass, love will fade, but maybe only pain won't be forgotten." Christina smiled faintly.

"But let's set some ground rules. If you break them, I won't hesitate to make you disappear."

Rhea narrowed her eyes and raised her first finger.

"I know it's impossible for you two to never meet, but you can't see him privately."

"Okay." Christina agreed readily.

She didn't want to get too close to Walter anyway, to avoid giving him any false hopes.

Rhea was surprised by her quick agreement and squinted suspiciously but said nothing. She raised her second finger.

"And you can't tell anyone about what happened abroad."

Christina thought for a moment and nodded. "Alright."

The matter had already been settled, and she didn't want to stir up old issues.

Rhea thought carefully. Besides keeping her away from Walter, she had no other demands from Christina.

After a while, she raised three fingers.

"I can't think of a third rule right now. I'll let you know later, but it won't be anything too difficult."

"I know you like Walter, so it's all about him. Don't worry, I'll keep my distance." Christina said calmly.

"Smart move." Rhea raised her coffee cup, took a sip, then pushed it aside in disgust.

Christina, being pregnant, didn't want to touch such things either, so she stood up.

"Anything else? I've got stuff to do, so I'm heading out."

Rhea raised an eyebrow.

"This should be our last conversation. I hope you keep your promise."

With that, Rhea left two dollars under her coffee cup and walked out.

She always had to be the first to leave.

Christina sighed and headed for the door.

To her surprise, a sleek sports car was parked outside the café, and Kingsley stepped out.

"I've been busy lately and haven't seen you in a while."

"You don't need to visit me. Helping your grandmother was just a small favor. You don't owe me anything." Christina smiled.

Kingsley mumbled, "That's not the only reason."

"What did you say?" Christina asked, puzzled.

"Nothing. Do you have time? My grandmother wants to invite you to dinner." Kingsley said.

"Well..." Christina hesitated.

She knew Kingsley was a good person, but she didn't want to seem like she was expecting something in return.

"It's just a meal. Grandma's been asking for a while, but I've been too busy with work. I couldn't find the time, and it wouldn't be sincere to send someone else."

Kingsley's sincerity was evident.

With his words, Christina felt she couldn't refuse.

She nodded. "Is it now? I didn't prepare anything, and it feels rude to go empty-handed."

"It's fine. We all enjoy your company." Kingsley smiled, opening the car door. "Please, get in."

Christina thought for a moment and then got in.

The car drove away from the café, heading to Kingsley's destination. The scenery outside the window flowed by, and Christina felt a sense of relief.

Lately, her life had revolved around the Cavendish family. Now, stepping away from it, she felt a sense of freedom.

Most people would choose a restaurant for such a meal, but the Rockefeller family seemed to prefer a more personal touch, inviting her to their estate.

The estate was beautiful, far from the bustling city, offering a sense of tranquility.

As the car entered the estate, Christina was captivated by the scenery. The landscaping was immaculate, with lush green grass, dense trees, and a babbling brook. Occasionally, small animals darted through the underbrush.

"This place is wonderful," Christina couldn't help but praise.

Kingsley smiled, guiding the car towards the main building. "Grandma loves it here. She says the air and environment are good for her health."

The car stopped at the main building's entrance. Kingsley got out first and opened the door for Christina.

As she stepped out, Kingsley's grandmother, Arabella Pearl, warmly greeted her.

"Christina, you're finally here. I've been waiting for you," Arabella's voice was warm and kind, making Christina feel a wave of warmth in her heart.

###chapter 186  It's Over Between Us

They were invited into a spacious, bright living room filled with antique furniture and decorations that gave off a warm, old-world charm.

Arabella welcomed them to sit down and then instructed the servants to prepare dinner.

"Christina, you and Kingsley are both young. You must have a lot in common, right?" Arabella said, watching Christina's expression closely.

Christina smiled politely. "Grandma, I only met Mr. Kingsley Rockefeller because of you. We do have a lot to talk about when it comes to architecture."

Kingsley smiled and added, "Christina is very smart. I always learn a lot when I'm with her."

Arabella patted her hand. "From now on, consider this place your home. No need to be so formal. Just call me Grandma and him Kingsley."

Christina glanced at Kingsley and nodded. "Alright."

The three of them chatted amiably, and soon dinner was ready.

The dining table was laden with delicious dishes. Christina, who had been struggling with her appetite during her pregnancy, found the food here surprisingly appetizing and ended up eating more than usual.

Arabella was delighted. "It's good to see you eating well."

After dinner, Arabella continued to chat with Christina for a long time, discussing everything from daily life to work experiences, and even Christina's family.

"Your father passed away so early. You and your mother must have had a hard time. It can't be easy living under someone else's roof."

Christina felt that Arabella genuinely cared for her, almost as if she were her own family. Though these topics were painful, she also remembered the happy times and smiled. "Grandma, you don't need to worry. When I was little, my parents treated me very well. I had the happiest family in the world. Later, when my mom married into the Cavendish family, I still had a good life."

Arabella touched her face gently. "But I can tell you haven't been happy lately. If there's anything bothering you, you can tell me."

Christina wanted to speak, but thinking about her troubles, she sighed. "Grandma, it's just that my work is so busy. It's overwhelming."

"Then leave the architecture firm and come work for the Rockefeller family as our chief designer," Arabella suggested.

Christina responded sincerely, "Grandma, I'm doing well at the firm. Mr. Fisher is a leading figure in the industry. I can learn a lot from him, and he was also my father's mentor. I want to stay there, but I appreciate your offer."

Arabella had no choice but to pat her hand. "Alright, but visit me often."

"Okay," Christina nodded.

After dinner, she wandered around the estate. Arabella encouraged her to explore, as the place was an old building with a lot of historical value.

On the third floor, she saw a large oil painting of a man and a woman who appeared to be in their thirties. For some reason, their faces felt very familiar to her.

"Do you think you look like them?" Kingsley asked, walking up beside her.

Christina snapped out of her thoughts and smiled faintly. "Yeah, a bit. There's something about the eyes."

"They're my parents. Grandma says my mom was gentle and capable, a really gracious woman. She and Grandma were closer than Grandma was with my dad."

"And what happened to them?" Christina asked instinctively.

Kingsley's eyes darkened. "They died in an accident."

"What?" Christina was shocked.

"It was a long time ago. We've mostly moved on," Kingsley explained, not wanting her to feel bad for asking.

"And Grandma managed this huge estate all by herself? That must've been tough," Christina remarked.

"Yeah," Kingsley smiled. "The hardest part was that my parents' daughter went missing."

Christina was surprised to learn this about the Rockefeller family and even more surprised that Kingsley shared it with her. "When did that happen?"

"Many years ago," Kingsley sighed. "Grandma has always hoped to find that child."

"I see. But after so many years with no news..." Christina started to say, but then realized she shouldn't be pessimistic in front of him and changed her tone. "Good people are always protected by God. That girl will come back."

Kingsley nodded. "Yeah, we should have some leads soon."

Christina smiled. "That's good to hear!"

As night fell, the lights in the estate glowed warmly. Kingsley walked Christina back to her place.

"Thanks for today. I had a great time," Christina said to Kingsley.

Kingsley smiled. "Me too. Grandma was happy, so I'm happy. Can you come by more often to keep her company? You look a lot like my mom."

Christina felt touched and nodded. "Sure, Grandma is very knowledgeable. I'd love to chat with her."

After they said their goodbyes, Christina returned to her place alone.

The room was dark, and she thought no one was there. But as soon as she walked in, the lights came on, and she saw William sitting on the couch.

"Why are you back so late?"

"I went out with a friend," Christina replied calmly, not wanting to argue.

But William pressed on, "Was your friend a man or a woman?"

Christina rolled her eyes. "I don't think that's any of your business. I don't need to answer that."

William stood up. "You're my wife. I'm just asking about your whereabouts."

"Don't forget, we're in the middle of divorce proceedings," Christina said, looking him in the eye. "I don't need to report to you, and you have no right to know where I go. You're nothing but a liar."

William hesitated.

Christina's stance was clear. She was completely disillusioned with William. All the good times and hopes had been replaced by his deceit and betrayal.

William looked at her, a complex emotion flashing in his eyes, but he quickly suppressed it. "I'm just worried about you, Christina. You should understand my feelings."

"Your feelings?" Christina scoffed. "Your feelings are nothing but lies and betrayal. I'm done, William. We're over."

###chapter 187 Do Not Rush

Hearing her resolute words, William felt a chill in his heart.

"Is there really no way back for us? Christina, I want to be a good father."

"William, after everything I've been through, how can you say that? I'm telling you, you will never be my child's father," Christina replied with a cold laugh.

William pressed on, "Then who do you want to be the father? Walter? Or the guy who just dropped you off?"

"Enough, stop saying these things," Christina snapped, her voice filled with irritation. "What I plan to do is none of your business!"

William's face darkened. He hadn't expected Christina to be so determined. He took a deep breath, trying to control his emotions.

"Christina, do you really think you can get rid of me so easily? Our marriage isn't something you can just end whenever you want," William said, his voice carrying a hint of threat.

A flicker of helplessness crossed Christina's eyes, but it was quickly replaced by determination. "I've already hired a lawyer to handle the divorce. If you don't agree, we can settle this in court."

William was momentarily taken aback but quickly regained his composure.

"Fine, if that's what you want, then I'll see you in court," William said before turning and leaving Christina's room.

Christina watched his retreating figure, feeling an overwhelming sense of exhaustion.

At the Rockefeller estate, Arabella had thoughtfully placed the spoon Christina used into a bag.

Seeing Kingsley return, she handed him the bag.

"Go get a DNA test."

Kingsley nodded. "Alright, no problem."

As Kingsley was about to leave, Arabella stopped him.

"Wait."

Kingsley turned back, puzzled. "What's wrong, Grandma? Didn't we agree to find out her identity this way without disturbing her?"

A look of fatigue and worry crossed her eyes.

"We've tried so many times over the years, tested so many people, but we've always come up empty. I'm afraid..."

Kingsley understood that Arabella feared another disappointment. This was something they had to do, but she was scared to face it.

"Grandma, no matter what, we need to know the truth," Kingsley said gently.

Arabella sighed deeply. "Maybe we should just let it go. If I don't know the result, I won't be disappointed. I can love her as my granddaughter, but if it turns out she's not, I don't think I can handle it."

She was old now, and years of searching had left her exhausted.

"Besides, from what Christina has told me about her family, it doesn't seem like she was raised by adoptive parents. Let's just leave it."

She had made up her mind.

"No more tests. I'll just treat her as my granddaughter."

Kingsley looked at his grandmother's aged but resolute face, feeling a surge of complex emotions.

He knew that her years of searching had carried too much hope and disappointment, and now, choosing to give up might be her way of protecting herself from further pain.

But he also knew this was a crucial opportunity, possibly their only chance to find the truth. He took a deep breath, deciding to try persuading her one more time.

"Grandma, I know this decision is tough, but if we don't try, we'll never know. Maybe Christina really is family. We can't just give up on this chance," Kingsley said firmly.

Arabella shook her head, her eyes filled with deep helplessness. "Kingsley, I get it, but I'm really scared. Scared of being disappointed again, scared I can't handle it. I'd rather love her as my granddaughter than go through that pain again."

Kingsley felt torn. He understood his grandmother's feelings but didn't want to give up.

He was silent for a moment, then spoke slowly. "Grandma, I understand your concerns, but we can't let the truth stay hidden."

Arabella listened to her grandson's words, feeling conflicted. She saw the determination in Kingsley's eyes, knowing he was right, but her heart ached as if pricked by needles.

"Grandma, we can take it slow. There's no rush," Kingsley continued to persuade.

Arabella was silent for a long time, her inner struggle and pain evident. Finally, she waved her hand. "Fine, you decide."

Kingsley helped her upstairs to rest.

Because Christina was pregnant, the lawsuit was dragging on. She had been struggling for over a month with no progress.

Kaitlyn, on the other hand, was nowhere to be seen.

Christina had asked her a few times, and Kaitlyn said she was dating. But this time, she was purposefully choosing men from good families, avoiding any suspicious characters.

Stanley had said some things that made sense. Just because one person didn't like her, she shouldn't devalue herself.

Kaitlyn gradually came to terms with it. Her grandfather was influential, and she didn't need to be fixated on Stanley. Maybe using her status for a strategic marriage wasn't a bad idea.

"Grandpa, this guy isn't handsome enough. Didn't I tell you? I want a handsome man. How else am I supposed to spend the rest of my life?" Kaitlyn complained on the phone after a date.

"Handsome and successful men are rare. You didn't like any of my students," Kelvin replied helplessly.

"Don't even start. Except for..." Kaitlyn trailed off.

Yes, only Stanley fit the bill. Young, accomplished, tall, handsome, and talented.

But he didn't like her, and now he was in Eldoria. Who knows what the sun over there would do to him? Maybe he'd come back looking terrible, and she wouldn't like him anymore!

Maybe.

Kelvin picked up on her underlying meaning. "By the way, Stanley is coming back next Monday."

"What does that have to do with me? I couldn't care less," Kaitlyn huffed.

"Alright, if you don't care, I won't say anything," Kelvin teased.

Kaitlyn, sensing there might be something important, couldn't help but be curious. "Grandpa, just tell me. I'll listen, since he's my senior."

"He got a bacterial infection over there. The medical conditions weren't good, so he's coming back," Kelvin sighed.

"Is his life in danger?" Kaitlyn asked anxiously.

Kelvin shook his head. "He should be fine."

###chapter 188  Getting Married Just for This?

Kaitlyn said that, but she was still really worried.

In two days, it would be Monday. Kaitlyn had asked Kelvin which hospital Stanley would be treated at once he returned.

After Kelvin told her, he asked, "Are you planning to visit him?"

Kaitlyn smirked. "No way. Don't forget, you set me up to meet that Irvin Hays from the city planning department on Monday. I have high hopes for that meeting, Grandpa. Don't let me down."

"Of course," Kelvin chuckled.

On Monday, Kaitlyn sat in a café, constantly checking the time.

By now, Stanley should have been taken to the hospital for treatment. She wondered how he was doing. Would he survive? Her worry grew stronger, especially since her date was already late.

Just as she was about to leave, a well-dressed man appeared in front of her. "Miss Fisher? I'm so sorry, I got stuck in traffic."

Kaitlyn had no patience left. "It's fine. You've already made a bad impression. The date is off."

"Miss Fisher, I know first impressions are important. Please, give me another chance," Irvin said politely, his handsome face sincere.

After thinking it over, Kaitlyn nodded. "Alright, I'll give you another chance. I have somewhere I need to go. Come with me."

"It would be my pleasure," Irvin replied.

Kaitlyn was heading to the hospital.

Kelvin had found out all the details, so she knew exactly where to go. She went straight to Stanley's room.

The moment she saw Stanley, her eyes reddened. He had lost weight, his bones more prominent, making him look even more delicate.

Stanley brightened up when he saw her, his eyes sparkling with joy. "It's great to see you on my first day back."

"Really? I thought you'd find me annoying. By the way, I'm not here alone," Kaitlyn said, glancing outside.

Irvin, who had just parked the car, walked in quickly.

"Let me introduce you. This is my boyfriend, Irvin Hays. We met on a date, and he's been very good to me," Kaitlyn said with a bright smile.

Stanley's face darkened instantly. "He seems like a great guy. You two look good together."

Hearing this, Kaitlyn felt a pang of discomfort, but she had made her choice and couldn't backtrack now.

"My grandpa said your condition was serious. Are you okay?" she asked.

Stanley shook his head. "I'm fine. It was just a bacterial infection. The conditions over there were poor, so coming back for treatment was a blessing in disguise. I'm relieved to be here."

"That's good!" Kaitlyn took a deep breath and decided to push further. "Since you're staying, you can attend my wedding with Irvin."

What? She was getting married so soon?

Stanley felt a mix of emotions. It wasn't that he only realized her value after losing her, but during his lonely days in Eldoria, he missed Kaitlyn's presence more than anything.

He finally understood that when someone becomes a habit in your life, it's easy to take them for granted. But realizing this after leaving seemed too late.

"I've only been gone a month. Before I left, you didn't even know Irvin. Isn't getting married this quickly a bit rash?" Stanley said, feeling heartbroken.

"What's rash about it? Our families know each other well. He's a young talent, good-looking, and my type," Kaitlyn replied, suddenly feeling something was off.

She tilted her head. "Are you jealous?"

"No, as your senior, I just feel responsible for your major life decisions. But if both families approve, I have no reason to worry," Stanley said, shaking his head.

After saying this, he coughed heavily, clearly exhausted.

Since he didn't try to stop her, the small flame of hope in Kaitlyn's heart finally extinguished.

"I was supposed to go on a date with Irvin today, but Grandpa said you were back. I thought it wouldn't be right not to visit. Now that I know you're okay, I'll leave."

"Alright," Stanley nodded.

Kaitlyn linked arms with Irvin and quickly walked out.

As soon as they reached the door, she let go.

"Sorry about that."

"Do you like that guy in the hospital bed?" Irvin asked.

Kaitlyn lied casually. "No, I just wanted to prove I'm doing better than him. I have a new boyfriend and a new life. It's a matter of pride."

"Doesn't seem like it," Irvin teased with a smile.

Kaitlyn, full of energy, continued confidently.

"I never liked him. If you don't believe me, why don't you marry me? My grandpa wants me to find someone suitable. You're in the city planning department, and my family has been in construction for generations. We're a perfect match!"

"Isn't that a bit hasty? You don't even know me well," Irvin laughed.

"Yes, but do you dare?" Kaitlyn always had that kind of courage.

She was ready to step into marriage, willing to take risks.

Irvin smiled. "As a woman, you have more to lose in marriage. If you're brave enough to do this, why wouldn't I be?"

"Great!" Kaitlyn smiled. "Let's tell our parents when we get back."

Irvin nodded but glanced back at the hospital room.

True to her word, Kaitlyn immediately informed her friends and family.

Christina was shocked when she got the news.

"You're getting married so soon? To whom?"

"I found the right person, so naturally, I want to get married. I hope to have a lovely daughter," Kaitlyn said with a smile.

"You're getting married just for that? He's supposed to be your partner for life. You should be sure," Christina sighed.

She wanted to persuade Kaitlyn, but Kaitlyn was determined.

"I've made up my mind, Christina. Don't try to change it. Just come to my wedding and be happy for me, okay? The groom is great. You'll see."

Marriage is something only the people involved can truly understand. Before anything happens, Christina couldn't say much more.

"Alright, I'll be there, happy and supportive," Christina agreed.

###chapter 189  We'll See How You Perform

Kaitlyn and Irvin's marriage could truly be described as a whirlwind romance.

They met on the first day, and within three days, they had invited all their friends and family. They didn't even bother with fancy invitations; the whole event was pretty simple.

But with the combined efforts of their families, they still managed to put together a beautiful wedding.

Before Kaitlyn's wedding, Christina made a special trip to visit her new home.

Kaitlyn was staring blankly at herself in the mirror. Her reflection was beautiful, but she looked unhappy.

Christina walked over.

"You're about to get married, and you're having second thoughts?"

"No, Christina, I was just thinking about what I should eat after I finish my makeup," Kaitlyn forced a smile.

"Others might not see it, but I can tell," Christina sighed.

"Christina, I've always been this way-impulsive. Once I make a decision, I stick to it without a doubt," Kaitlyn said, her mood a bit uneasy. "I do admire Irvin, and he fits my aesthetic perfectly. But now that the wedding is imminent, I feel like this decision was a bit hasty."

Christina sighed again. "Do you still like him?"

"I thought I didn't, but after not seeing him for a month, I realized I missed him terribly. But he doesn't like me. Maybe I can marry someone else and develop feelings later. Love might just be a seasoning in life," Kaitlyn said, adjusting her hair in the mirror. "Anyway, once I decide on something, I never look back or regret it."

Christina had met Irvin once.

He came to pick up Kaitlyn. He was indeed a good person, polite and respectful to everyone, despite coming from a wealthy family.

"You're with a genuinely good person. You'll definitely be happy, Kaitlyn!" Christina smiled.

Kaitlyn nodded at her reflection.

But just then, a wedding staff member came in. "The groom is missing."

Kaitlyn was stunned. "Wasn't he outside preparing?"

"And the banner outside has been changed," the staff member said, unsure how to explain.

"Changed? How?" Kaitlyn was surprised.

"The name has been changed," the staff member said, confused about how the groom's name could change right before the wedding.

Kaitlyn stood up. "I'll go check."

As she walked down the hallway, she saw Stanley in a white suit.

He had lost some weight but still looked handsome and upright, holding a bouquet of white roses as he walked toward her.

"Kaitlyn, I know it might be too late to say this now, but during my time in Eldoria, I felt like something was missing. It was your laughter that left a void in my heart. Sometimes, it takes leaving to realize you've left a mark on my heart," Stanley said.

"What are you doing? I'm about to get married," Kaitlyn turned her face away.

"Irvin told me everything. The day you came to see me was the first time you met him," Stanley said hesitantly.

"So what? That doesn't mean we won't be happy," Kaitlyn said firmly.

"Kaitlyn, I know it might be too late, but I still want to try. I don't want to regret missing this chance for the rest of my life," Stanley said, his voice steady.

"Would you really regret missing me for the rest of your life?" Kaitlyn looked at him, searching his eyes.

Stanley nodded, his determination clear. "Absolutely. I would deeply regret it."

Kaitlyn felt a sense of satisfaction and made up her mind. "Alright, let's be clear, you're the one pursuing me."

"Okay," Stanley agreed without hesitation. "It's me, Stanley, pursuing Kaitlyn. Thank you, Kaitlyn, for giving me this chance."

Kaitlyn stepped closer. "And when we get married, you have to listen to me."

Stanley accepted everything. "Deal!"

No matter what Kaitlyn demanded, he was ready to agree.

People might be confused at times, but once they figure things out and bravely pursue them, everything can be regained.

Both families had already discussed this, so the wedding proceeded smoothly, with guests none the wiser. They exchanged vows and rings under the priest's witness.

After greeting the guests, Kaitlyn approached Irvin gratefully. "Thank you for putting up with my antics."

"No problem. Life is meant to be spent with someone you love. Our families are close, so helping you was easy. How do you feel now?" Irvin asked with a smile.

"I feel like the happiest woman in the world," Kaitlyn laughed brightly.

"If you didn't have someone in your heart, I'd want to get to know you better, Kaitlyn," Irvin said seriously.

"Please, I'm married now. Don't say things like that," Kaitlyn rolled her eyes.

Irvin laughed. "Just kidding."

Most of the guests had left, and Christina was about to leave too.

But Kaitlyn hugged her, reluctant to let go. "Christina, stay with me, please?"

"You just got married. Do you still need company? It's your wedding night. I shouldn't intrude," Christina glanced at Stanley behind her.

Kaitlyn looked over and pouted. "I've chased him for so long. What's wrong with making him wait a bit?"

"Why do I sense some revenge in your words?" Christina joked.

"I am getting revenge," Kaitlyn whispered.

Christina smiled helplessly. "Then why did you marry him?"

"I married him because I like him, but I still need to get my revenge," Kaitlyn laughed.

Stanley couldn't hold back any longer and walked over quickly. "Can I borrow my wife for a moment?"

"She's yours, no need to borrow. I won't intrude. Congratulations on your wedding," Christina said seriously, then waved and left quickly.

Kaitlyn raised an eyebrow. "Are you serious?"

"Of course. This is the boldest decision of my life, Kaitlyn!" Stanley hugged her.

"I agreed to marry you so the guests wouldn't leave empty-handed. I didn't agree to live happily ever after with you," Kaitlyn said proudly.

Stanley was anxious. "What will it take for you to agree?"

Kaitlyn thought for a moment, then lifted her chin slightly. "We'll see how you do."

###chapter 190 Nicholas is in Trouble

Christina had just stepped out of the wedding venue when William's car pulled up.

"Something's up at home. We gotta go back."

"Why should I care?" Christina's tone was frosty.

"Enough. Everyone," William said sharply. "We have to go back. You haven't divorced me yet."

Christina studied him closely.

He looked serious, with a deep furrow in his brow, like something was really wrong.

Even though she didn't want to get tangled up with the Cavendish family, Elisa was still there. If something serious had happened, she should at least check it out.

During the drive, William's brow stayed furrowed, like he had a lot on his mind.

Christina had a feeling something big was going down with the Cavendish family, but she didn't ask.

When they arrived, almost everyone from the Cavendish family was there.

Zaid Cavendish, the eldest brother, stepped forward. "William, you're finally back. We haven't finished discussing the previous matter."

"Enough. Now's not the time for this," William said curtly.

The atmosphere was tense.

"I'll go check on my mom," Christina said, knowing she didn't belong in this setting. She excused herself and went upstairs.

Elisa, looking worried, came over and took her hand.

"This family is falling apart."

"What happened?" Christina asked, confused.

Elisa sighed deeply. "They're fighting over the inheritance. The Cavendish family shares are scattered, and the business is huge. Nicholas is old and can't manage everything anymore."

No wonder William hadn't been around much lately; this was the reason.

Christina wasn't concerned about such matters. "Mom, let them fight. My salary is more than enough for us. If we can't stay with the Cavendish family, I can take you away."

"But..." Elisa sighed.

"Mom, we shouldn't get involved in this. Whatever Raymond decides is his business," Christina said seriously.

"You're married to William now. You should have a share of the inheritance," Elisa said, taking a deep breath. "With that, you'd never have to worry about money again."

"But I don't need it," Christina began to say, but there was a knock on the door.

She opened it to find a servant standing outside.

"Mr. Nicholas Cavendish wants to see you."

The servant's words were directed at Christina.

Christina was surprised. Nicholas had never been kind to her, even after she married William. He was always wary of her. What could he want now?

But since he had asked, she couldn't refuse.

She nodded. "Okay."

Nicholas's health was indeed poor. As soon as she entered, he was coughing continuously. Christina waited quietly for him to catch his breath before speaking.

"What do you need from me?"

"You've been planning this for a long time, and now you've successfully married William. Seeing me so weak, ready to die at any moment, you must be pleased," Nicholas said, staring into her eyes.

Christina chuckled. "I've never thought that way."

"You know what you think," Nicholas said, not buying it.

Christina knew that ever since the initial incident, the Cavendish family had always been suspicious of her. So she didn't bother to explain. They could think whatever they wanted; it had nothing to do with her.

Seeing her silence, Nicholas coughed heavily again. "With the family in such chaos, don't even think about the inheritance."

"I've never thought about it. By the way, William married me while I had amnesia. I'm currently discussing divorce with him," Christina said with a cold smile.

Nicholas didn't believe her. "You tricked him into marrying you. How could you let go so easily?"

"I'm just saying this to clear your doubts. If you don't believe me, that's fine," Christina said, turning to leave.

Nicholas called her back.

"What are you after?"

"Ever since my mother and I entered the Cavendish family, you've suspected us of being after money, guarding against us for years," Christina said with a bitter smile. "But let me be clear, your will can exclude me."

Nicholas, seeing this, said in a deep voice, "You're playing the long game."

Christina found it laughable. "Even now, you're still wary of me. Do you think that after you die, I'll take William's share?"

Nicholas felt a pang of sadness. The family was in turmoil, with constant fights over the inheritance.

And the shares his sons held had caused countless upheavals in the company. Though old, he wasn't blind or deaf; he could still see and hear.

At this point, he had to worry more about his children.

"I don't care about your marriage to William or your divorce. But whether you marry or divorce, you need to sign a prenuptial agreement."

What she hadn't gone through before, she had to go through now.

Christina wasn't surprised and agreed readily. "Sure, I'll write it."

Nicholas had prepared paper and pen. She walked over and wrote a formal agreement, signing her name and pressing her fingerprint at the end.

She handed it to Nicholas.

"Is this okay?"

"Yes," Nicholas said, nodding after a glance. He leaned on his cane and stood up wearily. "You're dismissed."

Called when needed, dismissed when not. That was the Cavendish family's attitude toward everyone.

Christina simply said, "Take care," and quickly left.

As she closed the door, she caught a glimpse of a shadow slipping into the adjacent room.

Someone had been eavesdropping, trying to hear their conversation. But since it wasn't about the inheritance, she didn't think it mattered.

She went to be with Elisa.

But in the middle of the night, the entire Cavendish household was in an uproar.

Servants were running up and down in a panic. "Something's wrong! Nicholas is in trouble!"

Elisa woke up with a start, propping herself up. "What's going on?"

By the time they dressed and went out, chaos had erupted. An ambulance had arrived.

The doctor went straight to Nicholas's room, but after a brief attempt at resuscitation, he came out to announce regretfully to everyone.

"Nicholas has no vital signs."

No one could believe it. How could Nicholas die now? Suddenly, someone in the crowd said, "Christina met with Nicholas alone this afternoon. She did it!"

###chapter 191 Standing by Her Side

"How could that be?" Walter immediately stood by Christina's side.

He was sure Christina couldn't have done something like that.

He wasn't about to let her be falsely accused of such a crime.

"What does this have to do with you?" Gabrielle quickly intervened. "You just got home, Walter. You don't know anything about this. Stay out of it."

Nicholas's sudden death was undeniable, and Christina being the prime suspect was also a fact.

The whole family was in chaos, and Gabrielle didn't want her son siding with Christina.

What if he got implicated?

For someone like Christina, it wasn't worth the risk.

Gabrielle, worried her son wouldn't listen, pretended to feel faint. "I'm feeling dizzy, Walter. Help me to the living room."

Walter had no choice but to comply.

The others continued to gang up on Christina.

"It had to be her. After he saw her this afternoon, Nicholas didn't see anyone else."

"You never really know someone. Who would've thought she was such a bad woman?"

Facing these accusations, Christina naturally wouldn't admit to anything. "You're calling me a murderer, but can you provide any evidence? If you can't, then you're just slandering me!"

"Besides, I had no grudge against Nicholas. Why would I want to harm him?"

She just wanted to leave this place and cut ties with everyone here. She had no motive to harm Nicholas.

And besides, she wasn't capable of murder.

"Why would you harm Nicholas? We all know why. Who can't see it? You just wanted his inheritance!" Zaid scoffed.

After Nicholas fell ill, the family gathered, supposedly to take care of him.

But in reality, who wasn't there for the inheritance?

The money was secondary; the key was Nicholas's shares in the company. Even a small portion would ensure a comfortable life for the rest of their days.

Their descendants would also benefit from the company's dividends.

As for Christina, everyone knew she hadn't been included in the inheritance.

Nicholas had reluctantly agreed to let her in, but he never truly accepted her.

"Now that Nicholas didn't leave you anything, you held a grudge and took the chance to kill him while we were all asleep!" Zaid declared confidently.

His words resonated with everyone.

Christina was already the prime suspect, and now she had a motive. The conclusion seemed obvious.

"Nicholas was definitely killed by you. You're the murderer!"

"What kind of twisted logic is that?" Christina was exasperated. "I willingly signed a prenuptial agreement. The Cavendish family's money has nothing to do with me, and I have no interest in the Cavendish Corporation. If I were after money, I wouldn't be acting like this."

If she were after money, she would be like Elisa, constantly trying to please William and Nicholas to stay in the Cavendish family.

But no one present believed her.

Elisa wanted to speak up for her, but Zaid shot her a cold look. "Are you even part of the Cavendish family? Do you have a say here?"

"I..." Elisa's lips trembled.

Though she had married into the Cavendish family as Nicholas's daughter-in-law, she had brought a daughter with her.

A second marriage was always different.

A cold voice suddenly cut through the tension.

"Do I have a say here?"

It was William.

Seeing him, Zaid's demeanor shifted. His tone softened. "William, I know you and Christina are newlyweds and very much in love. If it were anything else, we wouldn't care. We'd turn a blind eye. But this is about Nicholas. This is a matter of life and death!"

"If Christina really killed Nicholas, I will make sure you get an explanation. But right now, there's no evidence proving she's the murderer, is there?" William countered.

"The truth hasn't been uncovered yet. I won't allow anyone to bully my wife."

Zaid opened his mouth, then closed it, momentarily speechless.

The truth was right in front of them, but William refused to believe it.

What could they do if he insisted on deceiving himself?

"William, you're just protecting Christina, aren't you?"

"Exactly. I always thought she was trouble, bringing nothing but curses to the Cavendish family. First, she caused your car accident, and now she's killed Nicholas. Ever since she came, the Cavendish family hasn't had a moment of peace."

"Anyway, you have to give us an explanation today. We can't let a murderer go free."

Others chimed in.

With Nicholas gone, some of them were eager to seize more benefits.

And if Christina was indeed the murderer, William would be implicated too. If he was kicked out of the Cavendish family, his shares and assets would be up for grabs.

For these reasons, they were determined to make things difficult for him.

Despite the harassment, William stood firmly in front of Christina, not budging an inch.

"I said I would get to the bottom of this. If Christina is the murderer, I won't cover for her. We'll face the consequences together," William reiterated.

Zaid, afraid he might go back on his word, quickly repeated, "William, you said it yourself. When the truth comes out, don't deny it."

"I stand by my word. For now, let's handle Nicholas's funeral," William said coldly, scanning the room.

With his assurance, the others stopped causing trouble and gathered around Nicholas, crying as they bid him farewell.

The living room was filled with the sound of sobbing.

Taking advantage of the moment, Elisa pulled Christina aside. "Listen to me. William is willing to protect you now, so you should keep him happy. With Nicholas gone, he's the most influential person in the Cavendish family. As long as he wants to protect you, you'll be fine."

"Mom," Christina frowned.

She knew what Elisa meant-she wanted her to please William.

But she wasn't willing to do that.

She told Elisa directly, "I didn't harm Nicholas, and I'm not a murderer. I won't accept this accusation. Even without William, I believe the police will clear my name."

###chapter 192  Intense Helplessness

"Why are you so stubborn?" Elisa's frustration was clear as she glared at Christina.

She just couldn't wrap her head around it.

William wasn't bad-looking, he was young and successful, the kind of guy most women would dream of marrying. Plenty of women would jump at the chance to be with him.

But Christina had to be different.

"Especially now, with everyone saying you're a murderer. Only William can protect you. If you don't stick with him, what are you gonna do? Keep being stubborn?" Elisa's anger grew with each word.

She clutched her chest. "Even if you don't care about yourself, don't you care about me? I'm a terminal cancer patient. How can you let your own mother, a cancer patient, worry about you?"

Christina felt a wave of helplessness wash over her.

When everyone else was giving her a hard time, she could stand up to them. She knew she hadn't done anything wrong and wouldn't let anyone slander her.

But facing Elisa, she was at a loss.

If she tried to reason with her, Elisa wouldn't listen. If she spoke too harshly, Elisa was a terminal cancer patient.

She couldn't ignore that.

"Anyway, the family's busy with Nicholas's funeral, and I've said all I can. Think carefully and don't do something you'll regret." Elisa added a few more words before finally falling silent.

She stopped talking, but the family issues were far from over.

Given Nicholas's status, neither William nor the rest of the Cavendish family would allow a hasty burial.

After the coroner's report, the funeral was set for the next day.

Christina and Elisa rode over, but the Cavendish family wouldn't let them out of the car.

Zaid was firm. "William, we've already made concessions because of you. We didn't immediately send Christina to the police, but letting her attend Nicholas's funeral is out of the question!"

Bringing the suspected murderer to Nicholas's funeral? That was unthinkable.

"Besides, Nicholas didn't like her. If he knew she was at his funeral, he'd probably rise from the grave in anger!"

William didn't want Christina to face hostility, so he didn't argue.

Elisa stayed in the car with her.

The car was cramped, and thinking about the looks they received earlier, Elisa felt a heavy weight on her chest. She couldn't stop sighing.

But worse was yet to come.

News of Nicholas's death hit the internet, and initially, netizens didn't pay much attention.

Then someone anonymously posted that Christina married into the Cavendish family for money, and when she couldn't get the inheritance, she killed Nicholas in a fit of rage.

She was the murderer!

The news spread like wildfire, and netizens were in an uproar.

"Oh my God, what kind of high-society drama is this? She killed for money? That's ruthless."

"I heard she's a student. She wouldn't do something like that, right? This must be a rumor."

"Are you kidding? If she were that innocent, she wouldn't have married into a wealthy family so young."

"Even if she doesn't get the death penalty, she should face legal consequences. Spending the rest of her life in prison would serve her right. A gold digger ends up with nothing."

"She's lucky if she only goes to prison. The Cavendish family isn't ordinary; they have ways to deal with her."

By the time William got a call from his assistant during the funeral, the online backlash was intense.

"Mr. Cavendish, the entire internet is condemning Ms. Windsor. I tried to suppress the news, but they bought trending spots, and the public interest is too high. What should we do?" The assistant sounded desperate.

Today's netizens were sharp and rebellious. The more he tried to suppress the news, the more they discussed it.

"Contact the entertainment media. If they don't want to offend me, they should stay out of this. Do whatever it takes to suppress the news." William was determined to protect Christina.

They had known each other in two lifetimes.

He knew Christina's character better than anyone and knew she couldn't have done this.

Moreover, he felt he owed Christina and her mother from their past life.

This time, he would protect her at all costs and clear her name.

"Yes, Mr. Cavendish. I'll handle it." The assistant hung up and sighed.

William had sacrificed so much for Christina.

After the funeral, William wanted to rush home to see Christina.

He wanted to tell her that he would handle everything and she didn't need to worry.

But Zaid stopped him again. "Have you seen the news online? We can give you some time, but the public won't. If Christina stays with the Cavendish family, it will affect all of us, even the company's stock price!"

The company's stock price was crucial to everyone.

They held shares, and a high stock price meant their assets appreciated. Conversely, their assets would plummet if the stock price fell.

This was real money coming out of their pockets. It wasn't just Zaid; everyone else couldn't tolerate it either.

"Nicholas favored you when he was alive, giving you the most assets. You don't lack money and don't care about the stock price, but we do."

"If you insist on protecting Christina, fine. Share your stocks with us to compensate for our losses, and we won't say anything."

"We won't fuss over the properties Nicholas left you, but the company shares are a different matter."

William knew exactly what they were up to.

They were taking advantage of the situation.

But they had him by his only weakness, Christina.

"If you don't want to share, then send Christina to the police. When you find evidence of her innocence, you can bring her back, and we won't say anything." Zaid added.

William couldn't accept sending Christina to the police.

But he had no choice. Before the guests left, the police arrived and asked, "We received a report. Where is the suspect, Christina?"

"She's in that car over there." Zaid immediately led the way.

###chapter 193 Taken Away for Investigation

The police officer opened the car door and flashed the handcuffs, ready to take Christina away.

"My daughter hasn't hurt anyone. She's innocent! What are you doing?" Elisa rushed forward, trying to stop them.

She stood protectively in front of Christina. "You're police officers. You should be upholding justice, not falsely accusing good people."

"Your daughter is a suspect. We're taking her in for questioning. We're not convicting her right now," the officer explained patiently.

Elisa wasn't having any of it.

"Then wait until you've investigated and confirmed that my daughter is guilty. Only then can you take her away. You have no evidence right now, just a guess. Taking my daughter away like this is killing me! I'm a terminal cancer patient. How can you do this to me?"

"Ma'am, please don't make this difficult," the officer said, exasperated.

They were following protocol.

Even if the suspect's family member was terminally ill, they couldn't make exceptions.

If they made an exception today, how would they handle cases in the future?

"You come from nothing and have no status here," Zaid sneered from the side. "If you really care about your daughter, why don't you go with her? This is a society governed by law. Are we supposed to listen to you instead of the police?"

Elisa was left speechless by the mockery.

William couldn't just stand by and watch Christina being taken away.

He wanted to step forward to protect Christina.

But Christina pushed Elisa aside and held out her hands to the police. "I'll go with you. I haven't done anything wrong. I'm not afraid of your investigation. Go ahead and check. Once you find out the truth, you'll let me go."

"Christina!" Elisa was frantic.

But there was nothing she could do.

She watched helplessly as Christina got into the police car, which then sped away.

Now, her only hope was William.

"Don't worry too much. Like your wife said, she hasn't hurt anyone. Once the investigation is over, they'll let her go. The police won't make things difficult for her in a lawful society," Knox Cavendish, the second brother of the Cavendish family, said with a hint of sarcasm.

Knox was more interested in getting William to share his shares with the family than in Christina being taken away.

But Knox was disappointed.

If Knox couldn't be happy, he didn't want anyone else to be happy either. He was deliberately provoking William.

William's eyes narrowed.

The police had come at the worst possible time, right after the funeral when the guests hadn't left yet. This was no coincidence.

Someone had orchestrated this.

The goal was to force him to make a decision in front of all the guests, no matter what he chose, he had to give an explanation.

But he couldn't worry about that now.

He needed to find out the truth to save Christina.

After seeing off the guests, William drove home. He needed to go to the study to sort through Nicholas's belongings.

Elisa followed him in.

She closed the door and, with tears streaming down her face, said, "William, please, you have to save Christina. She's your wife."

"I know. I won't abandon her," William reassured her.

But Elisa was still worried.

Even if Christina was saved, the Cavendish family looked at them with disdain, wishing they would just disappear.

Who knew what they would do to Christina next?

"Why don't you send her away, somewhere far? Once things calm down, bring her back. Ever since we entered the Cavendish family, they've treated us like outsiders. Gabrielle has been making my life difficult," Elisa said, still uneasy.

William couldn't be with Christina all the time.

He had to investigate the truth and manage the company.

What if someone took Christina away while he wasn't there? It would be better to send her away for good.

"I'll consider everything carefully. You're a patient. Focus on getting better. Leave Christina to me. I'll take care of her," William promised solemnly.

What he failed to do in the past life, he would do in this one.

Both Christina and their child would be safe.

Elisa finally felt reassured.

She could see that William genuinely cared about Christina and her safety.

With him around, things would be resolved perfectly.

Meanwhile, at the police station.

After being taken to the station, Christina was interrogated.

The interrogation room was a small, enclosed space with no windows and blue walls that created a sense of pressure.

The officer in charge of the interrogation was experienced.

He sat across from Christina and pointed to a slogan on the wall behind him. "See that? The law never rejects those who sincerely repent. You're still young. If you confess, your sentence can be reduced to the minimum, and the impact on you will be the smallest."

"I haven't hurt anyone. What am I confessing to?" Christina retorted.

She was innocent and intended to leave the same way.

"I know your situation. You and William have a forbidden love. It caused quite a stir online. If I were a parent, I wouldn't support you two being together either," the officer said, watching her closely for any reaction.

Christina nodded calmly. "Nicholas didn't like me."

"And on the day he died, he had you sign a prenuptial agreement. None of the Cavendish family assets are yours," the officer continued. "You've married William, but you're still treated as an outsider. Doesn't that bother you?"

Whether she was with William for love or money, being treated with such suspicion would make anyone resentful.

And resentment was a strong motive.

Christina shook her head. "No, it doesn't bother me. William and I are getting a divorce. We're ending our marriage. The Cavendish family money was never mine to begin with."

"You two just got married and now you're getting a divorce?" The officer didn't believe her.

He had been married and knew the feeling of newlywed bliss.

Even if a couple was drifting apart, it would take at least six months to a year.

"Yes, because I realized he's not as great as I thought. I don't like him anymore. I don't want any ties to him, and I don't want his money," Christina said. "I have a job. I can support myself. I don't need to scheme for someone else's money."

###chapter 194 Malicious Bullying

William had offered to spend money on her, but she didn't want it.

She was perfectly fine being self-sufficient.

The police kept grilling Christina with questions, and she answered everything truthfully, without holding anything back.

From her responses, the police couldn't find a single flaw.

There were two possibilities: either Christina was telling the truth, or she was such an expert liar that she could lie without batting an eye.

"Ms. Windsor, until we get to the bottom of this, you'll have to stay at the station. If you change your mind, come find me anytime," the officer reminded her before leaving. "Your future is in your own hands."

Christina understood the subtext.

He still suspected she was the killer and was trying to get her to confess.

If she were the killer, maybe those words would make her change her mind.

But she wasn't.

"No matter what you say or do, I won't admit to something I didn't do," Christina added, watching his back as he left.

The officer paused for a moment but didn't turn around. He left the interrogation room.

Christina thought the questioning was over.

But to her surprise, she was interrogated four times in one day.

And many of the questions were repetitive.

She had to answer them over and over again.

It wasn't until evening that she was finally allowed to rest in the holding cell.

This place was nothing like the Cavendish family mansion. There weren't even individual rooms; everyone was crammed into a large communal space.

Christina tried to adapt to the environment.

She found a corner to lie down in and quickly fell asleep.

She slept until morning when a foot kicked her several times, waking her up.

Christina groggily opened her eyes and turned to see the woman lying behind her in the dim light. "Why did you kick me?"

She slept quietly, not moving around, and stayed in her own space without bothering anyone.

But this woman had come at her first thing in the morning, clearly looking for trouble!

"You took my spot and you ask why? Have you no shame? This bed is mine, get out of here," the woman said aggressively, grabbing Christina's blanket and throwing it on the floor.

Then she moved to push her out. "Get lost, you don't deserve to sleep in my spot."

"Does it have your name on it? Or will it respond if you call it?" Christina wasn't one to start trouble.

But she wasn't afraid of it either.

There were no assigned beds in the holding cell.

If the woman had asked nicely, Christina wouldn't have minded giving up the spot. She wasn't that petty.

But!

"You threw my blanket and expect me to sleep on the floor? That's not right," Christina said coldly.

The woman sneered.

Among all the people here, she had been in the police station the longest. She used to be in a gang and was known for being tough. She had plenty of ways to make people behave.

She looked at Christina provocatively and then, right in front of her, kicked Christina's pillow to the floor.

Others had woken up but no one intervened. No one wanted to get involved, especially not for a newcomer, and risk angering the gang woman.

Except for a few of the woman's lackeys, who came over not to help Christina but to add fuel to the fire.

"When she came in last night, she just went to sleep without even saying hello or goodnight. No manners at all. And now she dares to defy you. She needs to be taught a lesson."

"Exactly, look at her. She doesn't seem like a decent person. A real piece of work."

The next second, the woman grabbed Christina's chin. "You look like you've seduced plenty of men, but let me tell you, I'm not like those filthy men who... Ah!"

Christina slapped her hand away. "Show some respect."

This action completely enraged the woman.

She was used to being the boss here, with her lackeys always flattering her. Being defied by Christina was unacceptable.

If she couldn't put Christina in her place today, how could she maintain her authority?

"Fuck you, you shameless bitch. Hold her down and strip her. Let's see if she still acts tough," the woman ordered viciously.

Her lackeys immediately complied, pinning Christina's shoulders.

Christina wasn't about to let them have their way.

She fought back desperately, trying to break free.

But how could she, alone, fight off three people?

Soon, her arms were pinned down.

The woman circled around to face her, looking down at her arrogantly. "Weren't you so tough just now? Didn't you look down on me? Let's see you act tough now!"

The woman wasn't satisfied with just words.

She reached out to grab Christina's face, but Christina quickly bit down on her finger, hard.

"Ah!"

The woman's screams grew louder and louder.

Her lackeys were startled and loosened their grip.

Christina seized the opportunity to break free. She didn't hold back, going straight for the leader.

She slapped the woman hard, the sound echoing in the room. "You want to bully me? No way! I'm not someone you can scare. If you want to mess with me, I'll fight you to the end."

She was ready for a fight, even if it meant both of them getting hurt.

Better for both of them to end up in the hospital than for her to be bullied alone.

Christina knew that reasoning wouldn't work here. The only way to deal with bullies was to fight back.

Only by being tough and making her tormentors pay would they leave her alone.

The woman's eyes flashed with malice.

Just then, footsteps approached, followed by a police officer's voice. "Settle down. You're in the police station, act like it."

"You're lucky today," the woman muttered, then moved aside with her lackeys.

When the officer arrived, he immediately noticed Christina's disheveled hair.

He also saw the three others with messed-up clothes.

He knew they'd been fighting, but without catching them in the act, he didn't bother with it. "Christina, come with me. We're going to ask you some questions."

###chapter 195 Released from Prison

Before Christina stepped out, she turned around to remind the women behind her.

"Behave yourselves. Don't forget where you are."

The women, who had been so fierce during the fight with Christina, now gave awkward smiles.

"Yeah, we got it. Don't worry."

As Christina was led out, she noticed the puzzled look on the officer's face.

She had just been brought in, so who could possibly be here to see her?

When she reached the visiting area, she saw someone unexpected through the glass.

She couldn't believe William had come. The officer coldly informed her that she had 20 minutes for the visit.

His voice carried over to William, essentially telling them to make the most of their time.

After saying this, the officer left the room.

William picked up the phone, and when he saw Christina's disheveled appearance through the glass, his heart ached.

Christina noticed William's gaze and turned her head away, not picking up the phone.

William gestured to the phone.

Christina sighed and finally picked up the receiver.

"What are you doing here?"

Christina hadn't forgotten everything that had happened, so William's appearance wasn't exactly welcome news.

Even though William had defended her immediately after the incident, it didn't matter now that she was here.

Besides, Christina firmly believed in her innocence.

She had just had an unpleasant encounter.

"What happened to you? You're only being held as a suspect. Did someone hurt you?"

He saw her messy hair and wrinkled clothes, and his brow furrowed with concern.

"I'm fine. Just a minor incident. But why are you here?"

Despite William's efforts to stop it, she had still been taken away.

So Christina didn't understand what William was trying to do.

Especially considering the events of the past, she didn't trust his intentions.

William sighed, his concern unwavering, and said helplessly.

"I was blocked from getting to you, and I was also dealing with Nicholas's funeral. But don't worry, I'm here to tell you that I'll get you out."

"Why would you want to help me?"

William's attitude had been consistent for a long time.

Although Christina wasn't moved by it, his response still made her pause.

"You're my wife. I owe you that much. And I believe you're not the kind of person they're saying you are."

His tone was firm. While others might think Christina had motives, he knew her stubborn nature. Once she made up her mind, she wouldn't change it, let alone harm Nicholas for money.

"So, should I thank you for your trust?"

To be honest, the whole situation had happened so suddenly.

She hadn't had time to prepare, and she didn't remember much about what happened with Nicholas.

"Even if you don't say anything, I'll investigate. I've already made arrangements. You won't stay in here."

William finished speaking and prepared to hang up and leave.

Christina felt a bit panicked, an unrealistic thought crossing her mind.

But thinking it over, she doubted William would go that far.

"What are you gonna do?"

Before she could say more, William had already left.

The officer took Christina back to the room.

The earlier incident had made the other women wary of Christina.

They hadn't expected her to fight so fiercely.

But Christina didn't care about their expressions. She was thinking about what William had said.

"How'd you end up in here?"

One of the women tried to talk to Christina, but she just rolled her eyes.

She didn't want to associate with them. In a small prison, they were still trying to bully others.

They were already at the bottom, yet they still clung to such delusions.

"None of your business."

Christina's words left them speechless.

The gang leader woman sat with her legs crossed, full of disdain.

"Why are you even asking? She can't be a good person if she's in here with us."

"But let me remind you, since you're here with me, you'd better behave. Don't cause trouble, or what happened earlier will seem like a joke."

Christina sneered, looking at the woman in front of her.

"Do you think I'm afraid of you? Or any of you?"

She scanned the room.

In Christina's mind, she had already died once.

There was nothing left to fear. These women talked tough, but when it came to fighting, they were scared.

Christina turned her head away, not giving them a chance to speak.

Nearly two hours passed.

Just as the women were about to start trouble again, the officer returned.

This time, his look at Christina was complicated.

Christina was puzzled but looked up at him.

"Change your clothes. Someone posted your bail. But you're still a suspect. You can't leave the country or go anywhere else. Until the investigation is complete, you could be brought back at any time."

The officer's words shocked everyone in the room.

Christina had been there less than five hours, and she was already getting out?

Given the officer's earlier demeanor, it didn't seem likely she would be released so soon.

The woman who had led the attack on Christina now looked at her strangely.

"Who posted my bail?"

Christina had a guess but asked anyway.

Since she was getting out, the officer wasn't as cold as before.

"Isn't it your husband? That's what I was told. You'll be on standby at home. Once you're cleared, you'll be free."

After saying this, Christina was taken out.

As she walked out of the police station, she saw William approaching.

"Why are you doing this?"

Though she was glad to be out, Christina didn't understand William's motives.

Letting her out before the facts were clear seemed pointless. She might as well stay inside.

"I told you, I believe you. I'll find out the truth and clear your name. You don't need to worry about anything else."

William pulled Christina over and put her in the car.

"How do you plan to explain this to the Cavendish family?"

When Nicholas had his accident, the Cavendish family had been cold and uncooperative. Even though Christina was distant with William, the family had also doubted him.

###chapter 196 Sent Abroad

"Don't sweat it. Just head out of the country for a bit. I'll get to the bottom of this and bring you back."

Christina looked at William, confused.

It was only then that she realized the car wasn't heading back to their home or the Cavendish Mansion. Instead, it was heading straight for the airport.

"What are you doing? Are you nuts?"

"The cops said I should stay in the country and not leave. This counts as fleeing to avoid punishment."

Christina glared at William, clearly upset.

But William kept his eyes on the road, his gaze cold but determined.

"I believe you didn't kill anyone, unless you actually did."

Christina's anger deflated a bit at his words.

"I really didn't kill anyone, but this isn't necessary. Your situation is tough enough." Christina hesitated for a long time before finally speaking.

The car stopped at a red light, and William turned to look at Christina.

"Are you worried about me?"

Christina turned to look out the window, choosing not to respond.

William smiled faintly at her expression, then the light turned green, and he continued driving.

"I know you don't want to be around me, but avoiding me and finding the truth are two different things. I won't let you suffer this injustice. Trust me."

They didn't speak for the rest of the drive.

Christina kept thinking of ways to change William's mind. If she really went abroad, the rumors would only get worse before the truth came out. The internet was already full of mixed opinions about the case.

Some people even said Christina was the one who did it, and that human nature was terrifying.

Although Christina didn't want to be around William, she did want to clear her name.

So she thought about asking William to contact a lawyer or someone she knew.

She didn't expect him to make such a decisive move.

By the time Christina snapped out of her thoughts, they were already at the airport.

William took her through the VIP passage and directly onto a private jet.

Christina tried to get off, but William firmly stopped her.

"Please trust me. Coming back now won't do you any good. I don't want you to get hurt. I'll find out the truth and come get you."

With that, William pulled Christina into a hug and gently patted her back.

As Christina looked up, he kissed her forehead.

He then buckled her seatbelt and got off the plane.

Watching William's back as he left, Christina moved her lips.

"No, I need to get off."

She was still determined.

But the crew looked a bit awkward.

"Ms. Windsor, please don't make this difficult for us. We heard about the situation, and we believe you."

Hearing this, Christina smiled faintly and finally sat back down, feeling anxious.

After several hours, the plane landed in Zephyra.

Looking at the unfamiliar country, Christina frowned deeply.

She thought she'd be free once she got here.

But as soon as she got off the plane, a middle-aged butler approached her with a smile.

"Hello, are you Ms. Christina Windsor?"

Although he had a photo of Christina and everything was confirmed, he still maintained his manners.

Christina, though puzzled, nodded at him.

"I'm the butler Mr. Cavendish arranged to take care of you here. Please follow me."

The butler led the way.

Christina hesitated but eventually followed him.

She got into a private car outside the airport.

After about 40 minutes, the car stopped in front of a villa.

"Ms. Windsor, please get out."

The butler kindly opened the car door for Christina.

Looking at the unfamiliar surroundings, Christina frowned.

"How long do I have to stay here?"

She was worried William might do something excessive.

The butler hesitated.

"I'm not sure. Mr. Cavendish just told me to take care of you here. As long as everything is fine, you can go back."

In other words, she needed William's permission to leave.

Christina had no choice but to stay for now.

But every day she stayed, she felt anxious. Although she wanted to keep up with the situation back home, the butler made sure she only saw the news and nothing else to avoid making her more anxious.

Meanwhile, the Cavendish family was furious with William's actions.

"What are you doing?"

"You're protecting a criminal! I know you love your wife, but Nicholas can't die in vain."

The elders of the Cavendish family expressed their dissatisfaction with William's actions during a meeting.

"If you don't give an explanation, this won't be easy to resolve."

William looked at them coldly. After Christina left, he intensified his investigation.

And what he found was shocking.

"You elders are really something. Do you not know why this happened?"

He rarely spoke to them this way.

After all, they were his elders, and he had some respect for them.

But what he found made it impossible to stay calm.

"What do you mean? Do you think we wronged Christina?"

The elders were confused by William's behavior.

"We'll know if she's innocent once the truth comes out. Before that, you shouldn't have done this. Do you think the company's shares are too high?"

"Or do you have so much profit that you can't spend it all?"

His words made the elders' faces darken.

They had only wanted to deal with Christina to distract William, making it easier for them to do what they wanted.

But William's words hit the mark.

Now, the outside world was full of rumors about the Cavendish Corporation.

The company's shares had dropped significantly.

Nicholas's friends kept calling to ask what was going on.

The family was in turmoil.

"We just used the most appropriate method. If you believe Christina is innocent, she should stay in the police station."

"Once the authorities find out the truth, they'll release her. Sending her abroad like this, do you know what that means?"

They thought William was too impulsive and didn't consider everyone's opinions.

William sneered.

"You never treated me like family. This isn't your place to speak. You know how you treated Grandpa. Don't pretend to care now."

With that, William turned and left.

He wouldn't give the Cavendish family any more leverage. They spoke lightly about keeping Christina in the police station, but he couldn't bear to see her despair again.

He'd rather be criticized than let Christina suffer.

###chapter 197  Find a Way to Return

"Dax, how's Christina holding up?"

After getting everything sorted, William called Dax, the butler who was taking care of Christina, from home.

"Ms. Windsor's alright, but she's in a pretty bad mood. She keeps saying she wants to come back."

The butler gave William a detailed update on Christina's situation.

William rubbed his temples, feeling the stress.

He knew Christina was headstrong and wanted to confront everyone before the truth came out.

But wouldn't that just make her look guilty?

He didn't want Christina to go through that kind of humiliation.

"Okay, I get it. Keep an eye on her. Once I wrap things up here, I'll make sure you get a bonus."

After giving a few more instructions, William hung up the phone.

Christina was still staring out the window.

For the past few days, she had barely moved, except to eat and sleep, constantly thinking of ways to leave.

At first, Christina thought she could escape once she got her documents.

Or she could sneak out when the butler wasn't paying attention.

But despite his age, the butler was sharp.

None of Christina's little tricks escaped his notice.

"Ms. Windsor, don't waste your energy. Staying here isn't so bad. I know you want to clear your name, but going back now would be walking into a trap."

"Mr. Cavendish is already investigating. Don't rush things."

The butler tried to persuade her earnestly.

But Christina wouldn't listen.

"If you keep causing trouble like before, I'll have to get some bodyguards to watch you," the butler said firmly.

Hearing this, Christina had to temporarily give up her plans.

But she kept scheming in her mind.

How could she leave this place?

Christina knew the butler was telling the truth. Although she was staying here, she wasn't being mistreated.

She had the best food and drink, and she overheard the butler's call with William.

Christina was curious about the progress of the investigation.

But she couldn't stand the rumors online.

If people knew she had fled abroad without clearing her name, it would only worsen their judgment of her.

She couldn't accept that.

"I'm not running, but can you give me some electronic devices? If not, I'll keep causing trouble."

The butler, worn out by Christina, finally called William to ask for permission to give her a phone.

But Christina didn't have a local number, so she couldn't contact anyone back home.

After all this, Christina had been abroad for several days.

Though her life here seemed pleasant, she was constantly anxious.

Her anxiety worsened her morning sickness.

She had suffered a lot to keep this baby, but Christina didn't want to let things go.

William was equally worried. He was concerned about Christina's health and the baby.

Whenever he had time, he would call the butler to check on Christina.

It seemed to be the only way to ease his mind.

On the seventh day abroad, Christina couldn't take it anymore.

She asked the butler to buy ice cream from the countryside, a plan she had prepared in advance.

Once he left, Christina used a candle from a dinner to set the curtains on fire.

When the butler returned, he was shocked by the blaze.

He called for help to put out the fire while searching for Christina.

Christina had planned to use the fire as a distraction to slip past her guards and escape.

After days of careful observation, she had pinpointed where her documents were kept.

Now was her chance.

But she didn't anticipate the fire spreading so quickly. By the time the butler returned, Christina had already collapsed from the smoke.

The butler rushed her to the hospital and immediately called William.

William was terrified by the news.

Why was she in such a hurry? Couldn't she wait a little longer, give him more time?

He knew Christina was stubborn, but now he felt utterly helpless.

He couldn't leave the country until the matter was resolved, so he had to rely on the butler.

"Take good care of Christina. Don't restrict her movements for now. Call me if anything happens."

"What do you mean?" The butler was puzzled.

William sighed.

"If she wants to leave, just follow her and make sure she's safe. Don't interfere otherwise."

The butler was surprised but followed William's instructions.

Since Christina left, William had intensified his investigation.

He looked into the company's internal affairs and the recent actions of his family elders.

He had to find out the cause of Nicholas's death. Initially, he believed Christina was innocent.

He wanted to have a forensic examination.

The cause of Nicholas's death would be clear from an autopsy.

But the family elders wouldn't allow it.

Nicholas had always cared about his appearance.

They believed he deserved peace in death, not further disturbance.

William thought an autopsy was the best way to prove Christina's innocence.

But the elders' words were also true.

Nicholas had been strict about maintaining his appearance, even in death.

If William went through with it, it might truly upset Nicholas.

In the end, William had to find another way.

This made the investigation harder, but he wouldn't miss any opportunity, even if it meant sleepless nights.

"Yes, follow this lead. See what my uncle Gage has been up to."

He thoroughly investigated the Cavendish family elders.

When they found out, they were terrified.

One elder confronted William.

"Why are you doing this? Do you think we could be behind this?"

The elder feared William would uncover their dirty secrets.

So he tried to persuade William to give up.

"It's not that complicated. Have Christina come back and confess. We'll write a letter of forgiveness, and she can get out sooner."

"You're wasting time and energy, neglecting the company. Why bother?"

William sneered at the elder's words.

"If you haven't done anything wrong, you have nothing to fear. Besides, she didn't kill anyone. Why should she confess?"

"Is it to cover up someone else's crime?"

He had once respected these elders, but now their actions disgusted him.

"As an elder, I'm just advising you not to waste time on this. If you insist, I can't help you."

Seeing he couldn't persuade William, the elder left in a huff, informing the others.

They had always covered for each other. If the investigation into Nicholas's death exposed other issues, it would be bad.

Despite their attempts to dissuade him, William refused to give up.

###chapter 198 Clearing Injustice

This made them a bit uneasy.

"Look, if you guys don't have anything to hide, then you should be fine with an investigation. Stop throwing excuses at me every time I try to dig into this."

After discussing company matters, William kept the family members behind in the meeting room.

Everyone's faces turned grim upon hearing this.

"How can you talk like that?"

"We just think this has a huge impact. We're all family, and you keep investigating like you don't care about anyone else."

"Exactly, isn't this a bit much?"

No matter what they said, they refused to admit they were obstructing William's investigation.

"Really? Then why didn't you consider the impact when you sent Christina to the police?"

"Isn't Christina part of our family?"

His brows furrowed, and his voice turned icy. The others' faces darkened even more.

They had long noticed that William had a special concern for Christina.

Now, hearing his words, their expressions grew even more unpleasant.

"You can't say that. If Christina made a mistake, she should be held accountable. If she's truly innocent, the authorities will clear her name, unlike the current situation."

He implied that William was meddling unnecessarily.

This completely infuriated William.

He slammed the documents on the table with a loud 'bang.'

"Don't you think your words are contradictory?"

"You're afraid of me uncovering your deeds and exposing you."

His words made the atmosphere extremely awkward.

"That's not what Gage meant. If you want to investigate, go ahead. But if you can't get to the bottom of it and make a mess, you might as well step down."

Another elder, growing impatient, said this and was the first to leave the office.

The others sighed and left one by one.

After they left, William received a call from his assistant.

"We have a lead."

"I can't explain over the phone. You need to come here."

William went to the forensic lab.

Investigating this matter required delving into every aspect.

He not only had to look into the recent activities of the elders but also the items Nicholas used before his death.

Almost everything that could be tested was sent for analysis.

Although most things were fine, William didn't overlook any detail.

He actually found a clue in some discarded items.

"There are indeed traces of poison here. Nicholas wasn't in good health and often took medicine, right?"

"If this medicine is taken alone, it's fine. But combined with what Nicholas was drinking, it becomes toxic."

"Over time, anyone's body would fail."

"What do you mean?"

The forensic expert's words made William's brows knit together.

He had suspected someone was framing Christina, but he hadn't expected it to be the result of long-term poisoning.

"It means the dosage of this medicine was increased. To those who don't understand medicine, it seemed like Nicholas's condition worsened, necessitating this."

"But in reality, this medicine shouldn't have been in Nicholas's regimen."

After hearing the explanation, William's frown deepened.

"Alright, I get it."

He pocketed the evidence and left with his assistant.

On the way back, his brows stayed furrowed.

Just then, his phone rang. It was the butler.

"Mr. Cavendish, Ms. Windsor is fine. She's settled in the hospital, and the baby is safe."

William let out a sigh of relief.

"Good. Keep an eye on things and let me know if anything changes."

He hung up, his gaze hardening.

"If you want this position so badly, then come and try."

His assistant was taken aback by William's determination.

Although William had always been unapproachable, he softened whenever Christina was mentioned. But since her incident, he hadn't shown any warmth.

Only when receiving calls about Christina did his tone soften slightly.

"What did you say?"

Gage, receiving a call from his subordinate, was shocked.

"How is this possible? Didn't I tell you to handle it cleanly? How could there be such a loose end?"

His subordinate was extremely embarrassed.

"We did handle it, but we don't know what Nicholas told Christina in the end, so we didn't have time to clean up the last traces."

Before he could finish speaking, William barged in with his team.

"I didn't know you had such intentions. What did Nicholas ever do to you?"

William's gaze was piercing. Gage hung up the phone.

He sat in a chair, looking down at William.

"You're just a junior. What gives you the right to talk to me like this?"

William threw the copied documents on the table.

"Do I need to repeat myself?"

Gage glanced at the documents, understanding the situation.

"So you suspect me?"

William let out a cold laugh.

"Do I need to check the surveillance?"

"Will you turn yourself in, or should I expose everyone involved?"

They were all part of the Cavendish family. If the public knew about their infighting and the involvement of innocent people, the family's stock would surely plummet. William was betting on Gage's choice.

They stared each other down for a long time.

Gage's expression was grim. He hadn't expected William to grow so formidable.

Previously, William's personality was difficult, but not as fierce as now.

After a moment, Gage spoke more gently, "Leave me alone for a bit to think."

But William stood his ground, showing no intention of backing down.

Meanwhile, the other elders of the Cavendish family received the news.

They hadn't expected William to uncover the truth so quickly.

They had hoped to cover up their tracks during his investigation, but now it was too late.

"If I leave, you'll find a way to destroy the evidence? Do you think I'll give you that chance?"

Gage, cornered by William, was at a loss for words. His expression turned even more unpleasant.

"William, we're all family. There's no need to make things so ugly. Besides, Nicholas is already dead. Even if you do this, he won't come back."

William laughed as if hearing a joke.

"Sure, the dead can't come back. But the living still have to go on."

###chapter 199  Gaining Freedom

"Is the person who was wrongfully accused still going to be a suspect?"

Gage shivered at the sound of William's cold laugh.

"You can't just ditch your own family for an outsider, can you? You and Christina just got married, but we share the same blood."

William's intense gaze made Gage's voice waver, but he felt justified once he finished speaking.

"Christina's just an outsider. You can't turn on your own family for her."

William was stunned by Gage's shamelessness.

He had thought that coming to Gage with the truth would make him realize his mistakes. But now, it was clear that Gage was not only unrepentant but also brazenly shameless.

"So, you're saying I shouldn't stand by the truth, but by you instead?"

Gage, emboldened, responded, "What else? When the truth wasn't clear, you stood by Christina unconditionally. Why can't you believe me now?"

William couldn't be bothered with his nonsense and got up to leave. But before he left, he threw out one last remark.

"If you're so confident, Gage, then wait for the authorities to come and talk to you."

After leaving, he went to find the other elders of the Cavendish family. He had only found evidence against Gage, but he was sure the others were not clean either. So, he went to extract information from them, and they never suspected that William had only uncovered part of the truth. The evidence against Gage was solid, so one by one, they fell into his trap.

William recorded all the information he gathered and then left with his assistant. However, the internet was still buzzing with accusations against Christina for murder. He hadn't been online recently, not wanting to see the distressing news. But now, with solid evidence, he could finally clear Christina's name.

He logged into his social media account and directly addressed the most vocal critics, posting the truth he had uncovered. The elders of the Cavendish family were furious when they saw it.

"So, he didn't actually investigate; he just came to trick us into talking?"

"You all are unbelievably stupid!"

The remaining information William had not released was now leverage against them. This investigation, and Nicholas's death, had provided William with some advantages. Although no one had dared to oppose him in the company before, now, with this leverage, neither in the company nor at home could the elders defy him.

"Oh my God, is this for real?"

"So it was a family feud? Poor Christina!"

"Yeah, and she's pregnant too. What a terrible situation."

"No wonder William didn't respond earlier. He was gathering evidence. He really cares about Christina."

"Of course, they're married. He wouldn't just stop believing in his partner over something like this."

Reading these comments online, William felt a warmth in his heart.

Meanwhile, Christina, who had woken up in the hospital, was eager to know what was happening back home. But strangely, the butler who should have been by her side was nowhere to be found. Curious, Christina accepted the phone the butler brought her.

"Sorry, Ms. Windsor. Mr. Cavendish said if you really want to regain your freedom, you should discuss it with him and not jeopardize your health."

The butler, though instructed to stay hidden, felt this needed to be explained.

"What happened?"

Christina had been unconscious for two days due to smoke inhalation. In that time, William had cleared her name.

"You can check the situation online."

The butler handed her a phone connected to the internet. Christina immediately looked up what people were saying about her. She was prepared for the worst but was shocked to find that all the negative comments had disappeared, replaced by sympathetic ones.

This left Christina puzzled. Following the trail of comments about a loving husband, she found William's social media account. Seeing what he had posted, she was stunned.

So, it was a family feud, and she had been caught in the crossfire. Although she didn't want to believe it, she was now exonerated. The authorities had also informed her that she was no longer a suspect and that the real culprit had been apprehended.

Christina was confused. Wouldn't this bring negative attention to the company? Wasn't he worried about the stock prices dropping?

Thinking this, she checked the stock market and was shocked by what she found. Instead of dropping, the stocks had risen due to William's decisive actions and clear separation of personal and professional matters, even attracting new partnerships.

Just then, her phone showed an incoming call from William. She hesitated for a long time before answering.

"How are you? Are you okay?"

William's voice was full of concern. Christina felt she should say something sharp, but she couldn't bring herself to do it.

"Thank you for proving my innocence."

After a long pause, Christina finally said.

"We don't need to thank each other. How are you feeling? Do you want to come back now? I can come to get you."

William's voice remained humble. Christina looked around the unfamiliar hospital room and shook her head silently.

"I won't come back just yet. I need some time to relax and take care of some other things."

Christina knew that returning now would mean facing a chaotic situation. She decided to take this opportunity to relax and unwind.

"Alright, I support your decision. If you need anything, you can always contact the butler. He has connections there and can help you."

William tried to ensure everything was arranged for her. Christina didn't respond to his offer. They fell into silence.

"Well, if there's nothing else, I'll hang up now."

Christina hung up before he could say anything more. On the other end, William stared at the screen, finally relaxing. He had been on edge for days, barely sleeping, constantly investigating. Now that the truth was out, he could finally rest.

After this incident, William's authority and status in the Cavendish family soared. Even the previously arrogant elders now showed him respect.

###chapter 200 Being Embarrassed

After Christina hung up the phone, she lay in bed for a while longer, making sure everything was fine before discharging herself from the hospital.

The butler had kept his word and didn't follow her around like before. As she walked out of the hospital, Christina felt completely relaxed. Even though she had the butler shadowing her before, she had still felt a sense of freedom, but it was self-imposed restraint. Now, with both her body and mind free, the air felt different.

Since the house William had arranged for her was burned down by Christina, and the butler hadn't contacted her, she didn't plan on going back there. So, she found a nearby hotel to stay in temporarily.

In her haste, Christina bumped into someone. "Oh, sorry!" she quickly apologized, instinctively protecting her stomach.

"It's okay," a gentle voice responded. Christina looked up and saw the man staring at her with a shocked expression. She didn't understand why he looked that way, but she politely smiled at him and then walked away.

What Christina didn't know was that after she left, the man just stood there, staring at her back, lost in thought.

Back at the hotel, Christina was unpacking when her phone rang. She picked it up and saw it was a notification about a fashion show. She opened it and realized it was the collaborative fashion design exhibition she had wanted to attend. Excited, Christina quickly went to the official website to make a reservation. But since it was late, she couldn't get an online invitation. Christina decided to try her luck in person.

When she arrived at the hotel hosting the event, she was immediately met with hostility. "A designer from Valoria? Never heard of you. Are you sure you're in the right place?" The staff member looked Christina up and down with disdain after learning her purpose.

Meanwhile, another local designer arrived. Although not famous, the staff treated them with respect. "Right this way, please. Once you get your invitation, you can get it stamped over there and then go in."

Hearing the staff's polite tone, Christina was annoyed. "Excuse me, whether I'm famous or not, I followed the proper procedure. Isn't this a bit inappropriate?"

The staff member sneered. "Inappropriate? If you want to attend our show, you need to follow our rules. This isn't Valoria, and you don't make the rules here."

As the staff member finished speaking, others joined in mocking her. "Exactly." "If you're on our turf, you should follow our rules."

Christina's face darkened. She was about to take out her credentials and comply when a woman approached. "Jessica, long time no see. You're looking more beautiful than ever."

The woman didn't follow any procedures but instead chatted with the staff. Christina was pushed aside. The staff's attitude towards the woman was completely different from how they treated Christina.

"It's been a while. Are you here for an invitation? Let me help you out," the woman said, cutting in line again.

Christina held back her anger and waited until the process was done before finally getting her invitation. As she left, she received dirty looks from the staff.

"People who don't understand the rules will always face the same treatment, no matter how many times they come," one of them sneered.

Christina ignored their comments. To make it easier to attend the show, she checked out of her hotel and booked a room near the exhibition.

The day of the show arrived quickly. Not wanting to be late, Christina planned to arrive early to familiarize herself with the venue. She wasn't just there for her passion; she hoped to find inspiration for her future designs.

At the entrance, she saw the same woman again. Christina wasn't sure if the woman was from Valoria and didn't plan to greet her. But as she walked past, the woman blocked her path.

"I remember you. You were the one having trouble with the staff the other day," the woman said.

Christina looked at her, puzzled. She didn't know what the woman wanted, so she calmly met her gaze.

"I don't mean any harm. I just want to remind you that this isn't the place for you. The standards here are high. If I were you, I'd leave the invitation and go," the woman said, glancing mockingly at Christina's pregnant belly.

"Why should I listen to you?" Christina asked, frowning.

"Since you're pregnant, you should be preparing for your baby, not taking someone else's spot. If you give up your spot, it would create opportunities for others who want to shine here," the woman replied.

Christina found this laughable. "I'm here for my passion. Just because I'm pregnant, does that mean I can't pursue my dreams? We're both women, and you can say something like that? It's just funny."

Leaving the woman behind, Christina handed her invitation to the doorman. She lifted her dress and walked in.

Inside, she encountered the woman again, now with a group of people. They looked at Christina with disdain. Christina didn't understand why they looked at her that way but didn't bother with them.

When she tried to find someone to introduce the exhibition, she was ignored. Just as Christina was considering her options, the group approached her again. But before they could speak, a tall figure stood in front of Christina.

"I wasn't aware of such rules here," a gentle voice interrupted them.

"Why are you helping her, Duke?" one of them asked.

Hearing them address the man as Duke, Christina looked at him. When she saw his face, she remembered where she had seen him before. He smiled warmly at Christina before turning a cold gaze to the others.

"I believe art knows no borders. Ms. Christina Windsor is a special guest of the organizers. What are your credentials?" His voice was cold, and Christina found his words puzzling.

The group's faces turned sour. "How is that possible?" one of them muttered.

"Why not?" And just then, it was time for the exhibition to start.

###chapter 201 You Can't Leave

Christina was having a great time at the art exhibit.

But just as she was about to leave, someone blocked her path.

It was Rhea, the woman who had a thing for Walter.

Rhea stood in her way, her eyes filled with malice.

Christina glanced at her, "What do you want?"

"I just don't get it. What is it about you that makes Walter so obsessed? All my efforts, and I look like a fool to him," Rhea said, stepping closer and touching Christina's face. "Is it because of this face?"

Christina took a step back, feeling a chill run down her spine as she looked at Rhea's crazed expression. "Rhea, get a grip. No one falls deeply in love just because of someone's looks. If you give your heart, you'll get the same in return."

Rhea snapped, "Bullshit! I've tried so hard, and it didn't work. But you, you get it so easily." She moved closer, "Your face is perfect. Even if I weren't a man, I'd like you. Christina, it's a gift from above."

Christina thought she was losing it. "I don't have time for this. I need to go."

Rhea grabbed her wrist. "Go? You're not going anywhere!"

"What?" Christina hadn't even processed what was happening when a crowd gathered around her. "What are you doing? Are you crazy?" Christina couldn't believe that Rhea, who once promised to help her win Walter's heart, would attack her now that she was alone in a foreign country.

Christina's heart raced as she looked around, realizing there was no escape.

Rhea's eyes sparkled with madness. "What are you waiting for? Take her away."

Christina tried to reason with her, but Rhea stuffed a scarf into her mouth, silencing her.

Surrounded by the crowd, Christina struggled, her eyes filled with terror. "Take her away," Rhea ordered again, her voice cold and firm.

Christina was forced into a car, which sped off into the snowy wilderness.

Outside the window, the snow-covered landscape stretched endlessly. Christina's heart sank. She had no idea where Rhea was taking her or if she'd ever get the chance to return.

The car bumped along a winding mountain road, and Christina's heart rose and fell with each turn.

After what felt like forever, the car finally stopped. Christina was pulled out, shivering as a cold wind hit her.

She looked around and saw an old mansion at the end of the road, hidden among the trees, looking eerie and foreboding.

"What do you want?" Christina didn't want to go inside.

"I suggest you cooperate, or I'll kill you. No one will find you here," Rhea threatened through gritted teeth.

Seeing the desolate surroundings, Christina knew Rhea wasn't bluffing.

This was likely a private estate, and even if she escaped, there was no one around for miles.

Rhea seemed determined to deal with her this time.

Before she could think further, Christina was dragged into the mansion.

It was dark and abandoned, filled with the scent of decay.

Time seemed to stand still here, everything frozen in a past era.

At first, Rhea would visit her, talking about Walter.

But gradually, Rhea's visits became less frequent and more mysterious.

"You know, I checked the news back home. No one seems to care if you're dead or alive," Rhea said one day.

Christina gave a bitter smile.

Since Nicholas's death, she had become a taboo subject, unmentioned by anyone.

Locked away here, seeing no one, she was on the brink of madness.

"Why don't you just kill me?"

"I can't bear to kill you. If I did, I'd have no way out. But soon, I'll succeed!" Rhea's sharp laughter echoed through the mansion.

Christina covered her ears.

Walter had been searching for Christina in the city for a long time.

In the vast snowy landscape, it was as if she had vanished into thin air.

He was disoriented, pulling his coat tighter around him.

As he turned to leave, he bumped into a woman.

"Sorry!" he coughed.

"It's okay," the woman replied, her voice low.

He looked up and his eyes widened.

"Christina."

The woman in front of him was Christina.

Her brows, her eyes, her lips-she looked exactly like the Christina he had been longing for.

He couldn't help but pull her into a tight embrace. "You've been abroad for so long. Do you know how long I've been looking for you?"

"Sorry, I didn't mean to hide," Christina said, lowering her head, guilt flashing in her eyes.

"It's okay. As long as you're here, I'm happy," Walter said, holding her even tighter, as if she were a precious treasure he had found again.

Christina's hand lifted slightly, as if to return the hug, but then she pulled back.

"Walter..."

Walter realized and let go, "Sorry, I was just so excited to see you. I've been looking for you for over a month. It was like you disappeared."

"It's nothing. I just didn't want to be found," Christina said, lowering her eyes.

Walter frowned, sensing something off in her words. A feeling of unease rose in him.

"What's wrong? Your voice sounds different."

Christina hesitated, then smiled, "The air here is so dry and cold. Even after all this time, I can't get used to it. Maybe it's a sore throat."

"Christina, I know you can't accept me, but please, don't hide from me," Walter pleaded.

A flash of hatred crossed Christina's eyes.

After a long pause, she nodded.

"I know you're doing this for my sake. I shouldn't have hidden."

Walter nodded, "Let's start over here."

Christina's heart stirred, and she nodded, "Okay."

She told him the hotel and room number where she was staying.

Walter, trusting her completely, moved to the same hotel, right next to her room.

The next morning, Christina heard a knock on her door. When she opened it, she saw a bouquet of vibrant roses.

In the cold weather, with the nearest flower shop far away, he must have kept them hidden in his coat, protecting the delicate petals all the way back.

###chapter 202  Do You Like It?

"Do you like it?" Walter's face peeked out from behind the slowly lowering bouquet of roses.

Christina's eyes lit up as she took the bouquet. "They smell amazing! I love them!"

"Glad to hear it. Your windowsill could use a little color. Let me find a vase," Walter offered.

Christina stepped aside to let him in.

Though a bit unsure, Walter walked in confidently, found a vase, and arranged the flowers on the windowsill.

The petals unfurled beautifully, blooming perfectly.

"Are you hungry? Let's grab some breakfast. This place has an awesome dark chocolate cake," Walter suggested.

"I checked it out before you came. It's really good," Christina agreed.

At the restaurant, they ordered two slices of dark chocolate cake and a cup of hot milk.

Walter glanced at her. "So, what's next for you?"

"Just taking it one step at a time. Staying here for now seems nice, don't you think?" Christina took a deep breath. "The streets smell like fresh bread, and even though it's cold, the snowy scenery is lovely."

"Really? I thought after everything that happened, you wouldn't want to stay abroad," Walter said with a faint smile.

"Times change." Christina looked up at him. "Would you stay abroad for me?"

Walter was taken aback, staring at her for a long moment before asking, "In what way?"

"What do you want to be?" Christina tilted her head, smiling as if coaxing him.

Walter swallowed, his face full of anticipation. "Boyfriend? Husband?"

Christina burst out laughing. "No matter what, you're my brother. Here, we can rely on each other."

Walter felt a bit disappointed but understood it was reasonable.

Christina had always seen him that way.

Just then, the cake arrived.

Christina took a bite, her expression changing instantly.

"Is your pastry chef Charlie here today?"

The waiter quickly explained, "Charlie is off today. Another pastry chef, Tina, made the cake."

"I thought so. The taste is off," Christina put down her fork and wiped her lips. "A change in chef, a change in taste. It ruins the mood."

The waiter's face changed, and he quickly apologized. "I'm very sorry for not informing you beforehand. How about this, when Charlie returns, we'll give you another dark chocolate cake on the house."

"Do I look like I need a free cake?" Christina frowned, tapping her fingers lightly on the table.

Her behavior was quite disrespectful.

Walter was also taken aback.

"Christina, you're not usually this particular. What's going on today?"

Christina suddenly realized and smiled apologetically. "Sorry, I might be in a bad mood because of a cold. My favorite cake didn't taste right, so I snapped."

Walter's suspicious look softened.

"It's okay. No matter what, I'm here with you. You don't need to be so tense. Let's try something else."

He turned to the waiter. "What else is the new pastry chef good at?"

"Her lava cake is pretty popular," the waiter suggested.

"Alright, let's go with that," Walter decided.

Christina sighed, "Thank goodness for your patience. Lately, my mood... never mind."

"If you're feeling down, how about we go for a walk?" Walter suggested.

Christina's eyes lit up. "Go out? Sure!"

Walter looked at her excited face, feeling something was off.

It wasn't that he disliked the current Christina, but she was very different from before.

She used to never fuss over small things or get excited over such matters. She always kept a distance, a deep divide between them.

The snowy scenery of Zephyra was indeed extraordinary.

Inside the grand art gallery, artists from various countries were creating ice sculptures. Their carving tools moved like magic in their hands.

Christina, however, seemed uninterested.

Walter bought her a hot drink. "I forgot you have a sore throat. Maybe it's not the best idea to be out in the cold. Let's head back soon."

"Sorry for ruining your fun," Christina seemed to realize something.

Walter smiled and shook his head. "It's nothing."

Back at the hotel, he skipped dinner and went straight to his room.

The night fell early, a thin layer of frost covered the window, and the outside lights blurred into a haze through the frosted glass.

For some reason, ever since meeting Christina again, he felt something was off. It was as if she had become someone he didn't recognize, yet he couldn't pinpoint what was wrong. Her face was the same, her actions were the same.

But his instincts told him something was amiss.

As he pondered, there was a sudden knock on the door.

He got up and asked, "Who's there?"

"It's me, Christina."

Walter opened the door.

Christina stood outside, holding a bottle of red wine.

"I can't sleep and I haven't eaten. Can we talk? Do you have time?"

"Of course," Walter stepped aside. "I'm here to keep you company. You can come to me anytime."

"Good." Christina smiled warmly, pulling out a chair and pouring them each a glass of wine.

"I love sitting by the window, watching the night and sipping wine. You should try it."

Walter quickly joined her, but his doubts only grew stronger.

"Christina, I still feel like this isn't real."

"What?" Christina looked up, puzzled.

"You're so gentle..." Walter hesitated. "You being like this makes me feel like I'm dreaming."

"Isn't this good?" Christina tilted her head, a sly smile on her face.

Walter shook his head.

"It's not that it's bad, it's just..."

"Just what?" Christina sipped her wine, a glint in her eyes.

Walter decided to speak up. "It just doesn't feel like you."

Christina laughed. "Maybe. After everything, I just want to enjoy the moment and see clearly who truly cares for me."

###chapter 203 Don't Be So Anxious

Walter couldn't believe his ears.

The woman he had chased for so many years was finally willing to get close to him?

He couldn't help but stand up and walk towards Christina, gently lifting her chin.

"I've liked you for so long and never got a response. So, are you finally gonna respond to my feelings now?"

Christina's eyes sparkled as she poured Walter a drink.

"Don't be in such a hurry. Drink this, and then I'll give you my answer."

Her voice was light and enchanting, making it hard for anyone to resist doing as she said.

Walter's heart pounded like a drum. He took the glass from Christina and drank it in one gulp. The alcohol burned in his stomach, and his courage soared.

"Tell me, Christina," he asked almost desperately.

Christina looked at him with an unprecedented softness in her eyes.

"Walter, are you really willing to stay for me?" she asked, her voice as light as a feather, tickling his heart.

Walter nodded without hesitation. "As long as you say the word, I'll go anywhere and do anything."

Christina smiled gently, her smile as soft and captivating as moonlight on a lake.

"Alright, Walter, I'll give you a chance. We can try being together." Her voice was low and firm.

Walter's heart nearly leaped out of his chest. He held Christina's hand tightly, afraid that this was just a dream that would vanish if he let go.

"Really?"

"I'm right here, telling you myself. How could it be fake?" Christina leaned her head on his shoulder.

Her embrace was warm, and she savored the tranquility of the moment.

"Christina, Christina, Christina, I love you. I'll love you forever," he repeated excitedly, his joy evident in his eyes.

After years of waiting, fate had finally smiled upon him!

Christina kissed him, her kiss deep and lingering.

But for some reason, after the initial rush of excitement and joy, a sense of unease settled in.

"Christina, wait!"

He tried to push her away.

Christina, already lost in the moment, held his strong hands.

"What are you waiting for? Our night is precious."

Despite the confusion in his heart, Christina's initiative made all his rational thoughts dissolve. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself, but it was nearly impossible.

His hands were tightly held by Christina, feeling the warmth of her body. His heartbeat quickened, and a hint of struggle flashed in his eyes.

"Christina, are we really going to do this?" he asked, his voice trembling slightly.

Christina looked up at him, her eyes a mix of daze and determination. She smiled softly and said, "Walter, isn't this what you've always wanted? Now, I'm giving you the chance."

Walter's mind flashed with countless memories, from their first meeting to every missed opportunity and every moment of heartache.

He had once thought the distance between them was so vast, almost impossible to bridge.

But now, Christina was right in front of him, reaching out to him.

His head suddenly felt dizzy, and the Christina before him smelled so intoxicating, directly stirring his heart.

He couldn't resist anymore. He cupped her face and kissed her.

As he touched her cold skin, he suddenly sobered up, his eyes widening.

"No, you can't be Christina."

This dream, crafted by 'Christina,' he had to break it himself.

A flicker of surprise crossed Christina's face. "What are you talking about? How could I not be Christina? Look at my face, isn't it hers?"

"You're not." Walter stepped back, nearly stumbling.

Christina froze.

"I am. Are you drunk?"

Her eagerness to be with him made Walter even more certain she couldn't be Christina.

"She doesn't love me. She wouldn't be this forward. Even if she accepted me, she would never..." Walter rubbed his dizzy head.

"You drugged the wine."

Christina pressed her lips tightly, saying nothing.

Honestly, she had hoped to win Walter over with her charm, but she didn't have enough confidence in herself, so she had drugged the wine she brought.

"You figured it out. I won't pretend anymore. Walter, I've liked you for so long. Why can't you accept me?"

Christina pressed closer.

Walter rubbed his head, suddenly realizing, "You're Rhea. How is this possible? This face..."

"Looks just like hers, right?" 'Christina' touched her own face, a pale smile appearing. "Do you know how much effort I put in? How much it took to turn Rhea into Christina?"

Walter could hardly believe his eyes. This living, breathing Christina had turned into Rhea.

He fought the discomfort in his body, reaching out to touch her cheek.

"How?"

Rhea pressed her face against his hand.

"I watched her every move, learned her inside out, and etched parts of her into my bones. I never thought it would be her lack of love for you that gave me away. Walter, do you know how cruel you are to me?"

Rhea's words were filled with bitterness and resentment, her gaze complex, mixing deep affection for Walter with jealousy and hatred for Christina.

Walter's fingers tightened slightly, trying to find a shred of truth in Rhea's words. But the scene before him was too absurd to accept.

He had always thought Christina was aloof and independent, while Rhea was the one obsessed with replacing her. But now, standing before him was Christina's image, speaking Rhea's name.

"Why did you do this?" Walter's voice trembled, feeling his worldview shatter.

Rhea smiled, a hint of sorrow in her smile. "Because I love you, because I want you. I know I'll never be Christina. I know I'm just a substitute. But I wanted to see if I could become the one in your heart."

Walter was shaken to his core, looking at Rhea with a hint of sympathy.

But soon, he regained his coldness. "What you've done only makes me hate you more."

###chapter 204  Where is Christina?

Rhea's smile faltered. She stared at Walter, her eyes brimming with pain and despair. "I know, I know everything. But even so, I'm willing to pay any price."

Walter was completely taken aback.

"Where's Christina?"

"Of course, she's the one you care about the most. Aren't you scared that if you piss me off, she might really disappear?" Rhea gritted her teeth.

She stepped closer, trying to soothe him. "Let's not talk about this, okay? Let's just enjoy the moment."

Walter mustered all his strength to push her away and rushed to the bathroom, splashing cold water on his face.

The icy winter water cleared his mind.

When he came out, Rhea was sitting there, looking at him with Christina's face, making him feel even more horrified.

She slowly stood up. "When I confessed to you with this face, you must have been happy, right? Did you think having this moment was already a miracle? Why did you have to shatter this dream, why did you have to expose me?"

Walter coughed. "Rhea, calm down."

"How can I calm down?" Rhea screamed hysterically. "I changed myself to look like her for you, gave up my own identity, and you still can't accept me. How can I calm down?"

Walter knew he had to keep her steady now.

Because Christina's safety was at stake, and besides, that face...

"So you really did all this for me. It must have hurt a lot to get surgery on your face, right?" Walter's eyes showed a hint of pity.

Just for that moment of expression, Rhea suddenly felt all her efforts were worth it.

"It didn't hurt!"

Walter sighed softly and reached out his hand. "Why go through all this?"

Rhea joyfully pressed her face against his hand. "As long as it makes you happy, I'm happy."

Walter did like that face, but he liked the person beneath it even more.

But at this moment, he had a more perfect plan in mind. He quickly stepped forward and embraced Rhea.

"Rhea, thank you for everything you've done for me, but I can't accept you right now."

"Why?" Rhea looked up, confused.

Walter began to explain slowly.

"You know that ever since Nicholas died, most of the Cavendish family fortune was taken by William with ruthless means. I want to forget everything and start over, but this matter is always a thorn in my heart."

"If I help you deal with him, can we be together?" Rhea asked innocently.

Walter lied without hesitation.

"Yes, I know you have money, but I don't want to rely on you. I'm the eldest grandson of the Cavendish family; those things should rightfully be mine."

"You have a good heart, but is it really that easy?" Rhea looked up and asked.

"It used to be difficult to get close to him, but now it's different. With your face, it's easy to get close to William." Walter said seriously.

Rhea's eyes lit up, as if she saw a bright path to happiness.

"Are you saying we can use this face, pretend to be Christina, get close to William, and then..."

Her voice trailed off, her eyes gleaming with ambition and ruthlessness.

Walter nodded lightly, his eyes filled with determination and calm. "Yes, Rhea. We can use this face to get everything we want."

Rhea's heart tightened. She knew exactly what Walter's words meant. But to be with him, to stand by his side openly, she was willing to pay any price.

"Okay, I'll do as you say," Rhea said softly, her eyes filled with resolve.

"What about Christina?" Walter couldn't help but ask.

Rhea's eyes instantly turned wary. "You're not just trying to keep me calm so you can save her, are you?"

"Of course not," Walter immediately denied.

"Don't worry, she won't be in any danger. Once we get married, I'll let her go," Rhea promised.

Walter quietly breathed a sigh of relief.

As long as she wasn't in danger, he could reclaim the Cavendish family and then bring Christina back!

The snow in Stargate City came unusually late.

The sky was thick with fog.

As the plane landed, Rhea glanced around.

"I really don't want to come back to this dump."

At her own home, she could do whatever she wanted, but here, she had to be more restrained.

With William's deliberate inquiries and the fact that they had already spread the news, William's low-key black business car was already waiting at the airport entrance when Rhea arrived.

"Christina, you're back?"

Rhea took a deep breath and walked over quickly.

"Yeah, you came to pick me up?"

"Yes." William smiled calmly.

Rhea took a closer look at him. She had never examined him so closely before and realized he wasn't bad-looking.

To be honest, part of the reason she liked Walter so much was because of his face. If she didn't love him so deeply, she might have taken this opportunity to transfer her affections.

"Do I have to get in?" Rhea forced a smile.

She remembered what Walter had said, that Christina and William also had unresolved issues, and their relationship wasn't that close.

So naturally, her attitude wasn't good.

"It's safer if I protect you." William's attitude was firm.

"Suit yourself!" Rhea pouted.

She got in the car and, as expected, was taken to William's villa.

"You've been away for so long. I'll take you out to eat later to welcome you back." William maintained a gentle demeanor.

This made Rhea feel particularly uncomfortable.

Why did all these men like Christina so much?

"No need, I'm not in the mood for that." She threw out the words and went upstairs, but having never been to the villa before, she forgot where her room was.

William suddenly appeared behind her.

"What's wrong?"

"I changed my mind. I don't want to stay here!" Rhea pouted.

"If you don't stay here, where do you want to stay? Christina, you are my wife." William smiled gently.

"Don't be so fake." Rhea snorted and went to the terrace.

Since she couldn't be sure, she decided to avoid going into any room!

William watched her back, feeling that something was off about her.

The snow scene remained, but Rhea's mindset had undergone a drastic change.

She looked at the snowy landscape outside, secretly sneering, a sarcastic smile curling her lips.

"Christina, who do you think you are, to make everyone like you?" Rhea muttered to herself, her eyes flashing with venom.

###chapter 205 This Woman Is Definitely Not Christina

She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying to calm herself down. But she knew her plan had just begun, and she needed to be patient.

William appeared behind her, gently wrapping his arms around her waist and resting his head on her shoulder.

"Christina, I missed you so much."

Rhea turned around and pushed him away.

"What are you doing? Being a creep?"

William stepped back. "Alright, I won't touch you. Get some rest."

He turned and went into the study.

This woman was definitely not Christina, he was sure of it!

It wasn't just her attitude; it was the feeling. He knew everything about Christina so well. From the moment he first saw her, he felt something was off.

He brought her back and tested her step by step, only to discover she really wasn't Christina.

But where did the problem lie? Who was this woman who suddenly appeared around him, using Christina's name?

He decided to bide his time and draw out the people behind her. Only then could he find the real Christina.

The next day at noon, he called out as he came home.

"I brought your favorite honey cake and some red wine steak."

There was no response.

He thought she might still be asleep, so he went straight to the room, but to his surprise, it was empty.

She shouldn't have gone out. He had instructed Bob to have a few bodyguards secretly watch her and notify him immediately if there was any sign of trouble.

As he was leaving the room, he saw the woman already in the hallway.

Rhea's face was full of panic. "Weren't you not coming back for lunch?"

"You just got back. I couldn't bear the thought of you eating lunch alone, so I brought lunch back." William smiled faintly and pointed downstairs.

"It's all set up. Let's go down."

He could tell she had come out of the study.

So he knew her purpose was related to the company.

Someone must be directing her. He needed to find a way to draw them out!

In the afternoon, he went into the study. After making sure she was eavesdropping outside, he put on a show.

"We must secure this area. I'm willing to stake the entire Cavendish Corporation on this major development. It's our best chance to turn things around."

"Don't try to persuade me. My mind is made up. Bring me the plan later!"

After a moment of silence, he continued, "It's okay. The money won't be tied up. Others don't know our trump card and don't want to cross the Cavendish family. To succeed, you need a gambler's mindset."

William hung up the phone and narrowed his eyes.

When he came out, Rhea almost got caught. She pretended to have just come out of the room.

"Christina!" William suddenly called out.

Rhea froze for a moment. "What do you want?"

William's voice was calm. "I have an important guest to meet later. Bob will bring a document. Can you sign for it and bring it to the study?"

"Why should I help you?" Rhea sneered.

"Because you're the one I trust the most." William lowered his eyes, looking sincere.

Rhea rolled her eyes. "Fine!"

William's gaze deepened.

The bait was set, and the fish would soon bite.

In the afternoon, Rhea waited a long time before Bob finally arrived.

Bob reminded her, "Mrs. Cavendish, it's best to put the document in the safe."

Rhea smirked. "He didn't say that. It's good enough that I'm signing for it."

With that, she closed the door.

Bob shook his head and said nothing.

The document was sealed. Rhea carefully examined it before using a small knife to open it bit by bit.

The plan was a gamble.

All of the Cavendish Corporation's money would be tied up in this project. If any risks arose, the Cavendish family would have no ability to withstand them.

Rhea was sure this was the opportunity Walter had mentioned!

She immediately called Walter.

"I found the opportunity. Can we meet?"

Walter narrowed his eyes. "Sure!"

They chose to meet at a bar. Rhea dressed up beautifully, wanting to show Walter her best side.

Her actions didn't escape the bodyguards' notice.

William received the news and followed her in his car, keeping a safe distance. Rhea had no counter-surveillance skills and went straight to the bar, sitting at the counter for a while.

Walter soon appeared.

"Rhea."

"You should thank me. I found a big loophole for you." Rhea smiled and placed the intercepted documents in front of Walter.

"Take a look. This should be useful."

"Thanks!" Walter glanced at the photos. "But William doesn't seem like that kind of person."

"Maybe the economy is bad, so he had to take a gamble." Rhea didn't care about the details.

She leaned in close to Walter, smiling.

"I've helped you so much. Shouldn't you reward me?"

Walter suppressed his discomfort and gave her a light kiss on the cheek.

"Thank you, Rhea."

Rhea's eyes lit up like stars, and she beamed with joy.

"Walter, you're so good. Don't worry, I won't hurt Christina. I'll send her back soon."

Walter spoke kindly, "I now realize the one who loves me most has been by my side all along. I was blind before. Rhea, you've done well."

"Can I come back now?" Rhea looked at him expectantly.

"No." Walter firmly refused. "It's not the right time. I need you to stay there and help me a bit longer."

Rhea was unhappy but agreed.

"Alright."

When William entered, he quickly spotted them at the bar.

Their eyes met, and sparks flew.

Walter pulled Rhea into his arms.

William walked over quickly. "It's you."

"Long time no see. Surprised?" Walter sneered.

"Very surprised." William glanced at Rhea, his eyes devoid of emotion.

Walter wanted to provoke him but saw no reaction. He found it strange. Given William's possessiveness over Christina, how could he be so indifferent?

He narrowed his eyes and grabbed Rhea.

"Come with me."

Walter just watched, saying nothing.

Outside, William shoved Rhea into the car and instructed Bob, "Keep an eye on Walter. I'll come back to talk to him later."

###chapter 206 Don't Make Things Difficult for Him

"William," Rhea called out urgently, "don't go after Walter."

She hadn't expected William to catch her meeting with Walter today.

His expression was so dark, and he had even given orders to Bob. He was definitely planning to make things difficult for Walter.

The thought made Rhea anxious.

But she couldn't show it too obviously; she was afraid William would notice something was off.

This was a critical moment, and she couldn't ruin Walter's plans.

"Do you care about him that much?" William's brow furrowed.

Even though he knew the woman in front of him wasn't the real Christina, just an imposter who looked exactly like her, seeing her show concern for Walter made him particularly uncomfortable.

Rhea felt a moment of panic but quickly composed herself.

She retorted, "Who I care about or don't care about is my business. But you, following me around like I'm some pet dog, how could you do that?"

William didn't miss the subtle change in her expression.

An imposter would always be an imposter, never the real thing.

He was tired of dealing with her. "I'll have the driver take you home now. We'll talk about this tonight."

"Walter has helped me a lot. If you make things difficult for him, then don't bother talking to me anymore," Rhea said, mimicking Christina's tone based on what Walter had told her earlier.

After all, Christina never gave William a good face.

Saying this wouldn't make William suspicious; instead, it would make him try to appease her.

William's eyes narrowed.

Anyone who knew him well would recognize that he was already angry.

The imposter's repeated mimicry was pushing his limits.

But now wasn't the time to tear off the mask.

"Go home," William said, shutting the car door.

The driver immediately locked the door and hit the gas.

By the time Rhea realized what was happening, the car was already far away.

She anxiously looked back through the window. "Stop the car, I need to go back."

"Mrs. Cavendish, Mr. Cavendish has instructed me to take you home. Please don't make this difficult for me," the driver said, clearly not intending to listen to her.

He worked for the Cavendish family and took orders from William, so naturally, he followed William's instructions.

Rhea had no choice but to stay in the car, her heart filled with worry.

She was really afraid William would harm Walter.

Meanwhile, Walter watched as Rhea was taken away by William. Though he expressed dissatisfaction, his expression remained unchanged.

He didn't love Rhea at all; her fate was irrelevant to him.

If it weren't for the fact that Christina was in her hands and his desire to overthrow William, he wouldn't have bothered with Rhea at all.

Even though they were currently partners, once his goal was achieved and Christina was safely rescued, he would settle the score with Rhea.

She dared to mess with Christina; she wouldn't get away with it.

For now, Walter was just pretending.

He had to put on a show for Rhea and William.

Soon, William returned. Seeing him, Walter quickly spoke up, "I was the one who asked Christina to meet today. Don't make things difficult for her."

"Christina is my wife. I wouldn't make things difficult for her," William said coldly. "You've got a lot of nerve."

He truly hadn't expected Walter to collaborate with another woman and pull a switcheroo.

If he hadn't been suspicious, he might have fallen for their trick.

"The Cavendish Corporation is already yours. I'm not competing with you. Can't I meet with Christina as a friend? Don't forget, we've known each other for a long time!" Walter's tone was urgent and loud as he accused William.

But he sat on the couch in a very relaxed manner.

This alone made William certain that Walter knew everything, and it was very likely that Christina was with him.

But now wasn't the time to expose it.

"I'll say it again, Christina is my wife. Think carefully before you act. You still have parents."

Walter didn't take this threat seriously.

Now that William was in charge, the rest of the Cavendish family had to follow his lead. But if the plan succeeded and the company transferred to Walter, no one would care about William.

Even his own parents would be the same.

No one would stop him from being with Christina. Others might have strong opinions, but they'd have to keep them to themselves.

"William, don't threaten me. Nicholas hasn't been gone long. Do you really need to turn on your family?" Walter began to play the moral card.

Nicholas had indeed favored William.

But with so many family members, everyone was related to Nicholas, and his bottom line was family infighting.

William's eyes narrowed.

"And Christina, anyone can see she doesn't like you at all. Yet you force her to be with you," Walter continued to provoke him.

Bob, standing nearby, could hardly bear to listen.

Whatever happened between William and Christina was their business. Who was Walter to interfere?

Especially since Walter had always coveted William's wife.

"If you have the guts, kill me. I'll tell Nicholas in the afterlife what you've done. Otherwise, you better let Christina go. She's a living person, not a toy," Walter continued to provoke William.

He was also testing him.

He didn't know if someone as sharp as William had been fooled by Rhea.

But he was sure of one thing: as long as it was Christina, William would never let go.

William was also observing his micro-expressions.

After Walter left, Bob reluctantly approached. "Mr. Cavendish."

"Drive me home. I need to see Christina," William said, standing up.

He wanted to see what other tricks this imposter had up her sleeve.

Bob felt a headache coming on. What a mess!

Walter had provoked William for so long. If Christina said anything more when they got home, even William's patience would run out.

But William had given the order, so Bob had no choice but to comply.

Soon, Bob drove to the Cavendish family mansion, and William got out of the car.

As soon as he entered the house, the anxious Rhea ran over. She had tried to disguise her worry, but her concern still showed in her eyes.

###chapter 207 Restricting Freedom

"What did you do to Walter? He's my friend, we've known each other forever, and he's helped me so much. If you hurt him, I'm outta here for good!"

Rhea tried to mimic Christina's tone, her voice full of threats.

William struggled to suppress the urge to strangle her. "Are you trying to negotiate with me?"

"Don't forget, you're my husband!"

"You tricked me into marrying you when I had amnesia. We were over a long time ago. No, we never even started!" Rhea glared at him, her eyes a mix of worry, anger, and guilt, but no hatred.

Christina wasn't like this. She hated him.

Since she was an imposter, there was no need for him to be polite.

William called the housekeeper over. "Keep an eye on her. From now on, she's not allowed to leave the house or see anyone. She'll stay home and behave."

"You're imprisoning me?" Rhea was both shocked and anxious.

She never expected that while she was imprisoning Christina, someone would imprison her too. And that someone was William, someone she couldn't defy.

If she was really confined at home and her contact restricted, she wouldn't be able to help Walter or find out Christina's situation. If the real Christina came back, she'd be caught red-handed as an imposter.

She glanced at the fruit knife on the table, quickly grabbed it, and held it to her own neck.

"Mrs. Cavendish, what are you doing?" The housekeeper was terrified and rushed over to stop her, trying to take the knife away. "We can talk this out, don't do this."

"I have nothing to say to him. I'm a grown woman, and you want me to stay home every day? William, are you crazy? No wonder no one loves you!" Rhea was furious.

"Mrs. Cavendish, please calm down," the housekeeper tried to soothe her and then turned to William. "Mr. Cavendish, she's just upset and speaking out of anger. Don't take it to heart."

William's response was cold. "Who pays your salary?"

The housekeeper fell silent immediately.

William's salary was far above the industry average, and the year-end bonus was the highest. She had worked there for three years and had already bought a house for her son. Now she was saving for her daughter's house. If she got fired, where would she find another job with such high pay?

"William, you're not only making things difficult for me but also for the housekeeper. Why did I ever meet you?" Rhea wanted to say more, but the housekeeper covered her mouth.

"Mrs. Cavendish, let's go back to the bedroom and rest."

Rhea didn't want to go back. She didn't know Walter's situation, and William hadn't told her anything since he returned, only that she was to be confined.

If she went back to the bedroom, it would be like admitting defeat. She didn't want that.

But the housekeeper's grip was strong, and she was forcibly taken to the bedroom. "Mrs. Cavendish, rest for a while. I'll make something delicious and bring it up."

"I won't eat it. I'd rather starve to death!"

The housekeeper relayed this to William.

"Mr. Cavendish, I can cook anything she likes, but I can't force her to eat."

"Let her starve if she wants. Just make sure she doesn't leave and report her every move to me." William didn't care if the imposter starved.

He turned and left.

The crucial information had already been given to Walter. Now it was up to him to act.

The housekeeper sighed, watching him leave. William clearly cared about Christina, but they were both too angry to be rational. If Christina got hurt, William would be the one to feel the pain.

She made Christina's favorite dessert and brought it upstairs, knocking on the bedroom door. "Mrs. Cavendish, I brought you something to eat."

"I don't want it. Take it away."

The housekeeper hesitated but opened the door and placed the dessert on the table. "Mrs. Cavendish, you're pregnant. Even if not for yourself, you need to eat for the baby. Couples fight, but you can't joke about your health. Isn't that right?"

The words hit Rhea like a thunderbolt.

Pregnant?

Christina was pregnant!

Now she was Christina, but her stomach was flat. How could she produce a baby?

The housekeeper mistook her silence for anger. "Mrs. Cavendish, I shouldn't say much, but as a mother, I know pregnancy. You're so thin, and if you don't eat, your check-up results will be bad."

Right, pregnancy required check-ups. Whether at a hospital or with a family doctor, she'd be exposed.

Rhea broke into a cold sweat.

She needed to get rid of the housekeeper and discuss this with Walter. "I understand. Leave the food on the table. I'll eat it later."

"Okay, Mrs. Cavendish. The dessert is best eaten warm." The housekeeper left.

At the door, Rhea glanced at the table. "Why is it crème brûlée?"

She had no interest in sweet, creamy desserts. They tasted like egg custard, unappetizing.

The housekeeper paused, confused. "I thought it was your favorite. Has your taste changed? I can make something else."

"No, this is fine." Rhea quickly corrected herself.

She took a bite of the crème brûlée, forcing it down.

Once the housekeeper's footsteps faded, Rhea locked the bedroom door and called Walter.

He answered immediately.

"Is William giving you trouble?" Walter asked, concerned.

Rhea's anxiety turned to joy. "Walter, you're worried about me, aren't you?"

###chapter 208 Finding a Way to Save Oneself

Walter didn't actually care about her well-being.

He frowned and brushed her off, "I'm worried William might make things tough for you. He just came by to threaten me."

"What? How could he do that?" Rhea was instantly anxious.

Right now, the Cavendish family was still under William's control.

Wouldn't that mean Walter was in danger?

But she couldn't even see him now, only worry alone, "William has me locked up at home, not letting me go out. But I can go to the study freely; he doesn't lock the door there. Tell me, what can I do for you now?"

"He's keeping you locked up?" Walter wanted to probe further.

He needed to confirm if William had discovered anything.

But Rhea's next words completely changed his plan, "Christina is pregnant. Even if I could get to you now, the timing wouldn't match. A check-up would reveal everything. We need to act quickly."

Walter fell silent.

He looked at the photo on his phone, a project contract Rhea had sent earlier.

His chance to take over the company was right in front of him.

And taking over the company meant he would become the most influential person in the Cavendish family. Then, no one could stop him from being with Christina.

Not even Gabrielle.

This was his only chance to be with Christina.

Whether William was suspicious or not, he hadn't done anything to Rhea yet. At least he wasn't sure Rhea was an imposter.

Instead of being cautious, he might as well take a bold step.

Walter's eyes gradually became resolute, "Hang in there a bit longer. Once I succeed, I'll bring you back immediately."

"Then let's get married right away, okay?" Rhea seized the opportunity to make her demand, "Let's go straight to City Hall. I want to marry you."

"Okay, we'll get the marriage certificate first, and then I'll give you a grand wedding. Whatever other women have, you'll have too," Walter continued to deceive her.

Rhea was lost in this lie, bubbling with happiness.

What she didn't know was that both Walter and William were sending people to track down Christina's whereabouts.

Meanwhile, Christina was trapped in a windowless basement, the door locked, and her feet chained, allowing only limited movement.

Rhea had left her some food, all dry and hard bread, just enough to stave off hunger.

Without sunlight, Christina had no idea what time it was or how many days had passed.

She searched the room for anything she could find, with only one thought in her mind.

She had to escape as soon as possible; she couldn't be trapped here forever.

She still had Harper. For her precious daughter, she had to find a way to save herself.

Fortunately, her efforts paid off. After carefully searching the basement, Christina found a piece of wire.

She quickly inserted the wire into the chain on her foot, gently moving it.

'Click'

A sound echoed in the quiet basement.

Christina finally freed herself from the chain. She rubbed her ankle, then took the wire to the basement door, crouching down to try to unlock it.

At the Cavendish Corporation...

To make the act convincing, William even held a high-level meeting about the fake project.

Many voiced their objections during the meeting.

"Mr. Cavendish, this project is too risky. If it succeeds, we'll all benefit, but if it fails, who will bear the cost?"

"Yeah, Mr. Cavendish, the company is in your hands now. You have the responsibility to develop it well, not to take risks that could jeopardize everything."

"If our funds get tied up and the other company squeezes us, we'll be in a very passive position."

William's gaze swept over the group.

Finally, his eyes landed on a bald man, "Luca, what do you think?"

Luca, suddenly called out, was momentarily stunned.

After regaining his composure, he quickly spoke, "Mr. Cavendish, I think the others have a point. This decision is indeed very risky."

"So you also oppose my proposal?"

Luca shook his head, forcing a smile, "Mr. Cavendish, we're all getting old and tend to be more conservative. But you're young, impulsive, and daring. I think taking a gamble isn't necessarily a bad idea."

Before he finished speaking, the person next to him glared at him angrily.

"Luca, you have the least shares in the company, so it's easy for you to talk. If the company loses money, it affects you the least!"

"That's not the point. Whether I have more or fewer shares, as long as I'm sitting here, I'm part of the company. Of course, I want the company to do better." Luca stubbornly refused to admit otherwise.

"If you really considered yourself part of the company, you wouldn't agree to take such a risk!"

"If we don't take risks, should we just stand still? If you have a better project, bring it up. If not, keep quiet. We can't just sit at home and expect money to fall from the sky!"

Seeing their argument escalating, William intervened, "Today's meeting is over. I've made my decision."

"Mr. Cavendish!"

No matter how anxious the others were, they could only watch as William got up and left.

Nicholas had left most of his assets to William in his will. After Nicholas's death, William had swiftly reclaimed many shares.

This made him the largest shareholder and the most influential person in the company.

Whatever he wanted to do, he could accomplish.

The meeting room erupted in chaos.

The executives couldn't confront William directly, so they turned their frustration on Luca.

"Luca, what you did was underhanded. You used to complain about the company's low market value, and now you're making us all take the risk!"

"I suspect you've been paid off by the rival company to cause trouble."

"If you don't need money, you can go do charity and donate all your assets."

Facing these accusations, Luca shrugged, "We have to be reasonable. I do want the company's market value to be higher. Business always involves risks. If we have differing opinions, we follow the majority. Whoever holds the most shares gets the final say."

###chapter 209  Just Want to Push Her to the Limit

The room was packed, but even if everyone combined their shares, they still wouldn't come close to William's.

What was the point of even mentioning that?

"This wasn't my idea to begin with. Giving me grief won't change a thing. Do you really think if I change my mind, Mr. Cavendish will too?" Luca gathered his things and stormed out.

Back in his office, he shut the door and immediately called Walter to report everything that had gone down in the meeting.

Luca wasn't content with the status quo. A few shares weren't enough for him; he wanted more-more money, more power.

So when the opportunity arose, he didn't hesitate to team up with Walter.

"I think William's head over heels for that woman. He's so wrapped up in love, he's lost all sense of reason. He's taking a massive gamble on this project-he's lost it," Luca said, his disdain for William clear.

The more tempting the prize, the greater the danger.

Plenty of companies were itching to take down the Cavendish family, all wanting a piece of the action. And now William was showing his weak spot.

He was practically begging for it.

Luca figured it was smarter to side with Walter now. When Walter took over as CEO, Luca would become the largest shareholder. Those who gave him a hard time in the meeting would be the ones crawling to him.

Just the thought of it made Luca feel incredibly satisfied.

Walter also breathed a sigh of relief. "We need to move fast. Once the company hits a financial crisis, William will have to sell his shares, and the shareholders will be up in arms."

As long as things got chaotic, he'd have his chance.

Luca grinned smugly. "It's all thanks to your foresight, Mr. Walter Cavendish. Or should I start calling you CEO?"

"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Keep an eye on William. I've already got Christina on our side; she'll help us."

"Really?" Luca was stunned.

He had no clue about the real and fake Christina situation, nor did he know the current Christina was an imposter.

All he knew was that William was head over heels for Christina. William had done so much to clear her name before.

And now Walter had managed to buy off Christina.

They were sure to win.

Luca hung up the phone, brimming with confidence, unaware that William had already seen through him. The executives in the meeting had just put on a show for him.

In the following days, William continued to work on the project openly.

Every night, he would go home and keep a close watch on Rhea.

At first, he didn't let her go out. Later, he even forbade her from using her phone or computer.

When Rhea got angry, William had an excuse ready: "You're pregnant now. Try to avoid electronic devices; the radiation isn't good for the baby."

"What century are you living in? How can you still believe that?" Rhea was furious.

If she hadn't heard it herself, she wouldn't have believed such outdated ideas could come from William's mouth.

When cell phones and computers first came out, there was indeed such a belief.

But over time, more and more doctors debunked it. Even people in remote rural areas didn't believe it anymore.

Yet William, who had received an elite education, firmly believed it!

"I'm already stuck at home all day. Now you want to take away my phone and even the TV. What am I supposed to do all day? Have you ever thought about how I feel?"

William's response was the same: "As parents, we can't let anything happen to our child."

"That's easy for you to say. As the father, you can go out whenever you want, use your phone as much as you like, and even keep your laptop with you. But as the mother, I have to make all these sacrifices. Why?" Rhea's eyes were blazing.

She never loved William. She stayed to play the role of Christina for Walter's sake.

She thought she could just go through the motions, steal the key project documents, and then return to the man she loved.

But things had escalated to this point.

She couldn't see Walter anymore. If she couldn't even contact him online, what was the point of staying here?

"If you keep pushing me, I'll abort the baby!" Rhea tried to use his concern for the child to threaten him.

She thought William would give in.

But reality was far from what she expected.

William's gaze swept over her flat stomach. "Starting next week, I'll have a family doctor come to check on you and the baby."

It was already Saturday, so next week meant the day after tomorrow.

The doctor William hired would surely be an expert. A check-up would reveal whether she was really pregnant.

Once the truth came out, she would be finished, and Walter would be implicated too.

Her only way out was to leave.

If William couldn't find her, he might not realize she was an imposter, which would divert his attention and give Walter a chance to act.

Rhea quickly formulated a plan.

She stopped arguing with William, only throwing a final angry remark: "You're so overbearing. I've had enough of you. You never consider my feelings!"

She stormed off, slamming the door behind her and locking it to show her protest.

The housekeeper saw it all and felt helpless.

William hadn't always been like this. He used to consider everything about Christina. When had he become so extreme and authoritarian?

"Take away all electronic devices. Don't let her touch them," William ordered.

He wanted to push the imposter to her limit and see what she would do.

The housekeeper didn't understand but had to follow orders. "I understand, Mr. Cavendish."

That night, the housekeeper took Rhea's phone while bringing her dinner.

Seeing Rhea's furious face, the housekeeper tried to comfort her: "Mrs. Cavendish, Mr. Cavendish is just very concerned about the baby. Once the family doctor confirms that both you and the baby are healthy, I'm sure Mr. Cavendish will ease up and stop being so controlling."

###chapter 210 Rhea Escapes

"Is it really your place to speak?" Rhea snapped, clearly irritated.

She was already on edge, and now the nanny had to come over and say something unnecessary.

How could she dare let the family doctor come for a check-up?

With no way to contact Walter, she was stuck here, helpless. Staying here felt like waiting for death.

No, she had to leave tonight.

The nanny had meant well, trying to comfort her, but since Rhea wasn't receptive, she stopped talking. "Mrs. Cavendish, remember to eat on time. I'll be outside if you need anything."

Rhea didn't even acknowledge her.

William had been in his study all evening, likely busy with his new project.

She waited until nightfall, then quietly opened her door and tiptoed barefoot to William's study. The door was tightly shut, and there was no light inside. It seemed William had already gone to bed.

The nanny had also gone to her room to rest. Her room was on the second floor, near the guest bathroom, far enough away that she wouldn't hear anything.

Taking advantage of the opportunity, Rhea left the Cavendish estate. After walking a short distance, she flagged down a taxi.

She quickly got in and gave the driver Walter's address.

Since she didn't have her phone, she borrowed the driver's and called Walter. "Walter, he's trying to get a family doctor to do a prenatal check-up. I can't stay here any longer. I'm coming to you now."

Walter didn't want to see her at all.

Just placating her online had drained all his patience, let alone meeting her in person.

Rhea, sounding shy over the phone, said, "It's too late tonight, City Hall is closed. Let's get our marriage license first thing tomorrow morning."

Walter's expression darkened. "We'll talk about that later."

"Walter, you promised me you'd marry me. We were going to have a cute baby together. I'm only staying with someone I don't love because of you. Are you backing out now?" Rhea's voice was filled with grievance.

The days she spent with William felt like years.

It was her love for Walter that kept her going.

If Walter backed out now, what was the point of everything she had done?

Rhea was always a bit extreme.

Otherwise, she wouldn't have kidnapped Christina after failing to win Walter's heart, trying to take her place.

Now, she was once again stuck in a loop. "Have you been lying to me all along? You said you loved me, but you won't even get a marriage license with me. You're still thinking about Christina. You love her!"

Lost in her sorrow, Rhea didn't notice the cars following them. The taxi driver, engrossed in the drama, didn't notice either.

"Rhea, how could you think that?" Walter wasn't ready to burn bridges yet, so he continued to placate her.

"Of course I want to marry you, but I want more than just the present. I want our future. William's put everything into this project, but I haven't taken him down yet. Just wait a little longer, give me some more time."

His words made sense.

But Rhea didn't want to wait any longer.

If they couldn't get married, she wanted to settle for less. "Then tonight, let's be together like a married couple. Is that okay? I'm not asking for much."

As long as she could have Walter, she didn't care how long she had to wait for a marriage license.

She was willing to stay with William and pretend.

She wanted something real, not empty promises.

Walter's face grew darker.

Being with someone he didn't love was torture. "Come over first, we'll talk about everything."

"Okay." Rhea finally hung up, satisfied.

Soon, the taxi arrived at Walter's place.

Walter paid the driver, and Rhea got out, throwing herself into his arms, clinging tightly to his back, inhaling his scent deeply.

It made her feel safe.

She looked up, tears streaming down her face. "I finally see you, Walter. I missed you so much."

She stood on tiptoe, trying to kiss Walter.

Just then, Walter saw headlights approaching.

This couldn't be a coincidence.

He realized immediately that Rhea had been followed!

He quickly pushed her away.

"Walter? Do you despise me that much? You weren't like this on the phone," Rhea said, feeling even more hurt and confused.

She didn't understand why, after everything she had done, she still couldn't warm his heart. He was as cold and unfeeling as a stone.

Until the car stopped in front of them.

William stepped out, exuding an intimidating presence. "Walter, you've crossed the line one too many times."

Things were different now.

Walter wasn't afraid of William anymore.

He even smiled. "How's the new project going? I heard you invested everything into it. If it fails, the other executives won't be happy with you."

"Nicholas always said the capable should lead. If you can't take the company to new heights, step down. We're family, I don't want to be too harsh."

He wanted William to live and see him happy with Christina.

Including the child Christina was carrying.

Boy or girl, that child would call him Dad!

Rhea looked at him with deep love and admiration.

This was the man she loved, so dazzling. How could she not be infatuated?

William couldn't stand seeing someone with Christina's face looking at another man like that.

He didn't want to waste words. "This project was just a show for you. Even if it were real, do you think I'd invest everything?"

The Cavendish Corporation wasn't anywhere near bankruptcy!

Besides, after graduating, he had started his own company. Though small, it was stable and profitable every year.

One project wasn't that important to him.

###chapter 211 Four Years Later

Walter was floored.

So, he'd been played?

William had clearly figured something was off a while ago. He hadn't said anything because he was playing along.

"Luca's your guy, right? He's been taken in for tax evasion. This has your fingerprints all over it, doesn't it?" William's tone was firm.

If Walter had stuck to the plan, his funds would've been tied up, and he wouldn't have been able to turn things around. They would've pinned the tax evasion charges on him.

Just then, a police car pulled up. Two officers got out, cuffed Walter, and took him away.

Rhea watched the whole thing, feeling like her world was falling apart.

They had been so close to happiness, holding each other tight, their beautiful future within reach.

But now, Walter was being taken away by the police.

Even with her limited knowledge, Rhea knew that tax evasion meant prison time.

When would they see each other again?

"William, no matter what, Walter is still part of the Cavendish family. Treating him like this goes against Nicholas's last wishes. You're being unfilial!" Rhea placed all her hopes on William.

If he was willing to show mercy, Walter could come out safely.

She didn't care about a life of luxury anymore. She didn't need to be a wealthy wife. She just couldn't accept a life without Walter.

William looked at her like she was already dead. "Do you think you have any leverage to bargain with me?"

"What about this child?" Rhea placed a hand on her stomach. "If you dare to harm him, I'll abort this baby."

"You're not the real Christina. Tell me where Christina is." William's voice was icy.

Rhea suddenly laughed. "No wonder you've been restricting me. You knew I was a fake all along. Christina isn't dead. She's alive and well. One life for another. Let my lover go, and I'll give you back yours."

William agreed to the deal.

Rhea bought the earliest flight ticket. She was going to bring Christina back to William.

But when she opened the door to the basement, it was empty.

She couldn't believe it and searched the entire house. All the jewelry and valuables were gone, and a mark was left on the wall.

As she tried to make sense of it, a news report caught her attention.

Rhea's eyes widened.

Her house was in a remote area with poor security, and there were two gangs nearby that often clashed.

She had chosen to keep Christina there because the police wouldn't search the area.

But she hadn't expected a serial killer to be operating nearby, who had murdered seven women and stolen their jewelry.

The key evidence was that the killer always left a mark on the wall.

Rhea had no choice but to tell William.

"You're lying to me!" William was instantly furious.

Christina couldn't be dead.

They had been given a second chance at life. He wanted to protect her and their daughter.

Everything had been resolved, and no one would accuse Christina of being a murderer. But because of Rhea...

Rhea anxiously explained, "I'm not lying. I really love Walter. I wanted to bring her to you in exchange for his safety, but..."

The more she explained, the angrier William became. At the same time, a deep sense of helplessness washed over him.

If he had investigated faster, Christina might have been back with him already, safe from harm.

No, he still didn't believe Christina was in danger.

He had to investigate himself!

Rhea knew William wouldn't help her anymore. She had to save Walter herself.

But what could she do alone to get Walter out?

There was only one option left.

She went to the police station under the pretense of visiting Walter. Looking into his eyes, she was filled with longing. "Walter, I'm getting you out today. They won't stop us."

"What are you planning? Where's Christina?" Walter blurted out.

She responded with a bitter smile.

Rhea unbuttoned her shirt, revealing a simple bomb strapped to her body. "Forget about her. Let's run away together. I've saved some money over the years. It's enough to support you. We'll both work, and our lives will only get better."

The police quickly noticed the situation on the surveillance cameras.

They tried to approach Rhea, but she made a scene, insisting on rescuing Walter or everyone would die together.

"Bang!"

A gunshot rang out.

Rhea's life ended there. She fell in a pool of blood, her eyes fixed on Walter, wanting to remember him forever.

If only there was no Christina.

They would have met, fallen in love, and been happier than anyone else.

She hoped that in the next life, she would meet Walter early on.

"Rhea?" Walter wasn't sad about her death.

Given what Rhea had done, she deserved it.

But he wanted to know if Christina was safe.

Unfortunately, Rhea had closed her eyes forever.

Four years later.

Valoria Airport.

Christina, dressed in a sharp, professional outfit, held her daughter's hand. "Harper, let's get something to eat first, then we'll check into the hotel, okay?"

"Mommy, can I have McDonald's?" Harper asked sweetly.

Looking at her daughter, Christina's heart melted.

Even though she had given birth to Harper alone in a foreign country, and even though Harper carried half of William's blood, she was still her Harper.

Her Harper was back, and that made everything worth it.

She picked up her daughter. "Sure, Mommy will take you there."

After they had eaten, the mother and daughter went to a nearby hotel. To make sure Harper was comfortable, Christina booked a deluxe suite. "Sweetie, Mommy has to work now. Stay in the hotel, okay? If you need anything, call Mommy. Don't go out on your own."

Although Stargate City had good security, Harper was still so young. Christina couldn't help but worry.

Harper nodded vigorously. "Don't worry, Mommy. I can play by myself."

Christina kissed her daughter's cheek before leaving.

She had returned to take charge of a project. To get a promotion and a raise, and to give Harper a better life, she had chosen to come back to this land.

###chapter 212  What Is Her Name?

After arriving at the local branch, Christina quickly wrapped up all the necessary paperwork.

The person handing over the work to her was a short-haired girl who was very efficient. "Ms. Windsor, I've got all the project materials. Since today's Friday, I'll go over everything this weekend, and we can dive into the details when you come in on Monday morning."

"Sounds good," Christina replied with a smile.

She planned to use the next couple of days to find a place to rent. Staying in a hotel with her daughter indefinitely wasn't an option.

Sure, the hotel had great service and daily housekeeping, but she'd be in the country for at least a few months. Renting a place would be cozier and give Harper more room to play.

She also needed to find a preschool for Harper.

"Oh, Ms. Windsor, let's exchange contact info. It'll make it easier to stay in touch." The short-haired girl pulled out her phone and added Christina as a friend.

When she saw Harper's photos on Christina's Facebook, her eyes lit up. "Your daughter is adorable! What's her name?"

"Her name's Harper."

"She's so cute. Having a daughter must be wonderful. When I get married, I want a daughter too, so I can dress her up like a little princess," the girl said genuinely.

Harper had inherited the best features from both her parents.

Her eyes were big and sparkling, like two grapes, and her cheeks were rosy with a bit of baby fat, making her irresistibly kissable.

Looking at her daughter's photo, Christina's gaze softened.

What she had once lost was now finally back.

This time, she was determined to protect her daughter at all costs.

"By the way, I've been abroad for years and just got back. I need to rent a place. Do you have any recommendations for neighborhoods?" Christina asked before leaving.

The short-haired girl laughed, "Of course! The neighborhood I live in is great. I'll send you the contact info for my real estate agent. She can show you some places over the next couple of days."

After thanking her, Christina left the office.

No time like the present, Christina contacted the agent right away to look at some apartments. She viewed three in total, each with its own pros and cons.

"Ms. Windsor, the first apartment is the cheapest, the second has the best floor, and the third, though pricey, uses high-quality materials for the renovation. Even the wood furniture is top-notch," the agent explained.

Christina didn't hesitate, "I'll take the third one. I'm living with my child."

She was willing to spend more for a well-renovated place to ensure Harper's safety.

"If you have a child, I definitely recommend this one. I'll contact the landlord to see if we can negotiate the price a bit."

"Regardless of the price, I'll take it. I need to find a preschool for my child today. Once you've talked to the landlord, we can sign the contract." Christina appreciated the agent's diligence and was straightforward herself.

Before returning to Stargate City, Christina had already researched preschools online and spoken with the teachers. Since she had some time today, she decided to visit the preschool in person.

The preschool was just a short walk from the neighborhood, a private institution.

Christina had messaged the teacher in advance, who was waiting at the entrance. "Ms. Windsor, the students are still in their last class. Would you like to take a tour of the school?"

"Absolutely," Christina replied, eager to see the place for herself.

Although the preschool had great online reviews, she preferred to get a firsthand look and feel the atmosphere.

"Follow me," the teacher said, leading the way.

As they walked, the teacher explained, "We use a small class system here, with only 12 students per class and a life teacher to take care of daily needs."

"For things like nap time and meals, we update parents in a group chat. Here are some pictures for you to see."

As they continued the tour, Christina grew more satisfied. The proximity to home also made it convenient for drop-offs and pick-ups. "I'll sign the contract and bring my daughter tomorrow to start school."

After paying, the teacher added Christina to the parents' group chat and escorted her to the gate.

Christina took a taxi back to the hotel.

Of course, she didn't forget to pick up dinner for her daughter on the way.

As soon as she opened the door, Harper ran out and hugged her tightly. "Mommy, you're back! I missed you so much. Did you bring something yummy? I can smell it!"

Harper sniffed eagerly.

Seeing her like this, Christina smiled, "Yes, I bought dinner. We had burgers for lunch, so how about pasta for dinner?"

"Yes!" Harper nodded enthusiastically.

Her mom was busy with work and still made time to buy her food. She was grateful for whatever she got. "Mommy, let's eat together. You must be tired. I wish I could grow up faster to take care of you."

Christina chuckled.

She lifted Harper onto a chair and set the dinner on the table. They enjoyed the meal together.

Watching her daughter eat heartily, Christina's smile never faded. "Harper, Mommy doesn't need you to take care of me. I just want you to grow up healthy and happy. That's my biggest wish."

This was different from Elisa.

Elisa wanted to control her life, making her marry a wealthy man and live a stable life.

Having experienced it all firsthand, Christina didn't want her daughter to suffer the same. "Let's get a good night's sleep tonight. Tomorrow, I'll take you to preschool, and in the evening, we can move into our new home."

"Really? I can make lots of new friends!" Harper clapped her hands in delight.

Christina was also infected by her daughter's excitement.

Once she handled everything, she planned to visit Elisa.

After all, Elisa was her biological mother, and with her in the late stages of cancer, Christina had been away for four years.

Now that she was back, it was only right to visit, see how Elisa was doing, and help with anything she could.

In the following days, Christina balanced work and home, adding many touches to make the house feel more like a home.

###chapter 213  Unexpected Encounter

But there was so much to do at the office.

From five in the morning until four in the afternoon, Christina had been swamped. She tidied up her desk and turned to her colleague, saying, "I'm heading out now."

"Alright, I'll leave once I finish up here," her colleague replied.

Christina went to the basement, got her car, and drove out. Lately, work had been overwhelming, and her mood was low as she drove.

But as she neared the preschool, she forced herself to perk up.

After all, no matter what, she couldn't bring her bad mood to her child.

With that thought, Christina parked by the curb, touched up her lipstick in the mirror, and, feeling a bit more presentable, managed a smile as she got out of the car.

There was still some time before the preschool let out, so Christina stood by the entrance to wait.

When she looked up, she saw a familiar face approaching.

The person was dressed in black, with neatly combed hair, walking in her direction.

Christina felt puzzled but didn't want to interact with this person for various reasons, so she instinctively turned away.

Just then, the preschool bell rang.

Harper, who was in the younger class, was one of the first to come out.

Seeing Harper with her little pigtails walking out, Christina's heart melted.

She didn't think about anything else.

Christina was about to wave when the person in black approached her again.

William seemed to notice Christina for the first time and looked surprised.

"Are you here to pick up a child?"

Though William didn't say it outright, his expression showed his surprise.

Christina didn't want to engage, but with so many people watching, ignoring him seemed inappropriate.

She turned to William with a cold expression.

"What does it matter to you?"

"Mommy, I'm here."

At that moment, Harper's innocent voice called out. Christina crouched down and hugged her child.

After greeting the teacher, she was ready to leave with Harper.

But a little boy ran by so fast that he almost bumped into Christina. She instinctively stepped back.

The boy ran straight into William's arms.

"Dad Cavendish, you finally came to pick me up. I missed you so much."

The boy said, snuggling into William.

"You little rascal, did you listen to your teacher today?" William's usually cold face softened, and his tone became gentle.

"Of course, the teacher said I was very good today and even gave me a flower."

Christina frowned slightly at this but said nothing, holding Harper as they walked towards the car.

"What happened at school today, Harper?"

On the way, Christina tried to distract herself by talking to Harper.

"Can you share with Mommy?"

"Of course, Mommy. The teacher told us many things and taught us how to make crafts."

"I really liked the flower."

Harper's speech wasn't very fluent yet, but her big eyes blinked adorably, and her innocent tone melted Christina's heart.

"That's great, Harper. You're so talented."

Meanwhile, William realized Christina had walked far away.

He sighed helplessly.

The child in Christina's arms left him puzzled.

He wondered if that child could be Harper.

Could she be his and Christina's child, or was Christina just helping someone else pick up their kid, like him?

Lost in thought, he almost tripped over a stone while walking with his friend's child.

"Dad Cavendish, what are you thinking about?"

"Nothing. Do you want to go to my place first, or should I take you home?"

Though the boy was young, he had strong opinions, so William always asked for his input.

"I want to go to your place. My dad never has time for me, and I don't want to stay with him."

William sighed silently.

He ended up taking the boy home.

Coincidentally, William and Christina met again at a red light.

Christina's window was half-open, while William's was fully closed.

He could see out, but she couldn't see in.

William watched Christina's profile, ready to ask the question he hadn't finished earlier.

As he opened his window, the light turned green, and Christina sped off.

He wanted to follow, but she turned at the next intersection.

They went their separate ways, and he had to give up the idea.

Back home, William let the boy play while he called his friend.

"When are you coming to pick up your son? If this keeps up, you might as well give him up."

His friend, seemingly busy, explained helplessly.

"You know how it is here. I'll come as soon as I can. My kid is a handful, sorry for the trouble."

With that, William couldn't say much more, just urging his friend to come quickly.

After hanging up, he stared at his phone.

He wanted to contact Christina. With his resources, he could easily find her.

But after all his efforts, all he got from Christina were cold looks and sarcastic smiles.

It left him feeling helpless.

He knew he had made mistakes, and he deserved this. There was no room for regret.

After much thought, he decided to contact Christina.

Back at home, Christina washed Harper's hands and started cooking.

"Who are you?"

William, excited as the call connected, walked to the balcony, ready to say something.

But he heard a child's voice.

He paused.

Though he hadn't seen clearly at the preschool, he remembered it was a little girl.

"I am..."

He didn't know how to continue.

He didn't know how to define his relationship with Christina. Friends? That didn't seem right.

But any other label would only anger Christina.

"Uncle, wait a moment. Mommy is making something delicious. Should I call her?"

Harper's logic was still developing, but she knew the call was for Christina.

"No need."

William almost panicked and hung up.

"Dad Cavendish, who were you talking to? Why are you so nervous? Do you have a girlfriend?"

Ignoring the child's teasing, William picked him up and placed him on the sofa.

"Don't talk nonsense. Since you have no homework, look at your picture books. Your dad will pick you up later."

He instructed the butler to prepare dinner for the boy and went to his study.

He felt he needed to clear his mind.

Meanwhile, Christina finished cooking and found Harper quietly reading a picture book.

###chapter 214 Problems Arise

"Did I just hear you talking? Who were you chatting with?"

Christina knelt down beside Harper, her voice soft and curious.

Harper pointed to the phone on the couch. "Some guy called you. I asked what he wanted, but he didn't say anything and just hung up."

Christina felt a wave of confusion wash over her.

Still, she picked up the phone to check, just in case it was something important.

When she saw it was an unfamiliar number, she had a hunch.

After all, she had seen William today. Though neither of them had said much, his eyes had spoken volumes.

The thought made Christina chuckle.

He already had a child to keep him company, yet he was still thinking about her.

Was it the allure of the unattainable, thinking she should always revolve around him?

But Christina wasn't sure if it was William. So, she played an old recording of William's voice for Harper.

"Was it this man who called?"

Harper listened for a moment before nodding slowly. "Yeah, Mom."

Christina's smile turned cold. She lifted Harper onto the dining table, blocked the number, and then joined Harper for dinner.

"Mom, dinner smells so good. I want more."

Watching Harper eat made Christina happy too.

"Alright, if Harper likes it, Mom will make it often."

Christina felt her current life was perfect.

She didn't have to think about all the messy things. She could be with her child and make up for past regrets.

As long as she stayed away from William, everything would be fine.

"Thank you, Mom."

Since starting kindergarten, Harper had become very polite and well-behaved, a change Christina hadn't seen in her previous life. Maybe it was because of all the changes since her rebirth, but Harper's personality was now impeccable.

In Christina's eyes, even if Harper were a bit spoiled or had a temper, she could handle it. After all, Harper was her precious child, lost and found again.

After dinner, Christina spent some time exercising with Harper.

Then she read a picture book to Harper.

"Mom, why does Cinderella have to be with the prince?"

Harper's logic was still developing, and her speech was unclear, but she felt it didn't make sense.

"Maybe that's just how the story goes. Cinderella has her own choices; she doesn't have to be with the prince."

To Christina, mismatched couples often ended badly, like her and William in her past life.

That situation had already caused enough pain. Christina didn't want to repeat it.

Thinking of William, Christina couldn't help but recall his expression.

Every time she saw him, he looked sorrowful, guilty, and cautious, as if he were trying to make amends.

But in reality, he was the one who had hurt her.

"Alright, let's go to sleep now. Mom will read you another book tomorrow, okay?"

After putting Harper to bed, Christina got to work.

"Send me the previous design draft," she messaged a colleague.

The colleague's response was hesitant.

"What's wrong?" Christina typed, adding two question marks.

"Well, we might not be able to use it. There's already something similar online."

Christina was puzzled and started searching for the related content online.

She found that their competitor had already released a similar plan, and it had garnered a lot of support.

"How is this possible? We just decided on this plan this morning. How did they release it tonight? What went wrong?"

"At first, I thought it was our fault, but they also changed some details. Technically, it's not plagiarism."

If that were the case, the situation was more complicated.

"Got it."

Christina rubbed her temples, lifting her head from the computer.

Starting the studio hadn't been easy. She had wanted to create a brand centered on maternal love.

Though the initial response was good, many had seen the potential for profit and started copying their ideas.

As a result, the original work lost its momentum, while the imitators thrived.

After some thought, Christina posted in the work group, "Since that's the case, we'll have to go with Plan B."

If she could secure that collaboration, they wouldn't have to worry about the competitor, and they could forge their own path.

"Got it, boss," her team replied.

Christina finished her work and went to bed, holding Harper close.

The next day, after dropping Harper off at school, she headed to the studio.

She found everyone already there, looking worried.

"That Plan B you mentioned yesterday has also been preempted by the same company," her assistant informed her as she entered the office.

Christina smiled at the team.

"This studio isn't that big. It shouldn't be hard to find out who leaked the information. If someone steps forward now, I might be lenient. But if you push me, I'll have to involve the authorities."

With that, Christina went into her office.

"Ask everyone. I trust you. Don't let me down," she told her assistant before they left.

The assistant looked uncomfortable but nodded.

After questioning everyone, the assistant had no results.

"Fine. If no one confesses, we'll have to halt everything. If we can't present new products at the launch, we'll just have to take the loss."

In the meeting, Christina was firm. She didn't know who was responsible, but she was sure it was an insider. Outsiders wouldn't know so many details.

The competitor seemed to have a precise understanding of their plans.

"Boss, we can't be so extreme. We still have to work."

"If these two plans don't work, we'll come up with others."

"Yeah, it might not be as effective, but we can't delay the launch."

The team discussed their ideas.

"I agree. We can't let this affect our progress."

They meant that while finding the mole was important, it shouldn't hinder the company's progress.

Christina's smile turned icy as she slammed the plans on the table.

"What? You don't think this is serious?"

"If we can't find the mole, we'll have to suffer in silence. Or do you think these two plans weren't enough of a lesson, and you want to give away more ideas?"

Her words silenced the room.

###chapter 215  Help

"No, that's not what we meant."

After an awkward silence, the assistant jumped in to break the tension.

"Not what you meant? Then what did you mean?"

"Didn't I make myself clear earlier?"

"Or do you think you're better than me? If that's the case, why am I leading this project? Maybe you should pitch it to someone else."

Christina had put in a lot of effort to secure this project.

The partner had promised to give them a shot to showcase their product.

If it was good, the partner would invest, and they might even have the chance to go public.

This way, they could grow from a small studio into a full-fledged company.

But now, the first step had already fallen apart.

No need to mention what would come next.

"No, that's not what we meant."

Several people quickly explained, hoping Christina wouldn't get mad.

But the more Christina spoke, the more frustrated she got.

Just then, Carl Ward, the partner who had promised to collaborate, called.

"I want an explanation. I just got back from an out-of-town meeting. Didn't you say these products were your designs? Why did they appear in the preview release?"

His blunt questioning caught Christina off guard.

"Mr. Ward, it seems someone within the company leaked our designs, but rest assured, these are definitely my original creations."

Christina thought for a moment and decided to be honest with him.

But Carl wasn't having it.

"Whether it was someone from your studio or another reason, it doesn't matter to me. I just want an answer."

"If you can't give me one, I'll have to find someone else to work with."

He hung up before Christina could respond.

Everyone in the meeting room had heard Carl's loud voice.

Christina looked coldly at everyone.

"You all heard that, right? Or do you think my studio has been around too long and it's time for it to shut down?"

With that, Christina got up and went back to her office.

Everyone in the meeting room exchanged glances.

"What do we do now?"

"It's not our fault. Why are we being blamed?"

But as they discussed, they fell silent again.

Christina returned to her office and tried to contact Carl to explain.

Carl didn't respond for a long time. Eventually, he sent a location and a message.

"Meet me here. I want to see your sincerity."

After hesitating for a while, Christina grabbed her bag and headed to the location.

The studio was just starting out, and Christina couldn't afford to be proud.

On the way, Christina became more determined to become stronger.

When she arrived, she realized it was William's place.

But she thought it was just a coincidence and went to the private room as Carl had requested.

At the door, she heard voices inside. She was a bit surprised, as Carl hadn't mentioned how many people would be there. But since she was already there, she had no choice but to go in.

As soon as she opened the door, she saw William sitting at the head of the table. They exchanged glances.

Christina quickly turned her head and saw Carl sitting nearby. She went over to greet him.

"Mr. Ward."

"You're here. Great. Everyone here has some connection to your industry. Find a seat. If you can convince me today, I won't hold the online incident against you and will continue to invest."

Christina hesitated, unsure whether to stand or sit.

William, noticing her hesitation, offered her a seat between him and Carl.

"Mr. Cavendish, do you know each other?" Carl noticed William's small gesture and looked a bit ingratiating.

Before Christina arrived, he hadn't considered this possibility. Although Christina was attractive, her studio was just starting out and had many shortcomings.

"Yeah, we know each other," William said, his gaze lingering on Christina.

Christina avoided eye contact with William and focused on Carl. "What kind of proposal do you want to hear? I can explain it now. It might not be detailed, but I have a general idea."

Carl had initially wanted to leverage his connection with William. If Christina knew William, everything would be easier. So, after confirming this, Carl's expression changed subtly. He even looked at Christina differently.

Christina was puzzled, but Carl laughed. "Oh, this is a small matter. If you had told me you knew Mr. Cavendish, I wouldn't have made you come all this way."

Carl's attitude did a complete 180, and Christina's lips twitched. William, amused, sipped his wine and watched Christina. Feeling uncomfortable under his gaze, Christina glared at William. He raised an eyebrow, his meaning clear despite his silence.

"Really? I thought Mr. Ward and I were just business partners. I don't know the other bosses here. If I'm interrupting your business, we can discuss my matter another time."

Christina didn't want to get entangled in this situation. She prepared to leave. But as she stood up, William grabbed her wrist.

"Why the rush? Aren't you here to discuss business? Tell us your proposal. If it's good, the Cavendish Corporation is willing to invest."

William's words excited everyone present. They had tried many times to meet with William, and this was their first successful attempt. He had gathered people who didn't know each other. Everyone was looking for an opportunity to impress, but they didn't expect William to offer it to Christina.

They thought Christina would go along with it, but she just sneered. She coldly addressed William. "I don't care."

"If I had known Mr. Ward and Mr. Cavendish were collaborating, I wouldn't have come."

Christina didn't want to offend Carl, but his sycophantic attitude after learning she knew William was too much.

"Don't be like that, Ms. Windsor. No matter what happened between you and Mr. Cavendish, let's talk it out. We can only do business if we clear things up, right?"

Carl tried to persuade Christina. The others, sensing the unusual relationship between William and Christina, also chimed in. They hoped that if William and Christina collaborated, their own projects might progress.

Christina didn't want to explain her relationship with William or let them succeed. As they spoke, she considered many possibilities but ultimately decided not to go against her instincts.

###chapter 216  Not Accepting This Olive Branch

"Thanks for your concern, but there's nothing left to say between us."

With that, Christina didn't bother with pleasantries and walked straight out the door.

The room fell into an awkward silence.

Though they weren't as powerful as William, they didn't expect to be dismissed so blatantly.

Each of them thought, no matter who Christina was, they'd make things difficult for her later.

William seemed to read their minds.

He tapped his fingers lightly on the table, a faint smile playing on his lips, but his words were icy.

"I gave you this opportunity, but it's best not to mess with Christina."

That single sentence made his stance clear.

Carl quickly chimed in, eager to please.

"Oh, Mr. Cavendish, you misunderstand. I think Ms. Windsor is very talented. I was just looking to invest and wanted to hear more opinions."

"Exactly, Carl's right. Ms. Windsor's presence just now was impressive."

With William's position made clear, no one dared to think otherwise.

"Alright, since you all feel that way, I'll give you some face. Send the proposal to my assistant. I'll review it and get back to you."

With that, William stood up, grabbed his coat, and left.

Carl was quick to follow, "Mr. Cavendish, wait, let me see you out."

But by the time he got outside, William was already gone.

Christina sat in her car downstairs, not starting the engine.

Why did she keep running into him?

William had come down as quickly as he could, but he still didn't see her familiar figure.

He sighed, feeling a bit down, but then he turned and locked eyes with Christina, who was staring straight ahead in her car.

After a moment's hesitation, he walked over and knocked on her window.

"Can we talk?"

Christina hesitated for a long time before rolling down the window.

William took the liberty of getting into the passenger seat.

"What do you want?"

Since regaining memories of her past life, Christina had been particularly cold towards William.

Gone was the aloofness he had upstairs. He now looked at her with a hint of pleading. "Do you need help with your company?"

Though phrased as a question, his eyes were eager, as if ready to support her studio to success, even to the point of going public, if she just nodded.

"If you have time to worry about me, why not worry about someone else?"

"And if I had known you were going to be there today, I wouldn't have gone."

These were Christina's true feelings.

William felt a pang of disappointment.

"I know I wronged you, but if you're determined to make a name for yourself, why not use the resources available to you?"

Christina turned to him, her expression shifting from cold to mocking.

"Yeah, why not use those resources? But what good would it do? It would only remind me of painful memories. I never expected this industry to be so small."

Christina had chosen this path precisely because William's company wasn't involved in it.

She thought she'd never run into him.

But fate had other plans, and here they were, sitting at the same table despite being in different fields.

"Don't get me wrong, I didn't know you'd be there today. But I genuinely want to help you, as a way to make amends."

William wasn't sure what else to say.

Christina laughed coldly at the word "amends."

"Forget it. Are you trying to make amends, or is it just that you can't stand not having what you want? You know as well as I do that some things, once lost, can never be regained."

"Alright, Mr. Cavendish, please get out. I need to go."

Christina didn't want to argue with William any longer. He sighed and got out of the car.

"By the way."

Just as he was about to leave, Christina's voice stopped him. He turned back, hopeful she might say something to ease the tension.

But her next words crushed that hope.

"I know you have a lot of power, but I hope you won't bother me in the future. I have my own life."

"Sorry, I understand."

As soon as William closed the door, Christina turned the car around and sped off.

Carl and the others, who had come down from the building, noticed the scene.

Though gossip was natural, none of them dared to gossip about William.

So they stood in the hotel lobby, trying to be inconspicuous.

They were just waiting for William to leave, knowing it wouldn't be good to run into him.

But William was lost in thought and didn't notice them.

It wasn't until Christina's car was out of sight that he called his assistant. Within minutes, his car was brought to the entrance.

Once William drove off, the others finally emerged.

"I think there's something between Mr. Cavendish and Christina. Carl, you should seize this opportunity."

Carl scoffed, "You think I don't know that?"

They all went their separate ways.

Christina returned to her studio, feeling heavy-hearted.

Seeing her mood, everyone kept their heads down, not wanting to draw her attention.

"Prepare for a meeting in ten minutes."

Christina pushed aside her heavy feelings, planning to root out the mole and redesign their strategy.

Since this path was blocked, she'd have to find another way.

After all, she'd burned her bridges at that dinner.

Given their tendencies, it would be lucky if they didn't blacklist her from the industry.

Christina didn't know why she was acting this way.

Maybe it was the memories of her past life that made it impossible to pretend in front of William.

"What's wrong, boss?"

Her assistant was curious about the outcome of the meeting.

"Nothing much, just need to explore a new direction."

Once everyone was gathered in the meeting room, she asked about their recent activities.

"Fiona, Nina, how have I treated you two?"

The two women she addressed stood up, looking nervous.

"You've been very good to us, boss. The pay is the highest in the industry."

"Then why did you do this?" Christina threw the proposal in front of them. "Is this the design you came up with? Staying late every day just to give me this half-hearted work?"

"Do you remember how you got into this company? I gave you a chance when you were about to be exploited as free labor right out of college. Is this how you repay me?"

Fiona and Nina were terrified by Christina's words.

"Boss, we don't understand. We've been working late, but we just haven't had any inspiration..."

###chapter 217 Exceptionally Smooth

Fiona was about to argue, but Christina pulled up her social media account and shoved it in front of her.

"Care to explain this?"

"I know you two don't have that kind of money. Your families are pretty average. So why'd you suddenly buy all these luxury items last week?"

Fiona and Nina started trembling at Christina's words.

The rest of the team began to catch on.

They all pulled out their phones to look for clues.

"Yeah, Nina, I remember your phone wasn't this brand before. I saw you showing it off the other day. I thought maybe you bought it on credit."

"If what the boss is saying is true, then you two are really heartless."

The team had been anxious about the situation for days, but they never suspected Fiona and Nina.

"You must be wondering how I found out, right?"

Seeing their fearful and confused expressions, Christina crossed her arms and stared coldly at them.

"On my way back, I was thinking about who would do something so unethical."

"I considered everyone, but never you two. After all, I personally brought you in. But sometimes the truth is the most disappointing."

Christina laid out the evidence in front of them and asked again.

"Do I need to show more?"

Fiona and Nina hung their heads in silence, the meaning clear.

"No need, boss. We were wrong."

They spoke in unison.

The rest of the team was in disbelief.

They made such a huge mistake and just said sorry? If they were let off the hook, wouldn't everyone think they could do the same?

"It's too late. I gave you a chance today. Save your explanations for the authorities."

Christina pulled up the office surveillance footage and posted the relevant content online.

Even though their studio couldn't compete with the other company, Christina knew that if she didn't protect her interests now, no one would care later.

The other company quickly started damage control when they saw Christina's posts.

But Christina had solid evidence, and the other company's new product was already out, causing a huge uproar.

Christina had thought it through on her way back.

She had no one to worry about, so she didn't fear the consequences of her actions.

The studio was newly established, but if she couldn't protect her rights now, future endeavors would be hindered.

Nina and Fiona were taken away by the authorities.

Christina thought she was just reclaiming her rightful interests, but she didn't expect to go viral online.

Many private clients reached out to place orders with Christina.

It turned into a form of reverse publicity.

"If you have any difficulties in the future, feel free to talk to me. Although the studio is new, everything is negotiable. I don't want another incident like Nina and Fiona's."

"Got it, boss."

After Christina's message in the group chat, she saw everyone's responses and finally relaxed.

But when she returned to her office, she saw several missed calls.

"Mr. Ward."

Christina returned the call, expecting Carl to be as indifferent as before.

But to her surprise, Carl's tone was warm and friendly. "Ms. Windsor, your performance this time really impressed me. The investment I mentioned before will continue. Don't worry, if anything like this happens again, call me, and I'll handle it."

Christina was puzzled.

"What do you mean?"

"I mean, I'll invest in your company's products. You'll definitely make a profit."

His words confused Christina even more.

At dinner, Christina had made it clear she didn't want any ties with William.

If these people were collaborating with William, Christina definitely wouldn't get involved.

Especially Carl, who had been overly flattering when he learned about her connection to William, making Christina uncomfortable. So she had been very direct.

But now Carl's words left her baffled.

"Don't misunderstand. It's not for any other reason. I just admire your talent." Carl guessed Christina might be overthinking.

"But that day I..."

Christina hesitated.

Carl laughed. "The workplace needs people like you. If everyone bows to power, what then?"

"Besides, what you said was true."

This left Christina completely bewildered.

So Carl appreciated her straightforwardness? He wasn't very enthusiastic before, but now he was happy because of what she said?

The thought gave Christina goosebumps.

"But I think..." Christina didn't know how to continue.

Carl guessed her concerns. "Oh, come on. I'm older than you by a decade. I've seen more of the world. Don't overthink it. I did have reservations before, but after that incident, I promise, if you have any ideas, tell me. If they're feasible, I'll invest."

"Alright, that's it for now. I'll transfer the investment funds to your studio shortly."

Carl hung up, leaving Christina staring at her phone in a daze.

Besides Carl, several other calls came in, all seeking collaboration.

And they weren't private clients. Christina, still in a daze, secured two more deals.

By the end of the day, Christina felt everything was surreal.

Opportunities she never dared to dream of were now pouring in.

And the terms were simple, but something felt off.

Though happy about the collaborations, the sudden influx made Christina uneasy.

After putting Harper to bed, Christina started piecing everything together.

She checked Carl's social media.

Finally, she found a clue.

Carl had posted about a successful collaboration with the Cavendish Corporation. Christina checked the other new partners and found the same pattern.

The realization made Christina laugh in frustration.

She muttered to herself, "I knew it. How could I be so lucky? How could such good fortune just fall into my lap?"

Her first instinct was to cancel the collaborations.

She went to her study, phone in hand, ready to call the partners. But then she paused.

###chapter 218 Parent-Child Sports Day

Yes, she hesitated.

Opportunities like this were something she had always longed for, and now that it was within her grasp, was she really going to let it slip away?

Even though it was because of William that she got this chance, they could indeed help her studio grow quickly.

With these collaborations, it would be easier to land bigger projects in the future.

In the end, Christina couldn't bring herself to make those calls.

Frustrated, she ruffled her hair and went back to bed to sleep with her child.

Meanwhile, William was listening to his assistant's report, his brow furrowed deeply.

"Are their projects really this simple?"

He was referring to the people at the dinner table that day.

He had promised them an opportunity, and now he was reviewing their contracts.

The first one was decent and had already been signed, but the subsequent ones were of poor quality. The company had been too busy to deal with them until now.

"They said if you're not satisfied, they can revise it."

The assistant spoke cautiously, "And they also mentioned they've done what they were supposed to, so they hope Mr. Cavendish won't be disappointed."

"Are they threatening me? Remind them that I didn't ask for their help, and they shouldn't use non-existent matters to threaten me. I won't collaborate on unsuitable projects, no matter who it is."

"Yes, sir." The assistant was about to leave when William's voice stopped him again. "By the way, after you send those messages, you can call it a day. It's getting late."

"Thank you, Mr. Cavendish. You should head home early too."

After the assistant left, William rubbed his temples wearily and opened his computer to check on Christina's studio.

To be honest, Christina alone couldn't compete with the other companies.

William discreetly leaked some of their previous work anonymously.

This indirectly boosted Christina's studio's capabilities.

In the past, he would have made sure everyone knew it was his doing.

But knowing Christina, she would resist if she found out he was behind it.

So he had to do it anonymously.

He glanced at Christina's social media profile one last time before shutting down his computer.

As he grabbed his coat and stepped out of his office, his phone rang with a call from a friend.

"Are you busy the day after tomorrow?"

"What's up?"

Hearing his friend's voice, William had a feeling it wasn't anything good.

"Well, I have to go on a business trip, and my wife has an emergency. Can you take my son to his school sports day?"

William raised an eyebrow. "A sports day for kindergarten? Are you using me as your free babysitter?"

"Don't worry, if you help me this time, I'll be there for you whenever you need me."

William pretended to refuse, but he found the kid quite adorable. Plus, the mention of the sports day made him think of Christina.

He wondered if Christina would be there too.

"Alright, but you owe me one." His tone turned lazy at the thought.

"You agreed?" His friend sounded surprised, half-jokingly adding, "I thought I'd have to offer more conditions."

"I didn't say I wouldn't ask for conditions. We'll discuss them later. I'm hanging up now."

Thinking about the sports day, his mood improved significantly.

The next day, he was unusually pleasant during meetings.

After the meeting, his employees exchanged puzzled glances and whispered among themselves once he left.

"What's gotten into Mr. Cavendish?"

"No idea, but it must be something really good."

"Yeah, he's been in such a foul mood lately, even the best proposals weren't good enough for him."

"But today, he actually told us to take our time and think things over. It's unbelievable."

"Totally."

"What are you guys talking about?"

William had rushed out and forgotten his phone, overhearing their conversation as he returned.

Everyone quickly shook their heads. "Nothing, Mr. Cavendish. We were discussing the proposal."

"No rush, just have it ready by Monday. Don't be as hasty as before."

His tone remained calm, and everyone was stunned by his gentleness. It wasn't until he left that they realized they hadn't responded to him.

But it didn't seem to matter much now.

Christina had just finished a meeting and returned to her office when her phone chimed.

It was a message from the teacher in the class group chat.

The school was hosting a parent-child sports day tomorrow.

If possible, both parents were encouraged to attend and create wonderful childhood memories for their kids.

Reading the message, Christina fell into deep thought.

She decided to finish her work today and take a day off tomorrow.

After sketching out her designs, she handed them to her team for final touches.

"Finish these details tomorrow. I won't be coming in, and you can leave early once you're done. No need to work late."

She had announced this in the meeting earlier, surprising but pleasing everyone.

Given the current situation, their studio had a bright future.

They had secured many collaborations and even found new directions and ideas.

Christina picked up Harper from school as usual.

"Mom, are you coming to the sports day with me tomorrow?"

On the way home, Harper's sweet voice came from the back seat.

"Of course."

That evening, they had dinner, read stories, and went to bed late.

"I don't want to wear this. I want to wear the same color as Mom."

In the end, they chose matching outfits before bed.

The next morning, Christina let Harper sleep in.

They arrived at the kindergarten, laughing, at around 9:30.

At the entrance, Harper greeted her friends.

The sports day started with preparations and introductions, creating a lively atmosphere.

After Harper finished greeting her friends, Christina took her to the field and found a seat.

But the seats were too close together.

As Christina pulled out a chair, she accidentally bumped into the person behind her.

She turned to apologize.

"Sorry, did I bump into you?" She found herself staring into familiar eyes.

William's deep voice responded.

"No worries, you didn't."

Christina didn't say anything, feeling rather unlucky.

"Oh, Tobias, you're sitting here too!"

Harper, hearing Christina greet someone, turned around.

She greeted Tobias, who was sitting next to William.

"Harper, the cookies you gave me yesterday were delicious. Next time, I'll treat you to something, and Dad Cavendish will buy it for me."

Children's friendships were simple, and they had met through a snack exchange.

"Sure, my mom made those cookies. They were really good."

Their conversation made Christina feel very awkward.

###chapter 219  Inquiry

What kind of situation is this?

William's intense gaze never left Harper.

When Christina noticed, she quickly stepped in to block his view.

The teacher finished explaining the rules and announced the start of the event.

Parents and kids began to enter the field.

Even though it was Christina's first time at a parent-child sports day, she wanted Harper to have a memorable childhood, so she gave it her all.

But some activities were tough for Christina.

Meanwhile, William seemed to breeze through everything with his child.

Christina stomped her foot in frustration.

"Mom, don't be upset. I'll work hard with you," Harper said softly, sensing her frustration. "But why don't I have a dad to help? If I had a dad, you wouldn't have to work so hard."

Harper's words made Christina swallow her bitterness.

"No, sweetie, I just had a cramp in my leg. Let's give it our all and win the championship."

As soon as Christina looked away, William's gaze returned.

"Dad Cavendish, do you like Harper's mom?" Tobias asked mischievously, looking up at William. "But that's not right. Dad says you can't like someone who's already married."

"You little rascal, what are you talking about?" William playfully poked Tobias's nose.

"Do you even know what it means to like someone?"

"No, but I think liking someone means sharing your favorite snacks with them."

William was momentarily speechless at Tobias's innocent response.

Children's feelings are indeed pure, unlike the complicated emotions of adults. They speak their minds and wear their hearts on their sleeves.

"Alright, let's move on to the next event."

The morning's sports day was intense. Despite Christina's best efforts, she and Harper only managed to secure second place.

Harper was thrilled, running around Christina with a small bronze medal.

"Mom, this medal is so pretty!"

"I'm glad you like it."

"You always said that if I liked something, you'd do your best to get it for me."

"Thank you all for participating in our kindergarten's parent-child sports day. The afternoon session will be free activities. The school has provided picnic areas and food, so feel free to team up and head to the nearby park for a picnic."

After the teacher explained the afternoon activities, the parents began to greet each other and form groups.

Christina hadn't had a chance to find a group yet when Harper pulled Tobias over from somewhere.

Naturally, William followed the children, making things awkward for the two adults.

But the kids seemed to be having a great time.

"I know you have issues with me, but there's no need to act like this in front of the kids," William said.

Christina didn't respond, but seeing the children so happy, she couldn't bring herself to object to Harper's actions.

Christina usually bought some snacks when she picked up Harper from school. She had planned to skip it today because of the sports day and take Harper out afterward.

But due to this unexpected turn of events, Christina decided to call the store and have the snacks delivered.

The park next to the school was large, and with Harper and Tobias dawdling, and various interruptions, by the time they arrived, only a spot by the river was left.

"Isn't this a bit unsafe?" Christina asked, eyeing the river nervously.

"It'll be fine. We'll keep an eye on them," William reassured her, noticing her concern.

Christina didn't say anything more. She spread out the picnic blanket, and the snacks she had ordered were delivered.

The school had only provided some fruit and snacks. The combination of the ordered snacks and the school's fruit looked quite appealing.

Other parents hadn't prepared as much. They were just interacting and chatting with their children nearby.

The kids, freed from the confines of the classroom, were having a blast on the lawn. Even the usually reserved Harper became lively.

Seeing this, Christina felt particularly happy.

The two children took their snacks and fruit to share with other kids.

This left William and Christina alone.

They sat on opposite sides of the blanket. William tried to move closer, but Christina would pull away each time.

"You don't have to be like this. We're not at that point yet."

"It's not that. I just think there's no need to be so cold," William said with a hint of helplessness. "Let's put our issues aside for now and focus on the kids."

Christina didn't respond, her eyes fixed on Harper.

William had a question that had been bothering him, but he couldn't find the right moment to ask.

Just then, a parent suggested having the kids play a game and take a group photo as a keepsake for when they grow up.

Christina had no objections, leaving it up to Harper.

As Tobias's parent, William also had no objections.

The kids gathered to play an old game of Duck, Duck, Goose, organized by the parents.

But young children often lack balance, and some would veer off course while running.

When it was Harper's turn, the child who had thrown the beanbag earlier accidentally ran off course.

By the time everyone realized something was wrong, Harper had already reached the edge of the railing.

Christina and William both looked over in alarm, but before Christina could say anything, Harper tripped over the railing and fell.

Christina rushed over, but before she could speak, William had already kicked off his shoes and jumped in.

The other parents, shocked by the situation, quickly gathered their children.

Fortunately, the river in the park wasn't deep. William quickly pulled Harper out.

"Harper, are you okay?"

Christina took Harper from William and administered first aid. Another parent offered a coat, and she wrapped Harper up and took him to the school nurse for a check-up.

While waiting for the check-up, Christina remembered William, who had saved Harper.

"Thank you."

William was a bit surprised. Although the teacher had given him a towel to dry off, he still looked a bit disheveled.

Looking at the small figure in the nurse's office, William recalled how Harper had clung to his shirt underwater.

He couldn't hold back any longer and asked the question that had been on his mind.

"Is Harper my child?"

Christina looked at him as if he were crazy. "Does it matter?"

"It does." Despite Christina's displeased expression, William's tone remained serious.

"So what if he is? Are you planning to take him away from me?"

Christina's voice carried a hint of sarcasm. Just then, the school nurse announced that the check-up was complete, and Christina quickly ran into the nurse's office.

###chapter 220  Mom Takes You Back

Harper was startled and immediately jumped into her mother's arms.

"Mommy..."

"I'm right here, sweetie," Christina said, holding her child tightly.

William stood at the doorway, watching the heartwarming scene unfold. He knew he couldn't be too stern.

Seeing them happy was enough for him.

"Thanks, Dad Cavendish!" Harper saw him and beamed.

William walked over and scooped Harper up in his arms.

"Hey, be careful near the water from now on, okay?"

Harper nodded enthusiastically.

Christina stood up. "Alright, let's get you home."

William, eager to help, stepped forward.

"Let me drive you."

"No need," Christina replied coolly, taking Harper's small hand and quickly walking out.

William looked at his empty hand, feeling a sense of loss.

After Christina got home, she received a call from Kaitlyn.

On the other end, Kaitlyn was sobbing uncontrollably.

"Christina, can you... can you come see me?"

"What's wrong?" Christina could tell something was very wrong and felt worried.

"Come see me, I'll tell you in person," Kaitlyn choked out.

Christina agreed.

After settling Harper, she rushed to Kaitlyn's house.

The door was unlocked, and she pushed it open to go inside.

The room was a mess, like a battle had taken place. Everything was thrown on the floor, glass shards everywhere, making it hard to find a place to step.

Kaitlyn was barefoot, sitting on the living room floor, crying.

Christina quickly walked over.

"Did you two have a fight?"

Marriage might just be a mess, she thought. It started sweet, but for the past six months, Kaitlyn often cried to her about Stanley's constant arguments.

She tried to understand Stanley's work stress, but he was indifferent!

Kaitlyn threw herself into Christina's arms, clinging to her neck and crying.

"Christina, do you think I brought this on myself?"

Christina gently hugged her, offering comfort. "Of course not, how could it be your fault?"

Kaitlyn cried even harder.

"I chased him for so long, gave everything to be with him, and now he doesn't appreciate me. He wanted to marry me after coming back from Eldoria, but why? Why do men's feelings always change?"

Christina didn't know what to say.

She understood this all too well.

"Kaitlyn, don't be sad. There's nothing that can't be talked through between a couple. The seven-year itch is tough, but you can sit down and have a good talk."

"Talk about what? It's not even seven years, and he's already betrayed me. He said I'm not as gentle and understanding as that other woman. Didn't he know I have a fiery temper? Why does he think I'm not as good as someone else?"

Kaitlyn's emotions flared up again. After shouting, she broke down into heart-wrenching sobs.

What?

Christina hadn't realized it was this serious.

Stanley, who seemed so dedicated to his construction business, had changed. His company had grown significantly in the past two years. Who would have thought he could betray her?

"Are you sure?"

Kaitlyn nodded, tears streaming down her face. "I saw him go into a hotel with that woman, so I confronted him. He admitted it. Christina, what should I do?"

Christina looked around at the wreckage, feeling a chill in her heart.

"Did he break all this?"

"Yes, he even tried to hit me." Kaitlyn's sadness deepened, and she cried on Christina's shoulder.

Christina couldn't believe it had come to this. Stanley, of all people, betraying his relationship?

She looked at Kaitlyn with determination. "Kaitlyn, you need to pull yourself together. Divorce him."

Kaitlyn's tears flowed like a river. "I don't want to divorce him, I really don't. I love him so much, but I know we can't go back. Why do feelings change so easily in this world? Is it something I did wrong? If I change, will he come back?"

Christina steadied her, looking into her eyes. "It's not you. You've done enough. You are who you are, Kaitlyn. Someone who truly loves you won't reject you for being yourself. If they do, they never loved you enough."

Kaitlyn sobbed uncontrollably. Her emotions were so intense that she clutched her stomach in pain, sitting by the couch, gasping for air.

Christina sensed something was wrong. "What's wrong?"

"My stomach hurts," Kaitlyn said, unable to lift her head.

Christina looked down and saw a sudden flow of blood between Kaitlyn's legs. "You're pregnant, didn't you know?"

"I... I didn't know," Kaitlyn said, shaking her head in confusion. Seeing the blood, she gasped. "The baby, the baby."

Christina didn't waste any time and called an ambulance.

As Kaitlyn was being taken to the ambulance, she clung to Christina's hand. "Tell Stanley."

After all the destruction Stanley caused, Christina didn't want him near Kaitlyn. But seeing the desperate, hopeful look in Kaitlyn's eyes, she reluctantly picked up her phone and called him.

When he answered, Stanley's voice was filled with irritation. "Can't you leave me alone? I told you, we're done. Stop chasing me, okay? I need space!"

"Hey, Kaitlyn's in trouble," Christina said, trying to keep her anger in check.

But before she could finish, he hung up.

"Hello? Hello!" She was furious. When she tried calling again, his phone was off. Blocked or turned off, she couldn't tell.

Kaitlyn, hearing this, looked at her with despair. "Why... ah!" She screamed and passed out from the pain.

In the ambulance, the nurses were frantic. "The patient is hemorrhaging."

Christina was desperate. "Please, save her!"

"Don't worry, we'll do our best," a nurse assured her.

A few minutes later, they arrived at the hospital, and Kaitlyn was rushed into the emergency room.

The light above the operating room stayed on, filling Christina with anxiety. She tried calling Stanley again with her own phone, but it wouldn't go through.

She was so angry she wanted to smash her phone. How could Stanley have changed so much?

###chapter 221  Do You Really Have to Be So Heartless?

After what felt like an eternity, the light in the operating room finally went out.

Christina rushed to the door, her heart pounding. As soon as the nurse stepped out, she blurted, "How is she?"

The nurse's voice was gentle but somber, "The baby didn't make it, but she's going to be okay."

Christina let out a breath she didn't realize she was holding. "Thank God," she whispered.

Once Kaitlyn was moved to a regular room, Christina went in to see her.

Kaitlyn was already awake, staring blankly out the window. The weather outside was beautiful, with birds flying by.

Christina sighed, quickly walked over, and sat by her side, tucking her in.

Before she could say anything, Kaitlyn forced a bitter smile, "Maybe it's for the best. In this messed-up marriage, what kind of life could a child have? I wouldn't want a kid to be stuck in this."

Christina was taken aback by her clarity.

Kaitlyn turned her head, "Back then, I used my passion to tie him down, pushing him to marry me. Maybe he never even figured out if it was love or just being used to having me around."

Christina tried to comfort her, "Don't think about that now. Just rest."

Kaitlyn shook her head.

"I was on the brink of death just now, and everything flashed through my mind. I think I've figured it all out, Christina. I want a divorce."

Christina didn't expect her to decide so quickly but still asked, "Are you sure?"

Kaitlyn nodded firmly, "Yes, I'm sure."

"Alright," Christina responded softly, "Since you're sure, I'll help you."

The most important thing now was to gather evidence, everything that would help Kaitlyn in the divorce.

Finding evidence of Stanley's infidelity wasn't hard.

Stanley's lover was right in the company, even his secretary, a very beautiful woman. Their close interactions naturally led to an affair.

Moreover, people in the company had heard rumors.

Christina gathered all this information.

After a few days of rest, Kaitlyn was ready to be discharged, and Christina came to pick her up.

"I've gathered a lot of evidence and consulted a lawyer. It'll be very beneficial for your divorce."

Kaitlyn lowered her head in thought, then after a long pause, she said quietly, "Okay, I understand."

Christina spoke seriously, "Also, when Stanley started the company, Kelvin supported him a lot. This can be considered pre-marital assets, and we can make sure he ends up with nothing."

Kaitlyn nodded and took a deep breath.

"Thank you for helping me so much."

Christina smiled, "No need to thank me. You're my friend, after all."

"Am I too weak, Christina?" Kaitlyn looked up, "Too weak to face all this on my own."

Christina laughed and looked at her seriously, "Not at all. I've always admired you. You say what you want to say, do what you want to do, without worrying about the consequences. You always keep a sincere heart towards life, and that's rare!"

"Are you calling me foolish?" Kaitlyn lowered her head and gave a bitter smile.

"No, never. Don't ever punish yourself for someone else's mistakes," Christina said earnestly.

Kaitlyn took a deep breath, "I understand."

People's hearts change, and she wouldn't force it anymore.

When Stanley first got the court summons, he just shrugged it off, still holding his secretary close.

The secretary snuggled into his arms, "Are you sure this is okay? I heard your company was funded by her family. What if..."

"She's just trying to scare me into coming back. Don't worry about it," Stanley said, taking a deep drag of his cigarette.

The secretary coyly lay on his chest.

"When I first met you, you were so naive, head over heels for your wife, and wouldn't budge no matter what."

Stanley, feeling aroused, stubbed out his cigarette.

"Back then, I was all about architecture, hadn't seen the world's luxuries. Later, I realized how much fun the rich have. The money we earn with so much effort is just a drop in the bucket. Staying up late working on designs can't compare to enjoying life."

He turned over, pinning the secretary beneath him.

"Come on, let's keep going!"

The secretary giggled, "You still got energy?"

Stanley kissed her hard on the face, "Don't underestimate me."

He grabbed her hand, ready to continue, when his phone suddenly rang.

Annoyed, he grabbed the phone and answered it.

"What is it? Didn't I say not to bother me after work?"

The voice on the other end was urgent, "The Fisher family is here. They're taking back the company's management rights and auditing the accounts."

"What?" Stanley sat up straight, "Why so suddenly?"

"Come back quickly. We can't hold them off," the voice said before hanging up.

The secretary also got up from the bed, "What's wrong? Are we continuing?"

Stanley hurriedly dressed, "Continue what?"

When he rushed to the company, the Fisher family's people were already there with lawyers, taking over everything.

"You can't do this. I've been running the company for years."

"Really? Without our initial investment, you wouldn't have this scale. Don't worry, you'll get what's yours. The profits you've made over the years are marital assets, and I don't plan to take them. The law will give a fair judgment."

With that, the Fisher family's people left.

The company was now completely out of his hands.

Furious, Stanley called Kaitlyn.

At that moment, Kaitlyn was packing her things with Christina's help. Seeing the familiar number, she smiled faintly and answered.

"What's up?"

Stanley gritted his teeth, "You're ruthless."

Kaitlyn thought he would angrily berate her, but he sounded eerily calm.

"Not as ruthless as you. I thought we could have a stable life, a happy family, and welcome a new life. But you destroyed it all. Since you don't want me, how can you still want what I brought you?"

"You!" Stanley knew he was in the wrong, so he softened his tone, "I've been running the company for years. You didn't contribute much. How can you take it back? I'll repay the initial investment. The company must be mine."

"So that's what you wanted to say," Kaitlyn laughed lightly, "No need. I don't want to settle privately. Let's wait for the court."

"Do you really have to be so heartless?" Stanley questioned.

"You were heartless first!" Kaitlyn chuckled, "See you in court."

With that, she hung up.

###chapter 222  Let's Be Respectful to Each Other

People's hearts are made of flesh. Over the years, Kaitlyn had loved Stanley deeply. She never imagined that one day they would reach a point where they couldn't stand each other and were locked in a bitter struggle.

Time really can change everything.

After hanging up the phone, her heart ached terribly.

By now, there was no talk of love between them, only disputes over money and interests.

Maybe from the beginning, it was all just her wishful thinking. Such a flawed love couldn't last.

She pulled some strings, and the court date came quickly.

Divorce cases involving property division are always tough. After a round of debates, Kaitlyn was exhausted.

Christina came to pick her up. "How'd it go?"

"Do you think I used to see him through rose-colored glasses? He was always so dull and so eager for quick success, but I thought he was the best in the world. Watching him hurl insults at me in court was just laughable," Kaitlyn said with a bitter smile.

Christina sighed softly. "You've grown a lot."

But sometimes, growth comes at a price.

Kaitlyn leaned on her shoulder. "If all goes well, it should be settled by the end of the year. I want to travel then, Christina. Will you come with me?"

Christina gently patted her back. "Where to?"

Kaitlyn thought for a moment. "The Maldives, Hawaii? Anywhere with a beach!"

Christina chuckled. "That's pretty far. If it's abroad, I might not be able to join you."

Kaitlyn raised an eyebrow. "Because of your daughter?"

"Yeah," Christina shrugged.

Kaitlyn didn't mind. "Just bring her along! The three of us, a girls' trip, it would be fun."

Christina sighed again, unable to give a definite answer. "We'll see. Plans can change."

"Alright, if you can't come, I'll find another friend," Kaitlyn said with a bright smile.

She seemed to be naturally warm and energetic, always able to uplift others.

"Who would you ask?" Christina asked with a smile.

"Definitely not a guy. I'm done with men," Kaitlyn sighed deeply. "I have a long life ahead, and I just want to experience everything."

As they spoke, Stanley came down the steps.

Seeing Christina, his expression was a bit nostalgic. She had been his first crush in his youth.

Kaitlyn knew he was there but didn't turn around. Instead, she warmly linked arms with Christina.

"Christina, let's go."

With everything settled, Christina was ready to leave when Stanley suddenly called out to them.

"Kaitlyn, Christina."

They both turned around.

Christina protectively placed Kaitlyn behind her, giving Stanley a wary look. "What is it?"

Stanley took a deep breath and walked over quickly. "Kaitlyn, do you want to reconsider the divorce?"

"You're not trying to keep me because of me. You're worried about losing the company. Stanley, let's just settle the accounts. I don't want to say more," Kaitlyn said, exhausted, waving her hand dismissively.

Stanley pressed his lips together. "These days have been a blur. This month, because of our divorce, I've calmed down and thought things through. I feel like I've found myself again."

Kaitlyn couldn't help but laugh. "I gave you a chance. Thank you for hurting me so deeply; it gave me the chance to be reborn. Let's keep things dignified. Don't make me think you're still irresponsible."

Stanley opened his mouth but couldn't say a word.

Kaitlyn grabbed Christina's hand. "Let's go."

On the way back, Christina picked up Harper.

"Did you have fun at preschool today?"

Harper, eager to share, said happily, "We built with blocks today. Mine was the tallest and steadiest. The teacher praised me!"

"Harper is so excellent. How should Mommy reward you?" Christina pinched her chubby cheek.

Harper giggled. "I want Mommy's homemade shrimp."

"Alright, we'll go to the store and get some," Christina agreed.

"Oh, and Mommy, the teacher said we need to make a pretty lantern. Can we buy the materials?" Harper asked hopefully.

"Of course!" Christina agreed.

There was a large supermarket near their apartment. Christina picked a cart with a seat for Harper.

Harper sat in the cart, spreading her little arms and laughing. "Faster, Mommy, faster!"

"Alright, for Harper, Mommy can go faster," Christina said indulgently, pushing the cart through the aisles.

Suddenly, a man appeared in front of them. She almost couldn't stop in time and nearly collided with him.

To her surprise, the man reacted quickly, stopping the cart.

Harper, a bit startled, saw the man and excitedly opened her arms. "Dad Cavendish!"

It was William.

Christina raised an eyebrow. "What are you doing here?"

"As you can see, buying some things," William said, pointing to the items in his hand.

Christina smirked. "Didn't expect you to be so considerate, buying sanitary pads for your girlfriend."

William looked down and realized he had grabbed a pack of night-use pads without noticing. He blushed, stammering to explain, while Harper giggled and hugged him.

"Dad Cavendish is so nice. I see lots of men who won't buy these for their wives."

"Don't say that," William said, pinching her chubby cheek.

"I'm not lying," Harper pouted.

Christina took Harper back. "You shouldn't jump into his arms like that."

"Why not? Dad Cavendish is my hero," Harper said, snuggling into William's arms.

William felt his heart melt.

The child was soft, innocent, and sweet, just like a mini version of Christina, even more adorable.

Harper grabbed his hand. "Dad Cavendish, can we shop together?"

###chapter 223 We Are as Happy as They Are

William glanced at Christina and smiled, nodding. "Sure thing."

Before Christina could say anything, they were already getting ready to head to the grocery store together.

Christina noticed how much Harper cared about this, so she didn't say much. But deep down, she felt that meeting William here wasn't just a coincidence.

"Planning to cook at home?" William asked, noticing the amount of groceries she was buying.

"Yeah," Christina replied with a faint smile. "When we were abroad, Harper wasn't used to the food there, so I always cooked for her. She's gotten used to my cooking."

"Mom's cooking is the best! Dad Cavendish, do you want to try it?" Harper asked with hopeful eyes.

Before William could respond, Christina quickly interjected.

"Sorry, she's just being a kid. It's not really convenient."

William felt a pang of disappointment but managed a smile. "No problem!"

Harper looked at her mom, puzzled. Back when they were abroad, many friends would come over, and her mom was always welcoming. What had changed? But she didn't dare ask.

With their shopping almost done, Christina headed to the checkout, while William carried Harper, trailing behind.

A young couple nearby was also shopping. They glanced over with envy. The girl said to the boy, "Do you think we'll be as happy as them when we get married?"

The boy earnestly promised, "We definitely will."

The girl blushed and looked down shyly.

"And we'll have a cute daughter like that?"

"We will. When we have kids, I'll hold your hand and our child's hand, and we'll watch the sunset together," the boy said wistfully.

Christina overheard their conversation and felt the urge to clarify that they weren't a family. But seeing their happiness, she decided against it. A stranger's words wouldn't change anything.

However, William felt a strange emotion stirring inside him. Was there still a chance for them?

At the checkout, William pulled out his card to pay.

Christina quickly took it from him. "Mr. Cavendish, there's no need for this. We're not that close. You don't need to pay for us."

She handed her card to the cashier and said, "We're done here. If there's nothing else, I'll take Harper home."

Harper's eyes sparkled with an idea. She tugged on William's arm.

"Mom, Dad Cavendish looks like he's good at crafts. I can't make the lantern. Can he help me?"

"Harper, you should do your own tasks. Don't trouble others. I'll help you find a tutorial when we get home," Christina said, patting her head.

Harper pouted. "Okay."

But as they left, William persisted.

"Do you live nearby? I can give you a ride."

"No need," Christina replied curtly. "It's just a short walk. Besides, giving my address to a stranger isn't safe."

William felt a pang of sadness but couldn't argue.

As they parted, Harper waved goodbye, looking reluctant.

"Goodbye, Dad Cavendish."

Christina said nothing. After William left, she smiled and asked, "You've only met him a few times. Why do you like him so much? I'm getting jealous."

Harper quickly responded, "Mom, you're the most important person in the world to me. But Dad Cavendish saved me. He's a hero, and I like heroes."

Christina's eyes darkened.

William, a man who had hurt children, was now seen as a hero by her daughter? Life was truly unpredictable.

"But remember, we need boundaries. Dad Cavendish is still an outsider to us," Christina said seriously.

Harper bit her lip. "Mom, I really wish I had a dad."

"But you can't just pick any dad," Christina said, patting her head. "He bought sanitary pads for his girlfriend, which means he has a family. It's wrong to interfere in someone else's relationship."

Harper nodded firmly. "Okay, I understand."

Christina sighed in relief. Sometimes, kids were easy to placate.

Back home, she made Harper's favorite dish, garlic butter shrimp. Harper took a picture before happily digging in.

After dinner, it was time for some mother-daughter bonding.

Christina, who used to be an architect, was skilled with her hands. Together, they made a red paper lantern with a small light inside, using a bamboo stick to hold it up. It took time, but it turned out beautifully.

Harper clapped her hands. "Mom, you finished it so quickly! The teacher said it's due next Monday, but it's so pretty, I want to show it off at school."

"Alright, but it's late. Time for bed," Christina said, patting her head. It was already past nine, and Harper needed her sleep.

William returned home, deep in thought.

He couldn't figure out a way to get closer to Christina. After everything that had happened, he didn't want to push her away again.

After much contemplation, he called a friend.

"About your kid..."

His friend chuckled. "My kid's a handful. Didn't give you too much trouble, did he?"

But William wasn't concerned about that. "No, he's great. I was wondering if there are any more activities at the preschool that I could help with."

His friend sensed something. "Hey, Mr. Cavendish, you used to avoid kids. What's changed?"

William smiled. "Maybe I'm getting older. I never really spent time with kids before, but now I find them adorable."

"Come on, be honest," his friend said. "What's your real motive?"

William sighed. "I just want to know what activities the preschool has coming up."

###chapter 224  Uncle Helps You Make Lanterns

"Hey, come on, you've been a parent for years and now you're suddenly interested in a parent-teacher meeting? Did you fall for one of the kids' parents or maybe the teacher?" William's friend teased, clearly amused.

William scratched his head, looking a bit troubled. "It's not that. Just tell me, okay? Consider it a favor I owe you."

"No way, man. It's not every day you need something from me. I gotta milk this for all it's worth," his friend laughed heartily.

"Forget it, I'll ask someone else," William said, losing patience. It was just a kindergarten thing, no need to let his friend hold it over him.

His friend, however, got anxious. "Wait, fine, I'll tell you. They're making lanterns soon, and there's a parent-child outing coming up. They announced it a while ago. Hey, are you planning to go? I could lend you my son."

William thought for a moment. "Alright, we'll see about the outing." As for making lanterns, he wasn't much help there. Christina used to be an architect; making these things would be a piece of cake for her. Asking his friend turned out to be pointless.

His friend, with a mysterious look, said, "Show me the woman you're interested in. I want to see who's finally caught your eye after all these years."

The sound of children playing could be heard in the background. William quickly found an excuse, "You're happy with your family, so don't bother me. Go spend time with your son." With that, he hung up the phone. His friend was left fuming but couldn't do anything about it.

The next day, Harper brought the lantern to school, and it immediately drew the admiration of her classmates.

"Wow, it's so pretty! Your mom is really talented."

"Yeah, my mom did most of it, but I cut out this little window. Isn't it nice?" Harper proudly showed off the lantern.

"It's beautiful."

"Let me see it."

The kids started arguing over it. In the midst of the commotion, the lantern was passed around several times. Harper, worried it might get damaged, quickly said, "Give it back to me, now!"

"Don't be so stingy. It's so well-made, we just want to see how it's done," several kids chimed in.

Just then, with a thud, the lantern fell to the ground. Harper rushed to pick it up, but in the pushing and shoving, two kids lost their balance and fell. The delicate lantern was crushed instantly. Harper tried to fix it but found the paper was creased and couldn't be restored. She felt a wave of frustration. She and her mom had worked hard on it all night.

The kids, realizing their mistake, apologized, "Sorry, Harper, we didn't mean to."

Harper, being generous, forced a smile. "It's okay." But she was still upset. Her mood remained sour for the rest of the day.

William, waiting in the car, spotted Harper standing at the kindergarten gate, looking forlorn. He waved her over.

"Harper."

Harper looked up, her small face full of sadness.

William got out of the car and gently pinched her cheek. "What happened? Who made my Harper upset? Tell Dad Cavendish, and I'll take care of it."

"No need," Harper pouted. "The lantern Mom and I made got ruined by my classmates, and now I can't turn in my assignment next week."

"Is that all? How about Dad Cavendish helps you make a new one?" William offered eagerly, seizing the opportunity.

Harper's eyes lit up. "Really?"

"Of course," William said, patting her head. "Looks like your mom isn't here yet. I'll have the driver get some materials, and we can make it in the classroom."

"Okay," Harper nodded.

The materials were quickly bought. The school had strict rules, so William couldn't take Harper out, but the teacher recognized him and allowed them to stay in the classroom.

William cut the colorful paper and glued it together. He chose a remote-controlled color-changing bulb for the lantern. But when he turned it on, his face fell. The paper was too thick; the light couldn't shine through.

Harper rested her head on her hand, "Dad Cavendish, this isn't as nice as Mom's."

William smiled awkwardly. "No worries, it's not finished yet. I'll fix it."

He started cutting patterns into the thick paper, hoping to let the light through. But his cuts were uneven and messy, making the lantern look worse.

Harper couldn't help but laugh. "So, there are things Dad Cavendish can't do."

"No problem, if it's ugly, we'll start over," William said, determined, grabbing more paper.

Before he could start, the teacher's voice came from outside. "Harper's mom, you're here."

Christina's voice was gentle, "Sorry I'm late, I had something to do. Hope it didn't cause you any trouble."

"No trouble at all. Someone's been keeping Harper company, so I got to finish my report," the teacher said, leading her in.

Christina wondered who was with Harper, but her face darkened when she saw William. "What are you doing here?"

"I..." William quickly made up an excuse, "Just asking about school activities for a friend."

Really? Christina was skeptical.

Harper, however, was happy, "Mom, Dad Cavendish is helping me make a lantern."

Christina gently patted her head, "Didn't I already make one for you?"

"It got ruined by my classmates," Harper said, looking down.

"Do you want the one he made?" Christina glanced at the crooked lantern.

Honestly, Harper wasn't impressed. "Mom, can you make me a new one?"

William felt a bit embarrassed.

Christina, pleased, ruffled Harper's hair, "Of course, Mom will make you a new one."

William gritted his teeth. Winning over a child wasn't easy, but he was up for the challenge.

As Christina and Harper left, William caught up, "Let me give you a ride."

Christina turned and smiled faintly, "No need, I have my car."

###chapter 225  There Is No "If" in Life

To make it easier to pick up Harper, she had everything ready well in advance.

William was flat-out rejected.

He knew Christina was stubborn and unyielding, and now he was at a loss for what to do. He let out a heavy sigh.

Christina couldn't be bothered with him and left with the child.

After making a new lantern for the child that evening, Kaitlyn called her.

"Hey, Christina, got a minute?"

Her voice sounded cheerful, almost like her old self.

Christina smiled helplessly. "What's up?"

Kaitlyn sighed. "Well, my grandpa heard you were back and invited you over. We're also hosting a party soon, and we thought it would be a good chance to catch up."

Even though she was no longer in the architecture institute, she would never forget the mentorship she received.

Christina agreed immediately. "Sure."

Kaitlyn sounded mysterious. "Make sure you dress nicely. My grandpa knows a lot of talented young architects. I'll introduce you to a handsome one, guaranteed to make you happy."

Christina sighed. "Don't bother with that. Haven't you learned your lesson? I'm not interested in that right now. I just want to focus on raising my child and living a peaceful life."

"How can you say that? Hasn't your child ever asked about their dad?"

Christina sighed heavily at the mention of this topic.

Even though they had been on opposite sides of the ocean for years, they still kept in touch. Christina had never told Kaitlyn about this, but she had somehow guessed Harper's thoughts.

Sensing her silence, Kaitlyn continued, "Don't worry. You're still young and beautiful, and your child is so well-behaved and adorable. Finding a good husband won't be hard."

Christina didn't want to dwell on this.

"Enough. Don't worry about me. I think Mr. Fisher is hosting this party to help you find a good husband now that you're newly divorced. You should focus on yourself."

"I just got divorced, and you want me to find someone new? No way." Kaitlyn pouted.

Christina joked, "Let's see if you can avoid it."

Kaitlyn sighed.

The party was at the Fisher family home.

She hadn't been back in years, and everything was just as she remembered.

Kelvin was getting old. He had stopped taking on students in recent years. Those from the architecture institute either moved to other companies or started their own businesses.

He had helped many students over the years, putting in a lot of effort, and it had taken a toll on him.

When he saw Christina, his eyes lit up.

"You haven't been back in so many years."

Christina lowered her head. "I'm sorry, Mr. Fisher. I left in such a hurry back then."

"You were one of my best students. How have you been abroad?" Kelvin asked with a smile.

"Couldn't make it, so I came back." Christina joked.

Kelvin didn't buy it. "You, who could win a gold medal with your work, couldn't make it? You're just trying to fool me."

Christina looked guilty. "Mr. Fisher, I wanted to come see you right away, but I had so much to do. It took me a while."

"It's enough that you thought of me." Kelvin patted her shoulder. "Come visit often now that you're back. Liven up the place."

Christina nodded firmly. "I will."

As they spoke, Kaitlyn, in a flowing white dress, walked over quickly.

"I was looking for you. Didn't expect you to be chatting with my grandpa."

"It's been so long since I visited Mr. Fisher. I had to take this chance." Christina smiled.

Kaitlyn pulled her along, looking mysterious. "Come with me."

Christina had no choice but to follow. The main hall was already filled with many young talents.

Kaitlyn introduced her to them.

After a few greetings, Christina pulled Kaitlyn aside.

"Don't think I don't know what you're up to. Don't mess around."

Kaitlyn laughed. "I'm not messing around. I just thought you should meet some people in the same field now that you're back. That's not wrong, is it?"

Christina took a deep breath. "There's no rush."

"If you don't find a man to tie you down, will you leave me again?" Kaitlyn pouted. "Do you know how I've been these years? Even though we chatted online sometimes, it didn't ease my longing."

Christina almost laughed at her pouty face. "Didn't I tell you where I was? And I told you when I came back."

Kaitlyn whined, "I don't care."

Christina couldn't handle her and said seriously, "Don't worry. With you here, I won't leave."

Kaitlyn was completely amused.

As they chatted in a corner, someone suddenly greeted them. "Kaitlyn, long time no see."

Kaitlyn looked up.

"Irvin, the last time we met was..."

"At Mr. Fisher's birthday party, over six months ago. I was busy with work and only saw you briefly." Irvin smiled.

Kaitlyn slapped her forehead. "I almost forgot. The last time was at my grandpa's birthday party."

"I heard you recently got divorced." Irvin asked hesitantly.

Seeing Kaitlyn's stunned expression, Irvin quickly waved his hand. "Sorry, I didn't mean to bring up a sore subject. Just asking."

"It's normal for you to ask. You witnessed my happiness. You probably didn't expect everything to change in just a few years. Yes, it was a big deal, and I didn't plan to hide it." Kaitlyn smiled.

Looking back, she realized she had been chasing Stanley all these years.

She was tired. Maybe the one who gives in first in love always loses. After so many years of losing, she didn't want to continue.

Irvin sighed. "If I hadn't let you marry Stanley at the wedding, would things be different?"

"How could it be? We might not have worked out either." Kaitlyn laughed. "Life has no 'what ifs.' If we had married, it might have ended the same way."

###chapter 226  Who Let You In?

"Not really," Irvin shook his head, lost in thought.

He seemed to be reminiscing about the past.

Back then, he really admired Kaitlyn's fiery passion for the person she loved.

But he was a gentleman, understanding that matters of the heart were never simple. So, he was willing to step back and let Kaitlyn choose who she truly wanted.

He never imagined that after all these years, things would change so drastically.

Kaitlyn couldn't quite grasp his true intentions but felt something was off. She tilted her head and smiled, "Aren't you getting married? If Sarah hears you talking to me like this, she might not be too happy."

"Married?" Irvin laughed bitterly, "We've been dragging it out for so long that there's no love left. We're actually in the process of calling off the engagement."

"How did it come to this?" Kaitlyn sensed some juicy gossip.

Irvin sighed, "It was more of a business arrangement, really. We were both looking for benefits, but we couldn't agree. There was no love to begin with. If we hadn't invited so many people to the engagement party, it wouldn't be such a hassle to call it off."

Kaitlyn felt a bit sorry, "Marriage should be about two people in love coming together at the right time, not a business deal."

"That's why I envy you. You always have the courage to go after what you want," Irvin shook his head.

"Sometimes, being too impulsive can lead you into a bottomless pit," Kaitlyn raised her glass.

"Do you regret it?" Irvin clinked his glass with hers.

Kaitlyn took a sip, her eyes firm.

"No regrets. Every step I've taken counts. I just hope that after everything, I can still find myself. That's enough."

Irvin stared at her, admiration in his eyes.

He suddenly burst into laughter, "You're still the same as when I first met you, always passionate."

"You mean always gullible?" Kaitlyn laughed at herself.

"Of course not. Your qualities are like treasures to those who recognize them," Irvin chuckled.

Kaitlyn couldn't help but laugh out loud.

"I never thought you'd think so highly of me."

Irvin raised his glass, "To the disheartened."

"Cheers," Kaitlyn downed her drink.

Christina approached them after they finished talking, "I remember him."

"Really?" Kaitlyn leaned on her shoulder, laughing heartily, "We had a good chat. I think he's a great guy. Want me to introduce you?"

"No need," Christina smiled wryly and waved her hand.

She glanced at the time, "I need to head back."

Kaitlyn pouted, "You promised to come to the concert. It just started, and you haven't even danced yet. No way you're leaving now!"

Christina sighed.

"You'll understand when you have kids. Even though I have a babysitter, I can't help but worry about her being alone at home. Besides, Harper is very attached to me. She must be worried since she hasn't seen me for a while."

"You have a babysitter, what's there to worry about?" Kaitlyn clung to her, refusing to let go. "I don't care, you have to stay with me."

Christina sighed, giving in. "You haven't changed a bit in all these years."

Kaitlyn pouted, "A little charm goes a long way, Christina. Please stay!"

Christina couldn't refuse. "Alright, I'll stay for another half hour."

Kaitlyn's eyes sparkled. "Great, half an hour is enough."

She anxiously glanced at the door, but the person she was waiting for never showed up.

Damn it, he promised he'd be here today!

Christina couldn't stay any longer. Ever since she had a child, her heart was always with Harper. Even though she planned to stay out late, she couldn't stop worrying about Harper and the babysitter.

She made a point to check on Kelvin.

The party was long, and Kelvin was tired, already resting upstairs. She knocked and entered, and Kelvin smiled when he saw her.

"You came!"

"I noticed you weren't at the party, so I came to check on you."

Kelvin poured her a cup of coffee.

"By the way, there was something I originally assigned to Stanley, but now... never mind. It's a university lecture, and I want to recommend you as the speaker."

"Me?" Christina shook her head. "I'm not sure I'm the right fit."

"Why not? You're a renowned designer, well-respected in the architecture world. You're perfect to inspire those young students," Kelvin sighed. "It's not ideal to change speakers last minute, but please, do me this favor."

Christina didn't expect him to insist so much, so she nodded.

"Mr. Fisher, I'm just worried I might not do a good job. But alright, I'll do it!"

Kelvin smiled and handed her an invitation card.

"Here's the invitation."

"Got it!" Christina took it and glanced at the time. "It's getting late, I need to head back. Mr. Fisher, I'll take my leave now. I got you a gift from abroad, it should arrive in a couple of days!"

"You young folks, always with the gifts," Kelvin waved his hand. "I don't need anything."

"Consider it a token of my appreciation. Besides, I know you'll like it, and it's not expensive," Christina smiled.

She stood up to leave. "I'll be going now. Goodbye, Mr. Fisher."

As she left, she saw Kaitlyn chatting with Irvin again, both of them laughing heartily.

She headed home, not expecting to hear Harper's laughter and William's voice as soon as she walked in.

For a moment, she thought she was hearing things. But when she changed her shoes and walked in, she saw William playing with Harper on the living room floor.

She was stunned and walked over. "What's going on? Who let you in?"

Her tone carried a hint of anger.

How could he be so intrusive? What was he trying to do? Ruin Harper's life too?

William stood up immediately. "I saw your babysitter with Harper outside and found out you were out. So, I came to keep Harper company."

###chapter 227 You Have Crossed the Line, Mr. Cavendish

"Do you really need to tag along? Mr. Cavendish, people need to respect boundaries, and you've crossed the line," Christina said icily.

William felt a pang in his heart. "Christina."

"We're not that close, are we?" Christina wasn't buying it. She narrowed her eyes and stared at him coldly.

William took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. "I was just worried Harper might feel lonely at home by herself. Since you went out, I thought it was only right to check on her."

Christina let out a cold laugh. "Harper has a nanny, and I made sure she was fine before I left. William, what are you really after? This isn't the first time."

Harper seemed frightened by her mother's tone and started crying, wiping her tears. "I'm sorry, Mom. It's my fault. You told me not to talk to strangers, and I didn't listen. Please don't be mad at Dad Cavendish. It's all my fault."

Christina was taken aback.

She hadn't expected things to escalate like this.

If she continued to clash with William, the only one who would get hurt was the child caught in the middle, and she didn't want that.

She calmed down. "Mr. Cavendish, I'm back now. Harper doesn't need your company anymore. Please don't come here again. You're not welcome. I'll see you out."

She instructed the nanny and turned to escort William out.

Once outside, William couldn't wait to ask, "She's my daughter, isn't she?"

Christina looked at him coldly. "No."

"You're lying to me." William stared into her eyes, trying to find a hint of truth.

Christina's eyes were as calm as a still lake. "I don't want to lie to you, but whether she's your daughter or not doesn't matter. William, you're not fit to be a father. You deserve to be alone."

Her words hit William like a dagger to the heart.

Was she still blaming him?

But maybe she had every right to. He opened his mouth, hesitated for a long time, but couldn't say a word. Finally, he sighed deeply.

"Christina, I'm sorry. I just want to make it up to you. Four years ago, you didn't give me the chance. Now..."

"Now, it's still not going to happen." Christina smiled faintly. "I brought Harper back to Stargate City because I have some matters to deal with here."

William felt like a knife was twisting in his heart.

The pain was sharp when it went in, but as it twisted and was pulled out, the agony was unbearable, and he couldn't recover.

"Christina, it seems I really hurt you deeply."

"Forget it. It's all in the past. I don't want to talk to you anymore. Just go. And don't come near Harper unless it's necessary," Christina said coldly.

Harper was starting to look more and more like her daughter from her previous life. She was almost certain that the daughter she lost had returned to her.

But so what? The child was back, but did that mean the hurt was gone?

When she returned to the room, the nanny was getting ready to leave.

Christina sighed, went to her room, and changed into comfortable home clothes.

When she turned around, she saw Harper standing by the door, hugging her teddy bear.

"Mom, why do you hate Dad Cavendish so much?"

"I don't hate him. It's just that you have to be cautious around people. If he's getting close to you, he must have an ulterior motive. So, don't invite strangers into our home, okay?" Christina said seriously.

Harper pouted. "But I don't think Dad Cavendish is a bad person. He's really nice to me."

Christina felt a bit dazed.

So much time had passed, and she could barely remember the events of her past life.

But she still remembered that Harper had been very afraid of William in her past life because whenever he came back, it brought disaster and turmoil to their lives.

Christina snapped out of it and patted Harper's head. "Some people aren't what they seem. I just want you to protect yourself."

William could never be trusted. He might seem ready to be a father now, but he wasn't worthy.

Christina was busy preparing for a lecture.

Kelvin had given her this opportunity, and even though she was filling in for someone else, she didn't want to do a sloppy job and embarrass herself as Kelvin's student.

After Harper was brought back, she held a brochure.

"Mom, the teacher said all the students need to bring their parents for a field trip. It sounds so fun."

"A field trip?" Christina glanced at the brochure and felt a bit tired. "Didn't you just have a parent-child sports day? Now a field trip? Your preschool sure has a lot of activities."

"That's because you enrolled me in a good preschool, Mom. The teacher said we should explore nature at our age instead of just staying home and learning from books. It limits our imagination."

Harper made a good point.

Christina sighed and patted her head.

"When is it?"

"Next Wednesday!" Harper answered immediately.

Christina hesitated.

"But, but Mom has work next Wednesday. I really can't get away."

Harper pouted. "What should I do then? It's such a fun activity. Are you really not coming, Mom?"

"Mom already promised someone else. We can't break our promises." Christina felt a pang of softness seeing Harper's disappointed face.

Harper was disappointed but still cheerful.

"Okay, Mom said we can't break our promises. If you promised someone else, I can't let you break your word."

"Good girl." Christina stroked her hair. "I'll have the nanny go with you, okay? If I finish early, I'll come find you. Maybe I'll make it in time."

"Okay! The teacher said there's a big flower field there. It's so beautiful." Harper cheered up again.

Seeing her daughter's face, Christina couldn't help but smile.

On Wednesday, Christina went to the lecture. As the main speaker, she wasn't as nervous as she had imagined. Instead, she spoke confidently.

When it was almost time to leave, she finished her speech and was about to go when the host stopped her.

"I didn't expect Kelvin's students to be so outstanding. Even a substitute speaker did so well. The students were captivated."

"You're too kind." Christina smiled modestly.

"By the way, our architecture department is having a faculty gathering. Would you like to join? It would be a great opportunity for everyone to discuss and learn from each other," the host invited.

###chapter 228 Let Your Daughter Die with Me

Christina was in a tough spot.

The event organizer noticed her expression and spoke more sternly, "What, you think we're not good enough or something?"

Christina tried to sound casual, "Oh, no, it's not that. It's just that my daughter has a field trip at her preschool, and I promised her I'd be there."

"Didn't expect Ms. Windsor to have a daughter at such a young age," the organizer shook his head, "Well, in that case, let's reschedule for another time."

Christina breathed a sigh of relief. "Thank you, I promise I'll make it next time."

With that, she hurried out, got in her car, and drove to the field trip location.

The place was easy to find on the GPS, but the vast flower fields made it hard to spot the kids. She drove around aimlessly for a while.

Unable to find them, she called the teacher.

"Hi, where are you guys? I finished my work and came to find my daughter."

"Are you Harper's mom? I thought Harper's dad was coming. I'll send you the location," the teacher replied cheerfully.

Christina was taken aback, "Harper's dad?"

"Yes, he came with your nanny. The one who helped Harper with her crafts the other day. He said he was Harper's dad."

William again. Christina couldn't believe he was still meddling.

She took a deep breath, her voice heavy, "I'll be right there."

When she arrived at the location, she saw a large flower field with kids playing. She quickly spotted Harper and William playing with other children.

She walked over briskly, "What are you doing here?"

William was surprised to see her and turned around, "I..."

"Don't stammer. Didn't I make myself clear the other night? Why do you keep intruding into our lives?" Christina bit her lip.

Her raised voice drew the attention of others around them.

Not wanting to be the center of attention, Christina softened her tone and looked at Harper, "Harper, can you play with the other kids for a bit? Mommy needs to talk to him."

Harper hesitated but nodded, "Okay."

Children are sensitive, and Harper probably sensed something from her tone, but Christina couldn't worry about that now.

They found a secluded spot, and Christina faced William.

"William, what do you want?"

William looked at her, "I'm just trying to show you I can be a good dad."

"So what? Harper isn't your child. Being his dad means nothing," Christina said coldly.

"How can you say that?" William couldn't believe it, "You're lying."

"Why would I lie to you?" Christina scoffed, "Stop deluding yourself. I'm warning you, if you keep invading our lives, I'll take Harper and leave."

William felt a mix of emotions.

He thought that since Christina had returned, there was a chance for them.

Christina took a deep breath, "I'll be with my daughter for the rest of the trip. You don't need to stay."

As soon as she finished speaking, William's face turned pale. He looked at Christina, a hint of struggle in his eyes, but he said nothing and walked away.

Christina turned to find Harper, but then she heard police sirens in the distance.

A man was running frantically along the field's edge, with several police officers shouting behind him, "Stop! Stop! Come with us for questioning."

Seeing a group of children playing nearby, the police were on high alert.

"Move! Everyone, move!"

Parents scrambled to grab their children and head to safety.

Christina rushed towards her daughter.

"Harper, come here!"

But the worst happened.

The crazed man lunged down the slope, tumbled in the dirt, and staggered to his feet, heading straight for Harper.

Harper, terrified, screamed, "Mommy!" and ran towards Christina.

Christina reached out to grab her.

In that split second, the man seized Harper, pulling out a folding knife and pressing it to her neck, shouting, "Stay back! Everyone, stay back!"

Harper, tears streaming down her face, whimpered, "Mommy, help me."

Christina's heart shattered.

The police arrived.

"Colt, don't do anything rash. You've already made mistakes. Don't make it worse. A severe sentence means no turning back."

"I have nothing left!" Colt shouted, "This little girl is so loved by her parents. Why wasn't I born into a family like that? She can come with me."

Christina was on the verge of breaking down, "Please, don't hurt her. I'll do anything you want if you let her go."

"Really? I want her to die with me," Colt tightened his grip.

The police called for backup.

One officer tried to reason with Colt, "You have a future, and so does this little girl. Don't be so extreme. Tell us your demands, and we'll meet them. Don't give up on yourself."

Colt hesitated, but despair quickly took over. He sneered, lightly grazing Harper's neck with the knife, making Christina's heart clench.

"Can you meet my demands? Can you give me the future I want?" Colt's voice dripped with sarcasm.

The police watched him closely, hands slowly moving towards their holsters. They knew any sudden move could escalate the situation.

"Colt, tell us what you want. We'll do our best to meet your demands," one officer said calmly, trying to keep Colt's emotions in check.

Colt seemed to enjoy this, making outrageous demands from money to a safe escape. Christina knew now wasn't the time to argue. The priority was Harper's safety.

###chapter 229 This Injury Is Really Worth It

"Colt, please, let Harper go. I'll do anything," Christina's voice shook as she pleaded with the madman in front of her.

Harper's cries grew louder, "Mom, I'm scared! I don't want to die!"

Colt showed no sympathy for the child's cries. Instead, he pointed the knife closer to Harper. "Shut up."

Just then, William returned, sneaking up from behind, slightly out of breath, and nervously eyeing the deranged Colt.

Christina noticed William's arrival, a flicker of complex emotions crossed her face, but her concern for her daughter quickly took over. She anxiously signaled to William with her eyes, urging him not to act rashly.

William nodded, understanding Christina's message. He wouldn't make things worse. He slowly approached, trying not to draw Colt's attention.

Meanwhile, the police were also looking for an opportunity. They had already called in the SWAT team for backup, but time was running out. They couldn't wait and had to act immediately.

Though the people surrounding Colt weren't police officers, they had no choice but to try reasoning with him, speaking softly to divert his attention.

"The money, the escape route, and the vehicle are all ready. They're on their way now. Just let the girl go safely, and we'll let you leave too."

"Hurry up, time's running out," Colt said, waving the knife menacingly.

At that moment, the sound of a car approaching caught Colt's attention.

This was the chance!

As Colt turned his head towards the car, William lunged at him. His movements were swift and precise, and before Colt could react, William had disarmed him.

Colt was instantly enraged and confused, not expecting the sudden attack. He fought back furiously.

The scene turned chaotic as William and Colt wrestled on the ground. Colt swung his fists wildly, trying to hit William. Despite William's skills, Colt's frenzied attacks were hard to fend off.

The knife fell to the ground during the struggle. Colt quickly grabbed it and stabbed William repeatedly.

William grunted in pain, grabbing Colt's wrist to prevent him from hurting anyone else.

Christina rushed forward, scooping Harper into her arms and covering her eyes. She watched William anxiously. "Be careful!"

The police, standing twenty meters away, finally reacted and rushed forward.

As Colt raised the knife again, a police officer delivered a flying kick to Colt's wrist, causing the knife to drop.

The police quickly pinned Colt to the ground and handcuffed him.

"You don't even spare kids, you bastard."

"He's hurt badly, losing a lot of blood," another officer said after a quick check, immediately calling for an ambulance.

William, pale from blood loss, sat up and waved weakly. "I'm fine."

"Regardless, you need to go to the hospital," the officer insisted, tying a tourniquet around William's arm to stop the bleeding.

Christina was stunned by William's selflessness. The moment left a deep impression on her.

The ambulance arrived quickly. As William was helped into the vehicle, he looked back at Harper. "Take Harper to the hospital too. Her neck seems injured."

Christina hadn't noticed this. She quickly checked Harper. "Are you okay, sweetie?"

"I'm okay, just my neck hurts a bit," Harper said tearfully. "I want to go to the hospital."

Fortunately, Colt hadn't inflicted serious harm. Harper had only a shallow cut on her neck. Christina held her tightly as they got into the ambulance and headed to the nearest hospital.

Harper's wound was minor and easily treated.

William, however, had more severe injuries. The wound on his arm was deep, and the saline solution stung as it was applied, nearly causing him to pass out from the pain.

Christina gritted her teeth. "Why did you..."

"Save Harper?" William asked through clenched teeth.

Christina didn't respond.

William smiled weakly. "She's a child. It's everyone's duty to protect children. Don't feel too burdened."

Christina felt a mix of emotions.

William had hurt her and Harper in the past, but recently, he had repeatedly helped and saved them.

Was he really ready to be a father?

"I'm fine. Go be with Harper," William said, seeing her standing at the door, trying not to show his pain.

Christina took a deep breath. "Harper's fine."

"That's rare," William said, sweating from the pain. "Since you came back, we haven't really talked."

"What do you want to talk about?" Christina asked, turning to him.

William had so much to say after all these years, but now, he didn't know where to start.

The room was eerily quiet.

Harper's arrival broke the awkward silence.

"Dad Cavendish, you saved me again."

Her eyes were red from crying, but they were filled with admiration.

She threw herself into William's arms.

William winced in pain. "Harper..."

Christina quickly pulled Harper away. "Be careful, he's hurt."

Harper cried harder. "Is Dad Cavendish badly hurt? Should we take him home to care for him? You always said we should repay kindness."

For a moment, William felt that getting closer to Harper was a wise decision.

With Harper as a mediator, his relationship with Christina could improve significantly.

Christina sighed. "Repaying kindness is important, but men and women are different. I can't take him home, but I'll cover his medical and recovery expenses."

Harper blinked. "Okay."

Christina looked at William. "If you need anything while you're recovering, just let me know."

William suddenly felt that his injuries were worth it.

"Okay."

###chapter 230 Can I Attend the Birthday Party?

William had a foolproof plan.

He decided to start with the kids.

At the hospital, he didn't mention it to Christina. She was swamped with work, so he just called for a nurse.

Unexpectedly, Christina got stuck at work and couldn't pick up their child on time.

By the time she finished her overtime and rushed to the preschool, Harper had already been waiting in the security office for an hour.

She greeted the security guard first, then picked up Harper. "I'm so sorry, sweetie. Mommy's late."

"It's okay, Mommy. The security guard was really nice to me. He even gave me candy!" Harper showed Christina the lollipop in her hand.

The security guard was an elderly man in his sixties. His own child had married late, and his granddaughter was also attending the same preschool.

He chuckled and told Christina, "Your daughter is so well-behaved, much better than my granddaughter. She's quite the handful. If you're ever busy and can't pick her up on time, just let her wait in the security office. It's safer and she won't catch a cold standing outside."

"Thank you. Do you smoke? I happen to have a pack here." Christina handed the security guard a pack of cigarettes she had originally planned to give to a client.

The security guard was delighted and became even more friendly. After exchanging a few pleasantries, Christina left the school with Harper.

On the way home, Harper asked, "Mommy, tomorrow is the weekend. Isaac invited me to his birthday party. Can I go?"

Isaac was a boy in her class and Harper's first friend since she transferred schools.

Christina hesitated.

She didn't want to disappoint her daughter, but she had work to do the next day, and Harper was still so young.

Letting her go to someone else's house alone made Christina uneasy.

"Mommy, please. I already told Isaac I would go. He'll be so disappointed if I don't. You're the best mommy in the world. Please say yes." Harper tugged at Christina's shirt, her eyes wide and pleading.

"Mommy, please?"

Seeing her daughter like this, Christina couldn't help but soften.

She needed to work to provide a better life for Harper, which meant she didn't have much time to spend with her.

Other kids had both parents and grandparents, but Harper only had her.

On weekdays, Harper could play with her classmates at preschool, but on weekends, she was often alone at home.

Having someone to play with Harper would be a good thing.

"Harper, tell Mommy where the party is and how many people will be there."

"The party is at Isaac's house. Don't worry, Mommy. I won't wander off, and all our classmates will be there." Harper promised earnestly.

Harper had always been a reliable child, always following Christina's instructions.

After a moment of hesitation, Christina finally agreed. "Alright, you can go to Isaac's, but we need to set some ground rules. I'll drop you off in the morning and pick you up in the afternoon. No wandering off, okay?"

"If you need to come home early or if anything happens, call me with your watch. I'll come right away. Promise me you won't go anywhere on your own."

"Okay!" Harper nodded eagerly.

She knew how hard her mom worked and didn't want to cause any trouble. "Mommy, don't worry. I promise I'll follow the rules."

Christina focused on driving and didn't say much more.

Harper, sitting in her car seat, sent a voice message to Isaac with her watch: "My mommy said yes! I can come over tomorrow morning."

"That's awesome! I'll go tell my parents the good news right now!" Isaac was thrilled.

He ran to the kitchen, waving his watch at his dad, who was cooking.

"Dad! Harper said yes! She's coming over tomorrow! Look, Dad!"

"Great. After dinner, we'll go to the store to buy some snacks for your friends tomorrow." Juan Stewart put down the spatula and ruffled his son's hair.

Tomorrow was Isaac's birthday, and all his classmates were invited to the party.

As hosts, they needed to make sure everyone was well taken care of.

Juan also wanted to help his friend William.

When Christina went missing years ago, everyone thought she was dead. Juan had the same thought.

But William never gave up searching for her.

Now, years later, Christina was back, and she had a daughter.

Juan didn't know what had happened between them, but as William's friend and a father himself, he understood a father's love for his child.

He wanted to help bring them together.

"Dad, can we get a big cake? If it's too small, there won't be enough for everyone."

"Of course. We'll go to the bakery and you can pick out any cake you want." Juan agreed readily.

He always tried to fulfill his son's reasonable requests.

That afternoon, Juan and Isaac ran errands, ordering the cake and buying supplies. They returned home with bags full of goodies.

Isaac, though tired, was excited and quickly helped organize everything in the living room before going to bed.

The next morning, Christina woke up early.

She had an important meeting at work and needed to leave early. Harper was also up, sitting on the bed looking adorable, like a life-sized Barbie doll.

"Sweetie, go wash up. I'll order breakfast, and then I'll take you to your friend's house. Do you have his address?" Christina asked while doing her makeup.

Harper nodded and pulled a piece of paper from her backpack. It was a note from Isaac with his address.

Christina glanced at the note. Isaac's house wasn't far, just a short drive away.

They left early to avoid rush hour traffic and soon arrived at Isaac's house.

It was in a gated community, a three-story house with a large garden and an outdoor pool.

###chapter 231  Meeting William Again

Christina got out of the car with her daughter and rang the doorbell. Juan soon came out holding Isaac's hand.

Isaac's face lit up when he saw Harper. "Hey, you're here!"

"Yeah, this is my mom," Harper said, introducing Christina quickly.

Isaac got a bit shy in front of Christina. He stood up straight and greeted her politely, "Hi, Ms. Windsor."

"Hi there," Christina replied. She had never met Juan before and didn't know he was friends with William. She was unaware that William had a hand in organizing today's birthday party.

She only saw Juan as another parent from school and spoke to him kindly, "Thanks for inviting Harper to the party. I have some work to do, so I can't stay. She'll be here on her own, but I'll come back to pick her up as soon as I'm done."

"Don't worry, Ms. Windsor. We'll take good care of her," Juan assured her, though he felt a bit disappointed.

Christina not attending the party meant William wouldn't have a chance to see her and possibly rekindle their relationship. But at least Harper was here, and they could spend some time together.

"Bye, Mommy," Harper waved to Christina before walking into the yard hand in hand with Isaac.

Christina watched them until they entered the house, then left, feeling more at ease. She needed to meet with a client and hoped to finish her work quickly so she could return to Harper.

Inside the house, William sat on the couch, full of anticipation. He was eager to see Christina.

When he heard the door open, he looked up quickly, but only saw Harper. Christina wasn't with her.

William knew how much Christina loved their daughter. In both past and present lives, she had always cared deeply for Harper. She wouldn't just drop Harper off alone.

"You two go play upstairs," Juan told Isaac, then walked over to William and explained what had happened. He sighed, "Christina's had a tough few years. When Isaac was little, his mom and I took turns taking care of him, and it was exhausting for both of us. Christina's been doing it all on her own."

Besides raising Harper, Christina had to cover all their expenses, and she was doing it in a foreign country, starting from scratch. The hardships she faced were unimaginable.

"I know," William said, understanding better than anyone. He felt for Christina and Harper. He wanted to make up for his past mistakes and hoped to reunite with them, to live as a family again. Even if Christina didn't want to accept him, he wanted to do something for them.

"I don't know what happened between you two, but women soften when they have children. Harper is your daughter. If you build a good relationship with her, Christina might accept you," Juan encouraged him.After all, Christina hadn't been with anyone else, and Harper didn't have a stepfather. This meant William still had a chance.

William nodded, "I'll go upstairs and hang out with the kids."

He went upstairs and found Harper and Isaac building with LEGO.

"Let's have a contest to see who can build the tallest and coolest structure. The winner gets a piece of chocolate. How about it?" Isaac suggested excitedly.

Chocolate was a big deal for kids. It wasn't about the cost but because their parents usually limited their sugar intake to prevent cavities.

Harper nodded, "Sure, it's 8:30 now. Let's compete until 9:30."

"Okay, I'll set a timer."

Once everything was ready, the competition began.

William watched them for a moment before approaching Harper. "Harper, can I help you build?"

"No way!" Isaac put down his LEGO and said seriously, "We're competing, and no outside help is allowed, Mr. Cavendish. It wouldn't be fair."

Harper agreed, "Dad Cavendish, we can compete on our own. You can be the judge."

"Alright, I'll keep track of the time," William said, respecting their wishes.

He sat nearby, his eyes on Harper. She was so adorable, with eyes like his and a nose and mouth like Christina's. Her cheeks were chubby, and she was full of energy.

Christina had done a wonderful job raising Harper. She feared he might take Harper away, but he couldn't bear the thought. Just being near his daughter was enough for him.

An hour flew by, and the timer went off. Harper and Isaac put down their LEGO.

"Mr. Cavendish, can you judge our contest? Who do you think built the best one?" Isaac asked.

Their structures were about the same height but different shapes. Isaac had built a castle, while Harper's looked more like a tower.

William looked at both creations. "You both did a great job. It's a tie."

"But there's only one piece of chocolate. Who gets it?" Isaac was suddenly troubled.

The chocolate was a special one he had brought back from a trip abroad with his dad, and he had saved the last piece.

"Since it's a tie, you should share the chocolate," William said, breaking it in half.

Now they both got to enjoy the chocolate.

"It tastes really good, different from any I've had before," Harper said after finishing her piece.

William took note of the chocolate's packaging and sent a picture to his assistant, asking them to buy more. He couldn't give Harper too much at once, but he could treat her occasionally.

The other kids from the class had arrived, and their noise filled the house. William stood up, "Let's go downstairs and join the others."

Harper and Isaac followed him down to join the fun.

###chapter 232 Doting Father

As they headed downstairs, Harper leaned in close to Isaac's ear. "Happy birthday, birthday boy."

"Thanks, Harper," Isaac replied, feeling a warm glow inside.

When they reached the living room, other classmates and parents also showered him with birthday wishes.

Families who could afford this private preschool were generally well-off, but not everyone lived in a mansion like Isaac's family.

Especially with William standing nearby.

Many parents were eager to use this opportunity to get closer to William.

"Time to cut the cake! The first slice goes to our birthday boy," Juan said, handing Isaac the knife.

Isaac stood on his tiptoes, carefully cutting the cake. He gave the first piece to his dad, the second to Harper, and only the third to himself.

The cake had multiple layers, so it wasn't practical for Isaac to cut it all by himself. After a few slices, he handed the knife to the nanny, who took over distributing the cake.

Harper picked up a small fork, took a bite, and exclaimed, "This is so good!"

"You've got frosting all over your face, little kitten," William said gently, wiping the cream from her mouth.

He couldn't get enough of looking at his daughter. Remembering Harper's tragic fate in his past life made his heart ache. This time around, he was determined to protect her.

He wanted to stay with Harper, but she was at an age where she preferred playing with her friends.

Just then, Isaac took Harper's hand. "Let's go play hide and seek."

Harper agreed happily, and the two kids ran off together.

William didn't stop them, but he felt a bit uneasy.

"I know you want to bond with your daughter, but you can't rush it. Look at the other kids-they're all running around. You can't expect Harper to stay by your side all the time," Juan said, trying to console him.

As parents, learning to let go bit by bit is part of raising children. When they're born, they rely on you completely, but as they grow, go to school, become adults, and eventually start their own families, they will have their own lives. Parents can only do their best to help and respect their children's choices.

"I understand what you're saying, but Harper is still so young," William replied, his past life memories making it hard for him to relax.

He was trying his best to control himself.

Juan felt helpless. He never expected the formidable William to turn into such a doting father. If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn't have believed it!

"Dad Cavendish, I'm hungry. Can you get me some snacks?" Harper asked, running back to William after playing for a while.

William was more than happy to oblige. He fetched her some treats and a drink, bustling around with a devoted attitude.

He was more than willing to take care of Harper.

But this scene didn't sit well with everyone.

"She's already clinging to men at such a young age. What kind of person will she grow up to be?" a short-haired woman muttered under her breath.

Her name was Brynn Elise. After discovering her husband's infidelity post-childbirth, they divorced, and she became a single mom.

Raising a child alone was tough. Plus, seeing other kids in the class with their dads while her son Yosef had none made her feel even worse.

So when Harper transferred to the school, Brynn was initially friendly towards Christina, another single mom.

But today, seeing Harper run to William and cling to him, Brynn felt extremely displeased.

William had a wife, though she had been missing for years, leading many to suspect she was dead. Even so, William would never be interested in a divorced woman with a child. Did Christina have any self-awareness?

And Harper, at such a young age, already knew how to cling to men. What kind of person would she grow up to be?

"Mom, I want to play with Harper," Yosef said, hugging her leg.

This statement infuriated Brynn.

She smacked his bottom twice. "Play, play, play! All you think about is playing. You're so young and already infatuated with her. Have you forgotten? Your dad left us because he was seduced by a woman. Do you want to become like him?"

Yosef had grown up hearing his mom curse his dad. His dad ignored them, only sending child support each month and nothing else. He hated his dad.

Now, his mom was saying he was like his dad. He didn't want to become the person he despised most.

Tears welled up in his eyes. "Mom, don't be mad. I won't play with Harper anymore. I won't go near her."

"Stay away from her at school too, got it?" Brynn continued to scold him.

Only when he tearfully agreed did she let him go. "Alright, go play."

Yosef had come over smiling but now ran off crying.

He wanted to play with the other kids, but they were playing hide and seek with Harper, and his mom wouldn't let him play with her.

So he decided to make Harper leave.

As soon as he spoke up, Isaac was furious. "Harper is my guest and my best friend. This is my house. Why should she leave just because you say so?"

"Yeah, we all like playing with Harper. If you don't, you can leave."

"We didn't force you to come."

"If you want to play with us, follow our rules. We're not going to exclude someone else for you."

The other kids chimed in, all attacking Yosef.

His words had been too harsh!

Harper was much more popular than he was. If they had to choose, they would definitely pick Harper and kick Yosef out.

"But, I, I..." Yosef wanted to say Harper was a bad influence and that playing with her would lead to no good. Their dads might even be seduced by her, just like his dad.

But Isaac didn't give him a chance to speak. "We don't want to hear it. If you don't want to stay, then leave. I don't really want to host you anyway."

Yosef watched as they continued playing hide and seek, everyone smiling and laughing, while he stood alone, completely out of place.

###chapter 233 Harper Falls into the Water

At that moment, Yosef really wanted to go home.

But his mom had reminded him multiple times before they left this morning to behave today. She wanted to take this opportunity to expand her client base and make some money to support him.

If he threw a fit about going home now, his mom would definitely get angry and scold him.

And if she didn't make any money, they'd be stuck eating plain vegetables again. He was so tired of eating vegetables with no flavor.

So, he just stood there, watching.

But even then, Brynn wasn't satisfied. After getting snubbed by two parents, she walked over to her son, knelt down, and scolded him in a voice only they could hear.

"You wanted to come out and play, and I agreed and brought you here. Why are you just standing here like you're being punished? If you're going to act like this, why did I even bring you? Can't you play with the other kids and make some friends?"

If Yosef got along with the other kids, their parents might be more open to her, and she might be able to land a few clients.

"But Mom, they all like playing with Harper." Yosef didn't understand what he needed to do to make his mom happy.

Brynn was beyond frustrated and didn't want to hear it. "Why are you so useless? Even that brat is more popular than you."

Her words cut Yosef deeply, like a knife to his heart.

His eyes filled with tears.

But Brynn didn't notice. She vented a few more words at him and then walked away.

It was still early, and she wanted to try again. Maybe someone would buy her insurance.

Yosef walked outside alone.

The lawn was decorated with all sorts of ornaments and lots of pink and blue balloons.

The other kids were running around on the lawn, and the most dazzling one among them was Harper.

She was cute and wore a pink princess dress today, looking like a real little princess.

And him?

Yosef looked down at his own faded clothes. He envied Harper for having such a gentle mom, but his mom said Harper was a brat.

If only Harper would disappear.

Then he could play with the other kids, and his mom wouldn't be so angry.

He glanced at the swimming pool nearby and got an idea.

When Harper walked to the edge of the artificial lake, he ran over as fast as he could and shoved her hard.

With a splash, Harper's small body was thrown into the water.

She hadn't even had time to react before she swallowed a few mouthfuls of water.

The pool wasn't deep for adults, but for a kindergartener like Harper, it was very deep. Plus, she had never learned how to save herself if she fell into water.

People were coming and going, cheering and laughing, and no one noticed the artificial lake.

Harper tried to call for help, but as soon as she opened her mouth, water rushed in. The feeling of suffocation was unbearable.

Yosef stood by, watching, not moving.

Harper's struggles grew weaker, and her body kept sinking. At that moment, she really wanted to see her mom.

If her mom were here, she would definitely protect her.

At that critical moment, William noticed something was wrong.

Since Harper and the other kids had gone outside to play, he had been keeping an eye on her.

A gust of wind had blown sand into his eyes, and by the time he rubbed them and looked again, Harper was gone.

Did she go back inside?

He was about to go check when he noticed ripples on the pool's surface out of the corner of his eye.

Maybe it was a father's intuition, but he suddenly felt a strong sense of panic, something he had never felt before.

He quickly walked over and looked down. The small body at the bottom of the pool was his daughter, Harper!

He stripped off his jacket and dove into the water, pulling Harper out as fast as he could and starting CPR.

People nearby noticed and rushed over to help.

Yosef, terrified, ran to find Brynn. "Mom, can we go home?"

"The party isn't over, and no one else is leaving. Why are you making a fuss about going?" Brynn frowned. "If I didn't let you come, you'd say I'm a bad mom. Now that you're here, you're causing trouble."

"But Harper fell in the water." Yosef was just a kid and couldn't handle the pressure.

He was scared.

If people found out he had pushed Harper, he'd be completely isolated at school. So he wanted to leave, thinking that if he left, the whole thing would be over.

Brynn's tone grew more impatient. "So what? She's not dead, is she? Even if she died, what's it got to do with you?"

"I" Yosef's mouth opened and closed, but he didn't dare confess what he had done.

Meanwhile, Christina was on her way.

After finishing work, she had immediately called a cab to get there as soon as possible to see Harper.

But halfway there, she suddenly felt a wave of panic. "Driver, can you go any faster?"

"I'm already going as fast as I can without speeding. Just hang in there; we're almost there. Look, the GPS says less than two miles." The driver pointed to the traffic cameras outside.

"See those cameras? If I speed, the cops will be calling me. Plus, speeding is dangerous."

Christina knew she couldn't push him further.

But her heart was pounding, as if something terrible was about to happen.

She was anxious.

Finally, the car stopped outside the venue. She grabbed her bag and ran inside.

Pushing through the crowd, she saw William and Harper lying on the ground, receiving CPR.

At that moment, her heart broke.

Harper was her everything, her biggest motivation to keep going. She had worked so hard these past few years to ensure Harper grew up safe and sound, not repeating the tragedies of the past.

But now?

Her daughter lay there, half-dead, soaking wet, her hair plastered to her face, her little face red, and her lips purple.

"William, are you crazy?" She couldn't control her emotions anymore and shoved William aside.

She had only one thought: she had to save Harper.

She knelt down and continued CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Finally, Harper coughed up the last bit of water and slowly opened her eyes.

"Mommy" Harper whispered. "Am I not dead?"

###chapter 234 Are You Deliberately Targeting Me?

"You're alive and well, and you're gonna live a long, happy life," Christina said, hugging her daughter tightly as tears streamed down her face.

Thankfully, it was just a scare. Her daughter was safe and sound.

If anything had happened to Harper, Christina wouldn't have had the will to go on.

"Mommy, I thought I'd never see you again," Harper said, her small face pressed against Christina's chest, sobbing softly.

Christina stood up, still holding Harper. "Let's get you to the hospital and checked out."

She couldn't worry about anything else right now. Everything else could wait until Harper was safe.

William hurried to catch up. "I'll drive you to the hospital."

"No need," Christina said, turning to look at him with eyes full of hatred.

She truly despised him.

Her look made William's heart ache. "Christina, it's hard to get a cab here. Harper needs medical attention quickly."

"I said get lost. If it weren't for you, Harper wouldn't have gotten hurt. Every time you come near us, something bad happens." Christina didn't want to see him, let alone accept his help.

Harper had been fine all these years, with only minor scrapes that a little iodine could fix.

But just now, Harper had almost drowned and was now trembling in her arms.

William claimed he wanted to make things right, but this was his idea of making things right?

He might as well disappear forever. At least then, they could live peacefully, and Harper wouldn't have fallen into the water.

"I'll take her to the hospital. We can talk about everything else later," Juan said, rushing over with his car keys.

Isaac wanted to come along, worried about Harper, but the nanny held him back.

Christina didn't refuse. She got into Juan's car with Harper.

William followed in his own car.

At the hospital, Christina took Harper to the emergency room. While waiting for the results, William approached to apologize. "I didn't take good care of Harper today. I'm sorry."

"You didn't take care of her, or you just don't care? We both know the truth. Just because I don't bring it up doesn't mean I've forgotten," Christina said coldly.

She would never forget how William had treated her when she had come to him with their child in her arms.

He had been so indifferent, not caring about her or Harper.

Since he didn't care, and she hadn't forced him to take responsibility, why was he pretending now?

"Or are you just trying to make me miserable by using Harper as a tool to hurt me?"

"Christina, don't say that," William said, pained.

That was his daughter. How could he ever harm her?

He felt the same way about Christina. "I've wronged you both. I never wanted to hurt you. I just want you and Harper to have a good life."

"If you disappear from our lives, we'll have a good life. All the pain and hardship come from you. You think you're protecting us, but I realized that without you, there's no storm," Christina said icily.

Juan, standing nearby, couldn't help but intervene. "Ms. Windsor, you misunderstood him. He cares deeply about Harper. He follows her everywhere. No one could have predicted this accident."

"He was the one who saved Harper from the water. He may not be perfect, but you can't deny everything he's done."

Christina looked at Juan, then at William.

If she didn't realize what was happening now, she'd be a fool.

It was clear Juan and William were old friends.

And this birthday party-was it really for Isaac, or was it a setup?

She was furious at herself for being so slow to react, giving William an opportunity. "William, your deceit is beyond belief. You even got someone to speak for you. Why can't you use your cunning for something else? Why target us?"

"Ms. Windsor, he just wants to be with Harper..."

"Shut up," Christina snapped. Now that she knew Juan and William were friends, she couldn't stand the sight of Juan either.

William shook his head at Juan. "You should go."

Juan had no choice but to leave.

"You get out too. I never want to see you again," Christina said just as the doctor approached with the test results.

"Are you the child's parents?" the doctor asked, looking at William and Christina.

"I'm her mother. He's not her father."

"I'm her father," William said at the same time.

The doctor looked at them, puzzled, as if they were a couple who had just had a fight. "Now's not the time to argue. Focus on the child. You can sort out your issues at home."

Christina was livid.

Who was married to William?

But the doctor was right. Harper came first. She couldn't let a title get in the way.

"How is Harper? She seemed to swallow a lot of water," Christina asked.

"She's fine. Most of the water has been expelled. She's okay now, but it's windy today, and she got soaked. She might catch a cold in the next couple of days. Just keep an eye on her," the doctor said, handing over the report.

Christina read it carefully, relieved to see her daughter was fine.

She went to Harper's room. "Harper, do you feel uncomfortable anywhere? Tell Mommy if you do."

"No," Harper said, shaking her head.

She was now in clean clothes, her hair dried by a nurse.

Christina felt her daughter's forehead. No fever yet. "Do you want to stay in the hospital or go home?"

"I want to go home and sleep in my own bed," Harper said. She wasn't picky about where she slept, but the hospital wasn't as comfortable as home.

She preferred her own bed, with the air conditioning on.

###chapter 235 I Will Pursue to the End

"Alright, sweetie, let's get you outta here," Christina said, holding her daughter as they walked out.

At the door, she bumped into William again.

She didn't even look at him; there was no need for any interaction between them.

"Harper, how are you feeling?" William couldn't help but show his concern for his daughter.

He felt a mix of guilt and self-blame. "I'm so sorry I didn't take better care of you. It's my fault you got hurt."

"Dad Cavendish, it's not your fault." Harper was unaware of the issues between the adults, and Christina had never mentioned them to her.

Christina didn't want any of their past unpleasantness to affect her daughter. Harper had suffered enough in her past life; Christina wanted her to be happy and free from any drama in this one.

So, to Harper, William was just someone who cared about her.

The more Harper acted this way, the deeper William's guilt grew.

"I was by the pool when someone suddenly pushed me in," Harper recalled the events of her birthday party.

She had caught a glimpse of a face but wasn't sure.

Christina's heart skipped a beat.

If someone had intentionally pushed Harper, it was attempted murder, and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.

The party was attended by Harper's classmates and their parents. Christina couldn't allow a potential murderer to be around her daughter, not knowing if they might try again.

William was equally concerned. "Do you remember what the person looked like?"

"I think it was Yosef, but I'm not sure. He doesn't seem to like me. He even told Isaac not to play with me. I don't know what I did to upset him." Harper was genuinely puzzled.

She had always been kind to everyone at school and had never had any arguments.

She had played with Yosef before without any issues.

But at the party, he had suddenly said those things. Fortunately, none of the other kids listened to him.

William's expression grew more serious. "I understand. You go home with your mom and rest. Take a few days off from school. I'll handle the rest."

"I'll take care of this. I don't need your help," Christina said, not wanting to be harsh in front of Harper but not willing to be friendly with William either.

William didn't argue.

But he had already decided to get to the bottom of this and make sure the person responsible paid for what they did.

Neither of them knew that a reporter had captured the scene and it was already spreading online.

Back home, Christina contacted Harper's teacher and explained the situation, requesting a week off for Harper.

"Take your time. Harper's health is the priority. Let me know when she's ready to come back," the teacher said, understanding the seriousness of the situation.

A child falling into a pool was no small matter.

For several days, Harper didn't go to school.

Isaac and the other kids were worried about her and talked about it during recess.

"How's Harper doing? Isaac, do you know anything?"

"No."

"Your dad knows Harper's mom, right? Can you ask him? It'll put our minds at ease."

"Or I could ask my mom if I can visit Harper."

"Don't worry, I'll ask my dad tonight," Isaac assured them. "Leave it to me."

Yosef stood nearby, feeling both scared and resentful.

Why was everyone so concerned about Harper?

Why couldn't someone care about him?

He approached them. "Do you guys want to play hide and seek?"

With Harper not around, they could all play together, and he wouldn't have to worry about his mom scolding him.

But the others weren't in the mood for games.

Especially Isaac, who was angry with Yosef. "I don't want to play with you. We're all worried about Harper. You play by yourself."

"What's the point of worrying about her if she's not here?" Yosef snapped, shoving Isaac. "Maybe Harper will never come back!"

He had been the one to push Harper into the pool and had seen her struggle.

His mom had even told him that Harper might die.

Kids tend to believe their parents, and with Harper not returning to school, Yosef was convinced she was gone.

Isaac's eyes filled with tears, and he was ready to fight.

Just then, their teacher walked in with the police.

Children naturally fear the police, and Yosef, feeling guilty, tried to run.

"Yosef, the police need to talk to you. Call your parents and go to the station with them," the teacher said sternly.

Yosef cried and protested, but he couldn't escape the police.

His mom soon arrived, and they went to the station together.

At first, Yosef denied everything, but the police's questions scared him into tears. He still didn't think he was wrong. "Mom said she's a bad person. It's her fault I don't have a dad. I wanted her gone. What's wrong with that?"

"Who are you calling a bad person?" William stormed in, furious.

He couldn't believe his daughter had been treated this way at school.

"Christina is my wife. We are legally married, and Harper is my daughter. You not only spread rumors but also tried to harm my child!"

William was livid.

Brynn, standing nearby, was shocked. "You two are married?"

She realized she had been completely wrong. Harper and William's closeness at the party wasn't inappropriate; it was a normal father-daughter relationship.

A daughter being close to her father was natural. Brynn had been completely mistaken.

###chapter 236  Jennifer's Poisonous Plot

Yosef was just as confused.

He turned to his mom, Brynn, and asked, "Mom, didn't you say those two were just trash? Is he lying?"

These words only made William angrier.

William cherished Christina and Harper so much that he couldn't stand to see them hurt, not even by a harsh word.

But this mother and son, based on some vague assumptions, had hurt Christina and Harper.

"I'm gonna have the Cavendish Corporation's lawyers sue both of you. Your kid's too young for jail, but that doesn't mean he won't face consequences."

"Mr. Cavendish, we know we were wrong. I'm willing to pay for Harper's medical bills. Look, my son is so young. If this blows up, his life will be ruined. Can we settle this privately?" Brynn pleaded desperately.

William was unmoved.

He didn't need the medical bills covered, nor any compensation for emotional distress. He wanted them to face the consequences.

"Your son is young, but so is my daughter. Don't talk to me about this. Handle everything through my lawyer," William said, cutting off Brynn's hopes.

He wasn't generous enough to forgive someone who hurt his daughter.

Only when they faced punishment themselves would they understand the cost of their malice.

Brynn was in tears, but no one present felt sorry for her. They all thought she deserved it.

If she couldn't raise her child properly, society would do it for her.

Soon, Brynn's company received notice and fired her. The kindergarten issued a notice and expelled Yosef.

No school would accept a potential murderer.

With no job and no income, Brynn's attempts to discipline her child at home were futile. She had no choice but to take her child back to their rural hometown in disgrace.

Photos of William at the hospital with Christina and Harper were posted online, sparking memories among netizens.

"Of course, only the rich can be so devoted. He always pampered his wife. When Christina was wronged before, he stood by her and cleared her name."

"What happened before? Can someone fill me in?"

"Just look it up yourself. It's all online."

"Their daughter is so cute, taking after both parents. I wish I had a daughter like that."

Christina could only scoff at these comments.

If she hadn't lived through it herself, she might have thought William was a good man too, based on what was online.

But remembering what happened in the past, all she felt was hatred.

The damage was done. Trying to make amends now was useless.

If apologies could fix everything, there'd be no need for police. Just saying "sorry" wouldn't heal all wounds.

Whoever wanted a man like that could have him. She didn't.

She deleted the messages and marked them as uninteresting, not wanting to pollute her eyes.

Meanwhile, Jennifer was staring at her phone screen, biting her lip until it bled.

Christina had been gone for years, and Jennifer had waited all that time.

She waited for William to forget Christina, to notice her, to marry her and have a child.

But what did she get in return?

Christina came back. Why did she have to come back?

Why couldn't she just die out there?

And Harper, that little brat. Who knew what tricks Christina used to have that child? Now she wanted to use him to climb up. How despicable.

The position of William's wife was hers, Jennifer's.

If Christina could leave once, she could leave again. And Harper, once he was gone, the bond between William and Christina would be broken.

They could never be together again.

Jennifer took a deep breath and contacted a human trafficking ring, sending them Harper's photo and information: "I can help you kidnap this child."

For traffickers, the cuter the child, the higher the price.

Especially a child like Harper, a rare gem in the market.

But they weren't fools. "This is William's daughter. Do you think it's that easy to kidnap her? And why would you help us?"

"Because I have a grudge against this child. It won't be easy for you alone, but with my help, you can succeed. I'll even pay you." Jennifer was willing to do anything to make Harper disappear.

No matter the cost, it was worth it.

To convince them, Jennifer continued typing, "I'll send you some money upfront. Give me your account number. We're partners now, and this benefits us both."

The traffickers hesitantly sent their account number.

Within seconds, Jennifer transferred the money. Once they received the confirmation, their attitude changed. "When do you want us to act?"

"The sooner, the better."

"Then provide us with detailed information. We'll scout the area and find the right moment. Once we have her, you can pay the rest."

Jennifer agreed without hesitation.

Soon, Harper would be sold abroad, and Christina would be separated from William forever.

The one standing by his side would be her, Jennifer!

Harper stayed home for a week to recover. Once Christina was sure she was fine, she sent her back to school.

At the school gate, they ran into William again.

"Harper!" Isaac jumped out of William's car and circled her. "You're all better now. I was so worried about you."

"Why did you get out of Dad Cavendish's car?" Harper asked, puzzled.

Isaac scratched his head. "My dad's been really busy, so he asked Mr. Cavendish to help out."

Kids might say that, but Christina, as an adult, saw through it.

William did it on purpose.

With his workload, no friend would ask him for help. At worst, they'd get an assistant. It wouldn't fall to him to personally pick up Isaac.

###chapter 237  Whose Parents Are You Going to Meet?

"Does that mean I get to see Dad Cavendish every morning?" Harper tilted her head in that adorable way that could melt anyone's heart.

William was both surprised and touched. He stepped forward and gently took her small hand.

"Do you want to see Dad Cavendish every day?"

"I really like Dad Cavendish," Harper said, poking her fingers together. "Even if Dad Cavendish isn't good at crafts, I still like him. It's just that he didn't watch me properly, and Mom got upset."

William couldn't help but feel a bit helpless.

He patted Harper's head with a gentle smile. "Hurry up and get to school!"

Harper looked a bit reluctant. "Will Dad Cavendish come in the afternoon too?"

"Of course, as long as you want to see me, I'll be there," William promised.

Harper beamed with joy. "That's great!"

With that, she followed Isaac into the preschool.

Outside, two shadowy figures appeared.

"This place isn't easy to make a move," one of them said.

The other replied, "Let's just follow for now."

The two sneaky figures then left.

In the afternoon, Kaitlyn invited Christina out for some shopping.

Christina couldn't refuse. She worried that if Kaitlyn was left alone, she'd get lonely and might get into trouble when bored.

When Christina arrived at the meeting spot, she was surprised to see Kaitlyn looking very happy and more maturely dressed than usual.

Kaitlyn wore a chic, color-blocked jacket and a well-tailored skirt, blending playfulness with maturity. She waved at Christina with a serene look in her eyes.

"Christina."

Christina greeted her with a smile. "Have you changed your style? You look so mature."

"Do I look different? Sometimes it's good to change things up," Kaitlyn said with a playful smile, linking arms with Christina. Despite the new look, she was still the same Kaitlyn.

After visiting a few stores, Christina was more interested in finding something nice for Harper, but there weren't many good children's clothing stores nearby.

Kaitlyn picked out a few outfits and turned to Christina with a smile. "Christina, how do these look? Do they make me seem more gentle?"

Christina raised an eyebrow. The outfits did look gentle-a beige knit top and a plaid skirt, paired with low heels, would make her look like a quiet, elegant lady.

"Looks good."

Kaitlyn's eyes lit up. "Should I try them on?"

She headed to the fitting room.

A few minutes later, Kaitlyn emerged, looking elegant and poised, her hair down, completely different from her usual lively self.

Christina suddenly felt something was off. Resting her chin on her hand, she mused, "You look like you're meeting someone's parents. Spill it!"

Kaitlyn's face turned red, clearly hiding something. Christina hadn't expected her casual remark to hit the mark. She pressed on, "Kaitlyn, are you using me to help you pick an outfit for meeting someone's parents?"

Kaitlyn shook Christina's arm. "Come on, Christina, I know I messed up. Just help me out, will you?"

"Are you meeting someone's parents?" Christina teased, grinning.

Kaitlyn nodded. "Yeah, I'm meeting Irvin's parents this weekend."

"What? How did things move so fast? You just got divorced less than a month ago." Christina was stunned.

She knew Kaitlyn wouldn't give up on love after one bad experience, but this was unexpected.

Kaitlyn explained, a bit awkwardly, "Christina, it's not like we're getting married. He recently broke off an engagement, and his family is pressuring him. He asked me to help out as a decoy since he's almost thirty and doesn't want to be nagged about marriage."

"So, you two have been in touch a lot since that day?" Christina laughed.

She could see the chemistry between Kaitlyn and Irvin. Their families were well-matched, and their personalities complemented each other.

She thought it was a good match.

"Alright, I've told you everything. Christina, please stop teasing me, or I'll be embarrassed." Kaitlyn pleaded.

Christina hadn't intended to tease her. She waved her hand. "Okay, I'll help you out."

Maybe it was because she was used to Kaitlyn's usual style, but the gentle, elegant look seemed a bit off. Still, it suited her well enough.

Finally, tired from shopping, Kaitlyn bought the outfit she was wearing and wore it out of the store.

Christina could tell Kaitlyn cared about making a good impression on Irvin's parents. They had almost gotten married once, and the wedding planned for them had ended up being for Kaitlyn and someone else. She was probably worried about that.

But who could predict fate? They had met briefly years ago, and now they had a chance to reconnect.

Christina glanced at her watch.

"It's almost time to pick up the kids from school."

Kaitlyn's eyes lit up. "I've heard so much about your daughter but haven't met her yet. Can I come with you?"

Christina agreed without hesitation.

Luckily, there was no traffic, and they arrived just in time. As they reached the school gate, the preschool teacher was already leading the children out. Harper spotted her and ran over.

"Mommy!"

Christina caught her soft little body and asked with a smile, "How was preschool today?"

"We had noodles for lunch, and they were so yummy! There were ribs too, but I couldn't eat enough because my tummy was full. The teacher was worried I'd get a tummy ache," Harper excitedly shared her day.

Isaac waved to William, who had just arrived and was walking to the gate.

"Mr. Cavendish, over here."

Christina stiffened for a moment and turned to see William.

William walked straight to Isaac. "Let's go, I'll take you home."

Harper waved at him. "Goodbye, Mr. Cavendish."

"Goodbye, Harper," William waved back with a smile.

Their interaction was heartwarming.

After William left, Christina asked, "Did you see him more than once today?"

###chapter 238  How About You Marry Me?

Harper nodded. "He came by this morning to drop Isaac off at school. I happened to see Mr. Cavendish, so I said hi. He mentioned he'd be coming by more often."

Christina couldn't shake the feeling that he had some ulterior motive.

But since he was a friend of Isaac's dad, it was normal for him to be around to pick up the kid. She couldn't really say much about it.

Christina didn't comment, treating him like he was invisible, and took Harper's hand.

"Mommy has a friend who wants to meet you."

As soon as William heard that a friend wanted to meet Harper, he was instantly on high alert.

Was she planning to introduce the kid to some guy and try to win him over in front of the child?

Christina led Harper to the car.

Kaitlyn gently pinched Harper's cheek.

"So this is Harper. I'm a friend of your mom's. You're such a sweet and adorable child!"

"Thank you for the compliment." Harper beamed.

Kaitlyn took her hand. "How about I take you to get some yummy food?"

Harper turned to Christina, her face full of anticipation. "Mommy, can I?"

Christina couldn't say no to her. She nodded. "Sure."

Harper's smile grew even wider.

In the car, Harper wanted to sit by the window to watch the scenery.

Kaitlyn pulled her close, finding her irresistibly cute. "How can you be so lovable? I never liked kids before, but seeing you, Harper, I've changed my mind."

Christina chuckled. "Then why don't you have one of your own?"

Honestly, if it weren't for the hope that having Harper would bring her closer, she wouldn't have wanted another child. Thankfully, fate had been kind, bringing her daughter back to her.

Kaitlyn leaned against her, lowering her voice with a mischievous smile. "Having a baby isn't as convenient as just letting your daughter be mine."

"Keep dreaming." Christina shot her a look.

Kaitlyn sighed. "Honestly, if I'd known kids were this cute, I would've taken better care of myself. Maybe I wouldn't have lost that baby."

Christina saw her sadness and quickly comforted her. "Don't worry, there's still plenty of time. You'll have another chance."

Kaitlyn nodded and pinched Harper's cheek again, smiling. "For now, I just hope to have a cute daughter someday."

Having a goal was good, no matter what it was.

Kaitlyn took them to a very fancy restaurant.

To their surprise, Irvin was already there when they arrived at the private room.

"Kaitlyn."

He looked a bit surprised to see Christina and Harper. "You brought guests?"

"Yeah, this is my best friend. You might have met before, but probably don't remember." Kaitlyn picked up Harper and turned her to face him. "Isn't she adorable?"

Irvin couldn't help but smile when he saw Harper.

"Adorable. Kids are the cutest."

He turned to the restaurant manager. "Prepare a kid's meal."

The manager nodded and went to get it ready.

Christina smiled apologetically. "Sorry for the trouble."

"No trouble at all," Irvin said warmly.

The food was amazing, and there was a natural warmth between Kaitlyn and Irvin, like they had known each other forever.

After the meal, Irvin walked them to the parking lot and pulled some supplements from the trunk. "These are all-natural, a gift from a friend. I thought they'd be perfect for Kelvin. Take them for him."

"Oh, I couldn't," Kaitlyn tried to refuse.

Irvin took her hand and placed the items in it. "No need to be shy. They're perfect for Kelvin. Just take them."

Kaitlyn couldn't refuse any longer and accepted them.

She looked at Irvin with a bit more warmth in her eyes.

That weekend, Irvin brought Kaitlyn to his home.

Kaitlyn was a bit nervous. Even though their relationship was fake, just to appease his parents, she still felt guilty about her past mistakes.

To her surprise, Irvin's mother, Emma Kate, greeted her warmly as soon as they walked in.

"Kaitlyn, you're here!"

Kaitlyn quickly presented the gift she had prepared. "Mrs. Hays, hello. I brought you some skincare products, custom-made abroad. They're perfect for you."

"You didn't have to bring anything," Emma said, ushering her in.

"Mrs. Hays, I couldn't come empty-handed. That would be disrespectful to the Fisher family." Kaitlyn smiled playfully.

Emma didn't mind and led her inside.

Watching Kaitlyn and Irvin sit on the couch, Emma sighed. "You two look great together. I regretted not having you as my daughter-in-law back then. I can't believe there's another chance now."

Kaitlyn scratched her head, embarrassed. "Mrs. Hays, I..."

"Mom, let's not talk about that," Irvin quickly interrupted.

Emma realized her mistake. "You're right, that's all in the past. Kaitlyn, when do you plan to get married?"

Kaitlyn glanced at Irvin. "I want to take my time and not rush into it."

"You and Irvin aren't getting any younger. You've both been through a lot. If you can settle down, you should. I trust you both to make the right decision." Emma's voice was gentle.

Kaitlyn was taken aback by their urgency and didn't know how to respond.

Irvin stepped in. "Mom, that's enough. I'll take Kaitlyn for a walk."

Kaitlyn stood up, feeling awkward. "Mrs. Hays, I'll go with Irvin for a bit."

Once they were outside, she breathed a sigh of relief.

The garden was well-maintained, with beautifully trimmed flowers.

Irvin handed Kaitlyn a glass of water, looking a bit uneasy. "Sorry about that..."

"It's okay. I promised to help you." Kaitlyn took a sip of water.

Irvin took a deep breath. "My mom likes you so much. Why don't you marry me?"

Kaitlyn almost choked on her water. She stared at him in disbelief. "You... you..."

Irvin didn't say it was a joke. He looked at her expectantly.

Kaitlyn took a deep breath. "Are you kidding? You can't marry me just because your mom likes me. You need to find someone you love."

"Maybe I..." Irvin stammered.

Before he could finish, Emma called from inside.

"Dinner's ready! Come on in!"

Kaitlyn quickly responded. "Mrs. Hays is calling us. Let's go."

Irvin paused, then nodded. "Okay."

###chapter 239  Amusement Park Invitation

Kaitlyn lay in bed, tossing and turning, unable to stop thinking about what had happened.

She wondered what Irvin really meant. Did he just think she was suitable, or did he actually have feelings for her?

Even though she had been hurt in love before, she didn't want to enter a marriage devoid of love, where life would be as stagnant as a dead pond. That was absolutely unacceptable to her.

She decided to call Christina.

Christina had just put Harper to bed and quickly stepped out onto the balcony to take the call.

"It's so late. What made you think of calling me now?"

Kaitlyn let out a long sigh. "I've been thinking about something for a long time and can't figure it out. I wanted to hear your opinion."

"Well, since you trust me so much, go ahead and tell me!" Christina said with a smile.

Kaitlyn took a deep breath.

"Irvin said we could turn our fake relationship into a real one."

Christina wasn't surprised by this and asked with a smile, "What do you think about it?"

"Me? I don't know!" Kaitlyn shook her head.

"What are you worried about?" Christina pressed on.

Kaitlyn thought for a moment before seriously saying, "Irvin said his mom likes me, so he thinks being with me would be good. But I can't accept a marriage without love."

Christina listened intently to her concerns.

After Kaitlyn finished speaking, Christina gently said, "In all your worries, you never mentioned that you don't like him, right?"

Kaitlyn was stunned for a moment, then laughed. "Christina, you really hit the nail on the head. Maybe I do like him a little."

Christina smiled warmly. "Then take it slow."

"But he's in such a hurry to get married. I'm afraid if I take it slow, I'll miss my chance. I'm so conflicted, Christina." Kaitlyn couldn't help but shout, as if trying to release all the frustration she'd been holding in.

Christina comforted her for a while until Kaitlyn finally calmed down.

"Then just take it one step at a time. I can't agree to anything too quickly. If he really wants to marry someone else, then maybe he doesn't love me enough, and this isn't the relationship I want."

Seeing her so open-minded, Christina felt relieved.

Friday at the kindergarten was full of activities, with everyone playing on various equipment.

Isaac found Harper. "Harper, Mr. Cavendish said he's taking me to the amusement park this weekend. Do you want to come?"

Harper's face lit up. "Yes, yes, I want to go." Then she lowered her head. "But I'm afraid my mom won't let me."

"Just tell her you promised me. We'll go together, okay?" Isaac invited.

Harper thought for a moment, then nodded firmly. "Okay, I'll tell my mom after school."

As soon as class was over, a flock of children burst out like little birds.

Harper spotted Christina in the crowd and ran into her arms. "Mommy."

Christina hugged her small body. "Let's go home. How do you want to spend the weekend, Harper?"

Harper's eyes sparkled, and she played coy. "Will you promise to do what I want?"

Christina patted her head. "Sure."

Harper had been waiting for this answer and straightened up. "Isaac said Mr. Cavendish is taking him to the amusement park and invited me. I agreed, so if you keep your promise, we'll go to the amusement park this weekend."

What?

Christina was stunned.

She hadn't expected Harper to be so thoughtful, but it was good that Harper could stand up for herself.

Christina was hesitant and glanced at William, who had just come to pick up Isaac. She raised her voice on purpose. "Harper, let's not talk about promises yet. Did someone put you up to this?"

"No," Harper quickly denied.

Christina was really torn.

Harper pretended to be angry. "Mommy, you said we should always keep our promises."

Hearing this, Christina sighed. "Alright, I promise."

William, who had been listening, relaxed his furrowed brow.

"Looks like you agreed. I'll come pick you up tomorrow, and we'll go together."

Christina gave him a cold look. "No need. I have my own car. We'll meet there."

With that, she turned and left with Harper.

Seeing her so resistant, William sighed.

Isaac held his hand. "Mr. Cavendish, do you like Harper's mom?"

William was taken aback and coughed to cover it up. "Kids shouldn't say such things."

"Dad says we should be honest. Mr. Cavendish, you're not being honest," Isaac said with wide eyes.

William patted his head. "Alright, I'll take you home. Tomorrow, we'll go to the amusement park."

Hearing about the trip, Isaac forgot everything else and happily bounced around.

The next morning, Harper was up early, eager for the day. Christina had no choice but to get everything ready and head out with her.

Because it was the weekend, the amusement park was crowded.

When they arrived, William and Isaac were already at the ticket gate.

The two kids immediately started playing together, bouncing around.

"Slow down, don't fall," Christina called out, hurrying to keep up.

William quickened his pace too.

In the amusement park, there was a children's zip line. Harper saw it and was immediately excited. "I want to play that."

It was about the height of an adult, with safety measures in place, so Christina wasn't worried. "Okay, you go play. Mommy will watch and cheer you on."

Harper happily got in line. Isaac, who was afraid of heights, didn't want to try it. Harper pulled him along. "Come on, let's go."

Isaac realized that if he got in line, it would leave William and Christina alone in the waiting area, giving them some time together. Reluctantly, he agreed.

With the kids in line, William turned to Christina. "Harper is really happy."

Christina's eyes never left Harper. "Kids are happy when they have something to play with. But don't do this again. If Harper wants to go out, I'll take her."

William was taken aback. "Christina, can't you stop being so resistant? We have a child together."

"So what? She's my child," Christina said coldly, looking off into the distance.

###chapter 240 Harper is Missing

William hesitated, words stuck in his throat.

The two of them stood there, silent and awkward.

Harper was having a blast, while Isaac, despite being exhausted, managed to keep up with the group. When they finally caught up, they noticed William and Christina standing apart, not saying a word to each other.

Isaac felt his efforts to create an opportunity for them were in vain.

Flyers were being handed out in the amusement park.

There was going to be a clown carnival show and fireworks that night. Harper, upon hearing this, excitedly suggested, "Let's stay and watch the fireworks before we go home!"

"That's a whole day. Can you handle it?" Christina asked her.

Harper patted her chest confidently. "Of course I can."

With Harper's enthusiasm, Christina had no choice but to agree.

Because of the kids, Christina and William managed to maintain a semblance of peace.

As night fell, the park lights came on, casting a colorful glow on the children's smiling faces, creating a warm and joyful atmosphere. Harper and Isaac were having the time of their lives at the carnival.

Clowns handed out candy.

Parades of fairy tale characters roamed the streets.

Harper was jumping with joy.

A staff member dressed as a fairy noticed her and took her hand. "Little fairy, would you like to join us?"

"Yes, yes!" Harper nodded eagerly.

The various fairy tale characters made her feel like she had stepped into a storybook, fulfilling her little girl dreams.

Christina, however, felt uneasy.

"She's still young, maybe not."

"It's okay, just for a few minutes," said a staff member dressed as Snow White, smiling warmly.

Harper tugged at her hand. "Please, Mom, let me go."

Seeing her daughter's pleading eyes, Christina relented. "Alright."

Harper was thrilled and immediately followed the staff member onto the parade float.

Christina quickly followed, and William, seeing this, trailed behind.

The parade moved quickly, and soon, after turning a corner, the float disappeared from view.

Christina ran to catch up, but when she finally reached the float, Harper was nowhere to be seen.

"Where's Harper? Where's Harper?"

The float continued moving, ignoring her.

Christina shouted louder, but the fireworks and music drowned out her voice, making it almost impossible for anyone to hear.

William, carrying Isaac, caught up. "What's wrong? What happened?"

Christina was frantic. "Harper's gone! Someone invited her onto the float, and I agreed. But after turning a corner, she disappeared."

Her heart sank.

William rushed to the float, using his strength to stop it.

"Stop right now!"

The music stopped abruptly, and the surroundings fell silent.

Christina shouted again, "Harper, Harper, where are you?"

No response. It felt like Harper was playing hide and seek, but Christina knew Harper would never ignore her calls.

This meant Harper was either not on the float or unable to respond.

"Where did you take my child?" Christina demanded, her voice trembling with fear and anger.

No one answered. She frantically scanned the area but couldn't find the staff member who had taken Harper.

How could this be? She had clearly seen Harper and the staff member get on the float.

In the blink of an eye, they were gone.

William gently put his arm around her shoulders. "Don't worry, we'll call the police. I'll make sure the park gates are watched. No one will take Harper away."

Christina was on the verge of breaking down.

She clenched her teeth and called the police, her hands trembling uncontrollably. She forced herself to dial the number.

With a missing child, the carnival activities came to a halt. The police questioned the staff about the situation.

A staff member said, "We do invite children onto the floats, but it's dangerous, so we usually invite parents too."

"So, inviting a child alone is against the rules? Your staff wouldn't do that?" the officer asked.

The staff member nodded. "Yes, so maybe someone impersonated our staff and took the child."

Christina felt even more desperate.

If it was an imposter, finding Harper would be even harder.

William tried to comfort her. "Don't worry, I'm here. We'll find her."

Christina couldn't hear anything, her mind buzzing.

She didn't know if Harper was taken for ransom or revenge, but either way, Harper's situation couldn't be good.

The police quickly launched an investigation, reviewing the park's surveillance footage.

William mobilized his own people to search the park inside and out. Despite her anxiety, Christina tried to stay calm.

As time passed, the night grew darker, and the park lights seemed more somber. Christina's heart grew heavier. She didn't know where Harper was or if she was safe.

The police searched the park all day, finding almost nothing.

Visitors gradually left under police supervision, and the park emptied. The thorough search suggested Harper might have been taken out of the park.

Christina waited at the police station for news, but hours passed with no updates.

William urged her, "Christina, you've been at it all day. Go home and rest. I'll wait here."

"I'll stay," Christina replied coldly. "You're not her father. This is my responsibility."

"Even now, you still push me away?" William's heart ached.

"One thing at a time," Christina said calmly.

Just then, an officer reviewing the footage made a discovery. "Two staff members took a bag of trash to a garbage truck and left the park. The park's trash schedule doesn't match this time."

The detective rushed over. "Check that truck immediately!"

Christina's emotions surged, and she stood up.

Could the black bag contain Harper? Was she unconscious or drugged?

Dark thoughts filled her mind, spiraling out of control.

The police searched all day.

The garbage truck was last seen at a landfill.

When the police found it, the truck was empty.

###chapter 241  If You Want to See Your Daughter, Come to the Factory

They must have swapped tools nearby, but the lousy surveillance missed it. The cops had to lock down several blocks to check the footage and look for any suspicious vehicles.

This investigation was turning into a massive workload.

Christina stayed up all night, just like the police. Everyone's eyes were bloodshot from exhaustion.

William was worried about her. "The cops are already on it. Staying here won't help. Get some rest. You can go back once there's a lead on the kid."

Christina didn't want to miss any clues.

"Who do you think did this? Kidnapping a kid here costs way more than doing it on the street. Why would they do this? Is someone targeting me?"

William felt heartbroken seeing her like this.

"Christina, don't overthink it now. Let's trust the police, okay? I'll take you home to rest."

"Harper is my child. I carried her for nine months and gave birth to her. You don't understand. You can't understand how important a child is to a mother." Christina pushed him away, shouting hysterically.

William felt a mix of emotions.

Maybe it was the tension from the whole night, or the sudden outburst, but it seemed like something snapped in Christina's mind. She collapsed softly to the ground.

The last thing she saw was William holding her tightly, anxiously shouting, "Christina, Christina!"

Christina had a dream. It was so real she couldn't tell if it was a dream or reality.

She dreamt that Harper was taken to an underground market. The faces of the people there were twisted by greed and money. They were touching Harper's little face.

"Such a pretty little girl is rare, but she's a bit old."

The trafficker tried to persuade them. "She's only three or four. She'll forget everything after a while. Look how beautiful she is. She'll grow up to be prettier than a star, a real money-maker. It's worth it."

She watched as Harper was priced like a commodity, powerless to do anything. She screamed, but no one listened.

"Harper!"

She shouted and woke up abruptly from the dream.

William was no longer by her side. She looked around and saw that she was in a hospital.

"Harper!"

She shouted, pulling out the IV needle from her hand, ready to leave. A nurse rushed over upon hearing the commotion.

"Ms. Windsor, please stay in the hospital. Mr. Cavendish said he's already at the police station waiting for news. Finish your IV before you leave."

Christina couldn't sit still and pushed the nurse's hand away.

"Move!"

The nurse couldn't stop her and felt helpless.

Just as Christina was about to leave the hospital and head to the police station, her phone rang.

She checked the message after getting into the car.

It was from an unknown number.

[Harper is with me. If you want her safe, don't tell anyone. Come alone to South Star Scrap Factory. If I see anyone else, I'll kill Harper immediately.]

Christina's eyes widened in shock.

This wasn't a random kidnapping. It was targeted at her and Harper.

She tried calling the number, but it was always busy, with no one answering.

Her heart sank, feeling like she had fallen into an icy pit.

Who was it? Who would do this to her and her daughter?

She gripped her phone tightly, her knuckles turning white from the pressure. She took a deep breath, telling herself to stay calm and rational for Harper's safety.

She sent a message to William, telling him that someone had kidnapped Harper but not to call the police. She asked him to find a way to South Star Scrap Factory.

Then, she told the taxi driver the destination and sped towards South Star Scrap Factory.

After getting out of the car, she took a deep breath, composed herself, and walked into the scrapyard.

The scrapyard was empty, with only a few rusty steel frames and an old, rusty machine. She looked around but saw no one.

Her heart tightened. Had Harper been taken away? She anxiously searched around and finally came to an abandoned warehouse.

The warehouse door was closed. She hesitated but pushed it open.

"Is anyone here? I'm here alone. Where's Harper?"

The warehouse was vast and empty, with a complex structure and some old equipment piled up. In the center, there was a burning oil drum, emitting a pungent smell.

She fanned the air and asked again, "Where is she? I'm here!"

Her voice echoed in the empty warehouse, but no one answered. Christina's heart was in her throat again. She began to doubt if she had been tricked. Was Harper really here?

Just then, she heard light footsteps behind her. She turned around abruptly.

A person dressed in black stood there, staring at her with eyes full of malice, like a predator ready to hunt.

"Who are you?" Christina asked nervously.

"Who I am doesn't matter. If you want to save your daughter, you'll have to pay the price!" The person sneered, opened the door, and walked out.

The door closed in front of Christina. She rushed forward, pounding on the door.

"What do you want? Where's my daughter?"

No one responded.

Had they left?

Christina took out her phone to call for help, but there was no signal. This place wasn't remote enough to lack signal towers, so someone must have set up a signal jammer.

She kicked the door in frustration.

"Who are you? What do you want?"

The oil drum nearby was still burning fiercely, emitting a noxious smell that hit her head.

She felt something was wrong. It seemed like harmful gas. If she stayed here too long, she might be in danger too.

She looked around and saw a row of windows about thirteen feet high.

There was equipment nearby. She tried pulling it, and it was heavy, but it seemed movable.

The fire couldn't keep burning. Although the space was large, it was enclosed and would soon run out of oxygen. She pushed the oil drum over and stomped out the flames.

After exhausting herself, the fire finally went out.

With some free time, she dragged the old equipment piece by piece under the window, stacking them up. After several attempts, she tried climbing.

The window was still far. She reached a few times and finally grabbed the edge, struggling to pull herself up. But her knee hit the wall, and she let go in pain.

###chapter 242 Disfigurement

Christina hit the ground hard, leaving her dazed and disoriented.

It took her a while to regain her senses. The air around her was thick and suffocating, making it hard to breathe.

She staggered to her feet, grabbed a steel pipe, and smashed it against the window. Luckily, the old factory's glass wasn't reinforced, and it shattered easily. Fresh air rushed in, and she felt a bit better.

The broken window was her only escape route. She piled up some old equipment to climb higher, even though it was risky.

This time, she managed to get closer. With a push, she climbed up to the window.

She was almost out!

As she tried to squeeze through the broken glass, a figure suddenly burst in.

"Trying to escape?"

Damn, the thug hadn't left.

Christina used all her strength to wriggle outside, but just as she was almost through, a hand grabbed her ankle.

"Get back here! You think you can break your promise without consequences?"

"You said I'd see Harper. You lied." Christina didn't believe him anymore and kicked furiously.

But his grip was strong, and he pulled her back inside.

"Let go of me!"

Christina felt her strength waning.

Maybe it was the gas, but her head was spinning, and she felt like she might pass out. The hand holding her loosened, and she teetered on the edge.

She tilted her head and fell.

The person who grabbed her didn't react in time and was knocked down with her.

A piercing scream echoed as they hit the ground.

Christina was dazed but managed to stand up. The first thing she saw was a sharp-edged steel pipe with blood dripping from it.

She instinctively thought she was injured, but after checking herself, she realized she was fine. Then she saw the person in black writhing in pain.

He was clutching his left cheek, screaming in agony.

"Where's Harper?" Christina crouched down, trying to pull away the covering on his face to see who he was.

"Get away!" He recoiled in fear. "My face, my face! You ruined my face!"

Christina suddenly felt something was off.

Despite his masculine appearance and deep voice, he sounded like he was using a voice changer. And he was so concerned about his looks-could he be a woman?

"Who are you?" Christina stepped closer, but before she could touch his face, she felt dizzy.

The person in black grabbed a piece of broken glass from the floor.

"I'll kill you! You ruined my face, I'll kill you!"

He lunged at her like a wild beast.

Christina rolled to the side, dodging the attack.

Just then, footsteps echoed from outside the warehouse. The person in black glared at Christina with hatred, realizing they couldn't finish the job today. They dropped the glass and limped away.

Christina tried to follow and ask about Harper, but she collapsed after a few steps.

Someone rushed over and caught her.

"Christina, are you okay?"

Christina opened her eyes to see William. She grabbed his collar and gritted her teeth. "Go after her! She knows where Harper is. Don't worry about me!"

William glanced at the fleeing figure and then back at Christina.

He scooped her up. "Now's not the time for that. I'm taking you to the hospital!"

Christina struggled weakly. "No, I'm fine. Go after her, or we'll lose our chance."

William reluctantly set her down and chased after the woman.

But he returned a few minutes later. "She's gone. I'm taking you to the hospital. I've already called the police; they'll track her."

Christina was filled with anger.

"This is your fault! If you'd gone after her sooner, she wouldn't have escaped!"

"Fine, it's my fault. But you need to go to the hospital now." William didn't give her a choice and carried her to the car, driving her to the hospital.

The hospital was bustling, likely due to the change of seasons. William got her an urgent appointment.

Christina was breathing heavily, struggling to catch her breath.

The doctor listened to her heartbeat with a stethoscope and asked, "Do you have a history of asthma or throat issues?"

"No, but I think I inhaled some toxic gas. It was really pungent, but I don't know what it was," Christina managed to say.

The doctor quickly wrote an order for a blood test.

William took the order and carried her to the blood draw station.

Christina felt embarrassed by the attention they were getting.

"Put me down. I can walk."

William was stubborn. "You're too weak right now. Just accept my help."

A young couple passed by. The girl, also looking weak, tugged at her boyfriend's arm.

"Look at them. I can't walk either. Carry me!"

The boyfriend didn't hesitate and picked her up. "You're too skinny, babe. You need to eat more."

The girl smiled happily.

But things were different between William and Christina. She couldn't fight back and buried her face in his shoulder, not wanting anyone to see her.

The blood draw station was just a couple of hallways away. William set her down on a chair.

After the blood draw, Christina felt a bit better. She looked at William. "We have new leads. If you don't go to the police station, I will."

"Fine, after we get the blood test results," William agreed but set a condition.

Christina ignored him.

The results came back quickly. The doctor looked at her seriously. "You have mild mercury poisoning. It's not severe, but you have symptoms. You should stay in the hospital for observation to avoid permanent damage to your nerves and kidneys."

Hearing how serious it was, William was firm. "You're staying in the hospital."

"How long?" Christina asked, breathing heavily.

The doctor replied gravely, "We'll need to treat and observe you first. The exact duration depends on your response to treatment. For your health, please cooperate."

###chapter 243  Mild Mercury Poisoning

Christina had no choice but to agree after William insisted.

William immediately went to handle the hospital admission paperwork.

After the doctor administered the medication, Christina felt significantly better.

She struggled to sit up in bed. "The person who fought with me at the factory must know where Harper is. Can you help me find out?"

She wouldn't have asked William for help if it weren't absolutely necessary.

William nodded slightly. "Alright, I'll help you look into it. But I can't promise we'll find anything."

"Is there really something Mr. William Cavendish can't find out?" Christina scoffed.

She suddenly felt that it wasn't that William couldn't find out, but that he didn't want to.

Back at the factory, the person had been injured and seemed to be a woman. How could she have outrun the strong and fit William?

Could it be that he knew her?

Seeing William remain silent, Christina pushed him away.

"If Mr. Cavendish doesn't want to investigate, then don't. I'll handle it myself. You've never cared about Harper, so why pretend in front of me?"

"Christina, must you be like this?" William's expression was pained. "So distant, so sarcastic?"

Christina couldn't be bothered to respond.

"I'm tired. I need to rest."

William took a deep breath, calming his unsettled emotions. "Alright, get some rest. I'll check on you later."

As the sound of footsteps faded away, Christina turned her head.

With Harper missing, how could she possibly sleep?

She called Kaitlyn.

"Kaitlyn, I need a favor."

Kaitlyn's voice was cheerful. "Christina, just tell me what you need. No need to call it a favor!"

Christina took a deep breath. "I need you to find someone for me. This person recently had her left cheek disfigured. Check the hospitals for anyone fitting that description. It might be Jennifer. Focus on her."

"Christina, what's going on? It sounds serious." Kaitlyn was worried.

Christina didn't explain everything, only asking Kaitlyn to investigate.

Kaitlyn could tell Christina was feeling down and didn't press further. "Alright, I'll look into it as soon as possible."

Christina lay in bed, tossing and turning.

Harper had been missing for a day with no leads. The country was vast, and the person behind this was so resourceful. Who knew if Harper was even still in the country?

The thought made her heart ache.

A nurse approached.

"Ms. Windsor, it's time for your medication."

Christina sat up, her pale face startling the nurse.

"Ms. Windsor, are you still feeling unwell? If so, please let us know so we can run more tests."

Christina forced a bitter smile. "It's not the poisoning; it's my mood. I only have mild poisoning. How long do I need to stay in the hospital?"

"Well, we'll check your blood again tomorrow morning. If the levels have decreased, you could be discharged within three days. If not, you'll need to stay longer for observation."

Christina couldn't stand staying any longer. "But I have urgent matters. Can I leave and come back for treatment?"

The nurse shook her head. "It's best to rest and recover from poisoning."

Christina didn't argue further.

She knew her condition wasn't good.

If she went out and fainted, she'd only cause more trouble.

She lay in bed, unable to sleep, feeling like a thousand ants were gnawing at her heart.

Just then, her phone rang.

It was Kaitlyn.

"Hello, any news?"

Kaitlyn responded, "I found her. Jennifer has a medical record. Her face was slashed, and she's being treated at a hospital. After you told me her name, I checked specifically for her. It's definitely her."

"Which hospital?" Christina asked urgently.

Kaitlyn checked and replied, "Harmony Valley Hospital."

Not the hospital she was in!

Christina quickly thanked her and got up to leave.

The nurse saw her and rushed over.

"Ms. Windsor, where are you going? You can't leave."

Christina brushed her off. "Don't worry, I'll be back soon."

The nurse had no choice but to report to the doctor.

Christina hailed a cab to Harmony Valley Hospital.

At the nurse's station, she inquired about Jennifer.

"Is there a patient named Jennifer here? Which room is she in?"

The nurse checked. "Fifth floor, VIP room, single occupancy, room eight."

With the room number, Christina hurried to the elevator and up to the room.

Just as she was about to enter, she heard a familiar voice.

It was William.

Why was he here?

She stopped and listened.

Jennifer was crying.

"The doctor said even if it heals, there will be a long scar. Surgery won't easily remove it. What am I going to do?"

William remained silent.

Jennifer sobbed, "William, I've waited for you for so many years. If it weren't for Christina, we would have been married by now, maybe even had a cute child. Now my face is ruined. Will you still want me?"

William's voice was cold and calm, like still water without a ripple.

"I won't reject you because of your face."

What he should reject was her heart, so ugly.

Jennifer cried harder, trying to throw herself into his arms for comfort, but William stepped away.

"Focus on healing."

He would deal with the rest later.

Christina couldn't take it anymore. She pushed the door open and walked in quickly.

"William, you really disappoint me."

William was surprised to see her. "Christina, what are you doing here?"

Christina pointed at Jennifer on the bed, her voice cold. "Aren't you going to explain? She's the one who kidnapped Harper. Why is she here instead of at the police station?"

"Calm down." William grabbed her wrist. "Let's talk outside."

"Why should I leave? Jennifer, where is my Harper?" Christina shouted, her emotions running high.

###chapter 244 Questioning

Jennifer's face, half-covered in gauze, was a mix of fear and innocence. "What are you talking about? I don't get it!"

"Cut the act! You were the one who lured me to the South Star Scrap Factory, right? You know so much about Harper's kidnapping; you must be involved. Spill the truth, or I'll kill you, even if it means dying with you."

Christina was so agitated she looked ready to charge forward.

William held her back. "Christina, calm down."

"Calm down? How can I calm down?" Christina's eyes were red with anger as she glared at him. "You never cared about Harper. I should never have trusted you. Let me go, let me go!"

She was using so much strength that her breathing became more and more labored, almost to the point of suffocation.

William grew increasingly worried.

"Christina, let me take you to get some help. You can't get worked up right now. We can talk about everything else later, okay?"

Christina shoved him away. "Stop pretending to be the good guy. You're always taking her side. I was wrong about you, William. I don't need you to find Harper. I'll do it myself!"

With that, she stumbled toward the door, supporting herself against the wall.

William immediately chased after her and scooped her up.

"Now is not the time to be stubborn. I'm taking you back to the hospital."

Christina pounded on his chest, struggling to break free, but his arms were like iron clamps, holding her tightly with no room for escape.

Silent tears streamed down her face.

She had thought that William's affection for Harper and their good relationship would bring them closer, that Harper would finally have the father he always dreamed of.

But she was wrong.

She should never have placed her hopes on William!

He was a complete monster. In their past life, he had ignored Harper's well-being for Jennifer's child. How could he change so easily in this life?

Overwhelmed by sadness, the string in her heart snapped, and she fainted.

William rushed her back to the hospital at top speed.

The doctors, already aware of the situation, quickly wheeled her into the emergency room for treatment. William sat outside, his mind in turmoil.

He hadn't kept Jennifer around out of any lingering sympathy.

He wanted to find Harper, and Jennifer was the only lead. He knew her well enough to believe that handing her over to the police wouldn't be as effective as investigating her himself.

He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.

After a while, the emergency room door opened, and the doctor came out, removing his mask and nodding slightly. "The patient is fine, just a bit emotionally distressed."

William let out a quiet sigh of relief.

"Please take good care of her."

"Of course," the doctor and nurses replied before hurrying away.

Before leaving, William called Bob.

"Send a few people to the hospital. I have something to take care of. Don't let Christina leave until I get back, and have some skilled people on standby."

Bob responded immediately, "Got it, Mr. Cavendish!"

William left the hospital and headed straight to Jennifer's room.

She sat on the bed, staring sadly out the window. The sky was already dark, and only a few reflections of light were visible outside.

Hearing footsteps behind her, Jennifer turned around.

"I thought you weren't coming back today."

William looked at her coldly. "Enough with the games. Tell me, where is Harper?"

Jennifer's face showed a flicker of shock.

"What do you mean? You don't believe me either?"

William said nothing, just stared at her with icy eyes.

Jennifer gave a bitter smile. "I didn't do anything. I can't believe you think I would hurt someone. How could I?"

"Then why were you at the South Star Scrap Factory? Don't tell me you were looking for inspiration for your designs." William's eyes bore into hers.

Jennifer swallowed nervously under his gaze but quickly calmed down, wiping away her tears as she cried. "I was tricked into going there. If I had known, I wouldn't have gone. My face, my face is ruined."

She cried loudly, genuinely distressed.

This time, she wasn't acting. She truly felt regret.

She had once been proud of her face, but when the doctor told her it could never be restored, she wished she could die.

But she couldn't bear to leave William, the man she loved deeply. She hoped he would marry her out of pity.

But William wasn't someone who could be easily threatened.

William leaned on the bed, staring into her tear-filled eyes, and sneered. "Do you know why I didn't hand you over to the police?"

"I wouldn't be afraid even if you did!" Jennifer retorted stubbornly. "I was tricked into going there. I have proof. It's Christina who should be held responsible for my disfigurement."

She pulled out her phone and opened her messages.

Sure enough, there was a message inviting her to the South Star Scrap Factory before the incident.

She had thought that if she were caught, she could use this message to clear her name. She hadn't expected to use it in front of William.

William knocked the phone out of her hand.

"I knew you'd be prepared. I didn't hand you over to the police because I want to deal with you myself. The police follow the law, but I have my own methods. You can try me."

Hearing this, Jennifer's heart sank.

But she wouldn't give up easily, looking at him with tearful eyes.

"I don't know anything about what you're saying. Why do you think I would do such a thing? Did Christina tell you? She's framing me!"

William watched her performance calmly.

"Jennifer, I tolerated you because you once saved me. But this is different. Children are my bottom line. Your disfigurement is just the beginning. If you keep resisting, it won't just be you; your family will be next."

###chapter 245 This Business is a Win-Win

Jennifer listened to his calm, almost serene tone, but her heart was pounding with fear. He always talked about such horrifying things so casually.

She barely moved her lips.

"William, are you threatening me?" Jennifer's voice shook. She tried to keep it together, but the fear in her eyes was obvious.

William stayed indifferent. "Threatening? No, just stating a fact. We don't have a choice here. Either you help me find Harper, or you lose everything. It's up to you."

Tears welled up in Jennifer's eyes again.

But her answer didn't change. She shook her head, looking pitiful with her tear-streaked face.

"I don't know, I really don't. Even if you kill me, I wouldn't know because I've never done anything like that."

William sneered at her.

"Don't make me find out the truth."

Jennifer bit her lip hard.

Did he care about that child so much?

She had thought that selling the child to someone else might give her a chance at a peaceful life. But now, she suddenly didn't want that child to live.

If that child stayed in this world and was found one day, she would undoubtedly become a bond between William and Christina again.

This was something Jennifer absolutely did not want to see. Her face was already ruined; she had nothing left to lose. Now, she could only fight to the end.

William didn't stay long. After warning her, he left. Jennifer took a deep breath and used a secret phone to call the two traffickers.

It took a while for the trafficker to answer. She calmly asked, "Where's the kid now?"

"The kid's been taken out. We're getting ready to sell her. Don't worry, she'll be sold far away," the trafficker said with a happy laugh.

The trafficker had shown Harper to several people, all of whom said she was beautiful and could fetch a high price.

Initially, the trafficker planned to sell Harper to a family to be raised as a daughter. But seeing how valuable she was, he wanted to try a bigger, darker market.

Who knows where the kid would end up then!

Jennifer's face was cold. "I'll give you more money. Kill the kid."

"What?" The trafficker couldn't believe his ears. "Why the sudden change of heart? And killing? I don't dare kill anyone!"

Jennifer let out a cold laugh. "Stop pretending. You've trafficked so many kids. On the road, some must have been disobedient. With such long journeys, do you think I believe your hands are clean?"

The trafficker sighed. "But this kid is valuable. She can fetch a high price."

"Don't ruin my big plan for a small profit," Jennifer said coldly. "I'll give you a large sum, more than you'd make selling the kid."

Hearing this, the trafficker hesitated and then nodded. "Alright."

After hanging up, he turned to look at Harper, who was sleeping on the bed. She had been restless for a day and a night and had just fallen asleep.

He reached out to strangle her but found himself hesitating. She looked so pitiful.

Just then, the door opened, and another woman walked in.

"What are you doing? I heard you on the phone. Who were you talking to?"

The man immediately stood up.

"It was the employer checking in."

"We've already kidnapped the kid. If the employer calls, don't answer unless necessary. She can send the final payment directly," the woman said cautiously.

The man nodded. "I know, but the employer has a new request. She wants us to kill the kid and will pay extra."

The woman raised an eyebrow. "Why the sudden change of heart?"

"I didn't ask, but I thought if we could make more money, why not? This kid seems smart. What if she remembers us later?" The man pulled out a knife from his waist.

"Let's kill her!"

The woman slapped him on the head.

"What are you thinking? How can we kill her? Do you know how valuable she is?"

The man winced in pain.

"But selling her takes time and effort. Killing her would be easier. We could bury the body and disappear for a while."

"Dane found someone willing to pay a million dollars for this kid. Can she offer that?" The woman rolled her eyes. "But I have a plan that can give us the best of both worlds."

The man leaned in eagerly. "What plan?"

"We'll tell the employer the kid is dead, then sell her. We'll get the money from both. After this, we can lay low for a few years, just as the police are closing in."

The woman squinted, looking ruthless.

The man gave a thumbs up. "Red, you always have a plan."

Red smirked. "You're still green. Learn from me. Go get some pig's blood."

She pulled out a knife as she spoke.

The man left and soon returned with a large basin of pig's blood.

Red used the back of the knife to smear blood on Harper, making it look like she was covered in wounds. It was a gruesome sight.

Harper, having taken some sedatives, didn't struggle. Finally, Red took a blunt knife, removed the blade, and placed the handle on Harper's chest.

After finishing, Red stood back, admiring her work. "Perfect. Now take pictures and send them to her for the money!"

The man nodded, took out his phone, and snapped a few photos.

"Looks real enough. I'll send them over, and we'll get the money!"

Red watched him work and urged, "Hurry up. We still need to take the kid to meet the buyer."

She left after saying this.

The man rubbed his hands, edited the photos, and sent them.

When Jennifer saw the photos, she finally felt relieved.

Good, if they all wanted to push her, they shouldn't blame her for being ruthless. Without this kid, let's see what Christina and the others would do.

She quickly used an anonymous phone to send the photos to Christina!

Christina woke up from a nightmare. The room was silent, the night deepening. A clock by the bed ticked away.

It was already past two in the morning.

###chapter 246  False Testimony

Christina struggled to sit up, the pain in her heart overwhelming as she recalled what had just happened.

At that moment, someone outside heard the commotion and quickly walked in. "Ms. Windsor, you're awake?"

Christina looked up and saw it was Bob.

She gave a faint smile. "Four years and you're still by his side. Nothing's changed."

"Mr. Cavendish has been a great benefactor to me. Of course, I stay by his side. How are you feeling, Ms. Windsor? Should I call a doctor to check on you?" Bob asked gently.

Christina waved her hand dismissively. "No need, I'm feeling much better now. I need to go to the police station to find out what's going on!"

Bob hesitated, then looked troubled. "I'm sorry, Ms. Windsor, but Mr. Cavendish instructed that if you woke up, you should stay in the hospital and not wander around."

"What do you mean?" Christina suddenly stood up. "Is he trying to keep me under house arrest? Does he know how worried I am about my missing child? What is he trying to do?"

Bob replied solemnly, "You misunderstand Mr. Cavendish. He's concerned about your health and wants you to receive proper treatment. As for the child, he has made arrangements."

Christina let out a bitter laugh. "Him? It's a miracle if he's not helping the culprit. How could he possibly help me?"

She stumbled as she got up, ready to leave.

Bob immediately reached out to block her path. "Ms. Windsor, I'm sorry, but you can't leave!"

Christina didn't expect this and was instantly furious. She pulled out her phone. "Do you believe I'll call the police and report you for unlawful detention?"

Bob was in a difficult position. William hadn't given instructions for this scenario, and he couldn't just snatch the phone from her.

As Christina unlocked her phone and was about to dial, she suddenly saw a strange message.

She remembered that the person who kidnapped Harper had sent her a message before, telling her to go to that abandoned steel factory. Maybe this was another trick. She opened the message, and what she saw made her gasp for air.

It was a photo of Harper, bloodied and battered, looking horrific.

She almost dropped her phone in shock.

After a long moment, she found her voice, trembling as she spoke to Bob. "Take me to the police station, now."

Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.

Bob initially didn't want to agree, but when he saw the content on her phone, he was also shocked and quickly nodded. "Alright, I'll take you to the police station."

At the station, she immediately sought out the detective in charge.

The detective sighed when he saw her. "We have some leads. We're working hard on it and should have more information soon."

Christina couldn't focus on his words. She was in a daze, feeling like her soul was slipping away.

"Look at this photo."

The detective took her phone, and his expression changed dramatically when he saw the image. "What's going on here?"

"I just woke up and saw this photo. Is my daughter already dead? What should I do? Where do I find her?" Christina was on the verge of tears.

The detective tried to comfort her. "Don't worry, we'll analyze this photo in our tech department to understand the situation. Please try to stay calm."

Christina felt like she was on the brink of madness, teetering on the edge.

"How can I not be worried? My daughter... she hasn't even had a chance to enjoy life. I finally got her back, and now she's being taken from me again. Why is fate so cruel?"

She sobbed uncontrollably.

William arrived after hearing the news. When he saw the photo, he was stunned.

"Christina..."

Christina looked at him with red, tear-filled eyes, full of hatred. "This is all your fault. Didn't you say you'd find Harper if I stayed in the hospital? Is this what you call helping?"

William didn't know how to explain. "I was only trying to find Harper, which is why I went to Jennifer."

"You think I'll believe your lies? William, you're not trustworthy." Christina was in agony. She turned to the detective. "I need to tell you something."

She recounted the message she received and the trip to South Star Scrap Factory, including her encounter with Jennifer and her suspicion that Jennifer was behind it all.

The detective's face changed. "She is indeed a prime suspect. Where is she now? We need to bring her in for questioning. You should have told us this earlier."

Christina glanced at William. "I didn't tell you sooner because of him!"

William pressed his lips together, remaining silent.

Jennifer was quickly brought to the station. Sitting in the interrogation room behind a glass window, Christina wanted to tear her apart.

Her Harper was so young, having barely begun to experience life. If not for the drive for revenge, Christina might not have been able to hold on.

She clenched her fists, watching the police interrogate Jennifer.

The female officer opened the interrogation record, her face expressionless. "Why did you go to South Star Scrap Factory that day?"

Jennifer looked up. "Someone sent me a message, telling me to go there."

"For what reason?" the officer pressed.

Jennifer let out a bitter laugh. "The person said they could help me win William's heart back."

"And you went for that?" The officer was incredulous. "Just for that reason?"

Jennifer's eyes bore into the officer's, her voice hauntingly soft. "Have you ever loved someone? When you love someone deeply enough, you won't give up on even the slightest hope, even if it's false."

The officer coughed. "Alright, back to the matter at hand. Even if you were tricked into going there, why did you attack Ms. Windsor?"

"I thought she was behind it," Jennifer lied without blinking. "I wanted to confront her and take her to the police, but she fought back and disfigured me. You should arrest her, not me!"

###chapter 247 Harper's Phone Call

William knew that someone as cunning as her would first think of making excuses when faced with such a situation.

Things were exactly as he had imagined, and there was no evidence to support many of the claims. In other words, if she didn't admit it herself, there was nothing they could do to her!

The female officer frowned. "You haven't even explained your own situation clearly. Don't talk about anything else. And your face is disfigured. Let me see what it looks like!"

Jennifer immediately lowered her head, covering her face with the bandages.

"No, you can't look!"

"What's there to hide?" The female officer's tone became stern. "This is all evidence related to the case. We have the right to examine it."

Jennifer's body trembled, and she slowly removed the bandages from her face. The wound had been stitched up, and a long scar, like a centipede, crawled across her cheek, making it a shocking sight.

Even the seasoned female officer was taken aback, covering her mouth in surprise.

Seeing the officer's reaction, Jennifer's whole body shook, and she began to sob uncontrollably. "I've already ended up like this, and you still suspect me? Do you think I would gamble with my own face, with the rest of my life? You're being too cruel!"

With that, she collapsed onto the table, crying pitifully, looking as innocent as could be.

Christina wasn't buying it. She wanted to cry too, but it was as if her tears had dried up. Her eyes were sore and dry, and she couldn't squeeze out a single tear.

She desperately wanted to rush into the interrogation room and ask Jennifer what was going on, but before she could act, someone stopped her.

The captain invited her to the conference room.

"Let's not look for now, Ms. Windsor. You're very emotional right now. Please take a moment to rest."

"How can I rest? Every time I close my eyes, all I see is Harper." Christina said in agony. "Is my daughter really dead? How is the investigation going? This must be Jennifer's doing. Ask her where my daughter is."

She was crying uncontrollably.

Seeing this, those around her were moved to tears as well. The captain comforted her, saying, "We're investigating. Don't worry. Based on the photos, it seems they were taken at night, probably not long before they were sent. We've checked, and since Jennifer's disfigurement, she's been in the hospital receiving treatment and hasn't had the opportunity to contact Harper."

"Could she have an accomplice?" Christina grabbed his arm. "The person who kidnapped my child that day wasn't Jennifer. The height doesn't match. Did Jennifer hire someone?"

"We don't have evidence of that. We're investigating." The captain spread his hands.

"You're always investigating, but have you found any clues?" Christina was on the verge of breaking down, shouting hysterically.

The captain understood her emotions and comforted her before saying, "Don't worry. No matter what, we will find the real culprit."

The police kept repeating the same thing, and Christina was exhausted.

Every moment she lived in this world was painful.

She waved her hand and got up to leave. William was already gone, and Bob came to meet her.

"Ms. Windsor, let me take you home to rest. Mr. Cavendish has found some leads and is following up. Don't worry, he'll bring Harper back to you."

Christina looked up tearfully. "Do you believe his nonsense?"

Bob was taken aback, cleared his throat, and said solemnly, "Of course, I always believe Mr. Cavendish."

"Yeah, you've been with him for so long, you only believe him. But I warn you, this is the police station. Don't mess around. I'm not going with you." Christina glared at him and walked out quickly.

As she was about to hail a cab to go home, she suddenly received a call from Kaitlyn.

"Christina, is everything resolved?"

Christina forced a bitter smile, trying to steady her emotions. "Not yet."

"Is it serious? Do you need me to come to you?" Kaitlyn asked with concern.

Christina felt exhausted. "I'm fine."

Kaitlyn could tell she didn't want to talk much, so she smiled lightly. "Alright, if you need anything, let me know. Did I help you last time? Irvin helped me investigate."

Christina suppressed her emotions. "Yes, you did. Thank you. Please thank Irvin for me. Once this is over, I'll treat you both to dinner."

"That's good!" Kaitlyn sighed in relief.

After hanging up, Christina saw a cab approaching and waved it down.

As she got in and was about to close the door, Bob suddenly appeared and sat down next to her.

Christina looked at him incredulously. "What do you want?"

"Ms. Windsor, I can't let you go back to the hospital, but I can't leave you alone either. Let me stay with you. I can help if anything happens." Bob said sincerely.

Christina took a deep breath. "Do whatever you want."

The car started moving.

Christina looked out the window, her mood hitting rock bottom.

Just then, her phone rang again. She picked it up, thinking it might be the kidnappers with new demands, and answered immediately.

"Hello!"

To her surprise, it was Harper's voice.

"Mom, it's me. I'm so scared. I don't know where I am. It's very rundown here. I managed to escape and am hiding in a place full of junk."

Christina couldn't believe her ears. The moment she heard Harper's voice, tears streamed down her face.

"Harper, is it really you?"

Harper cried. "Mom, when are you coming to get me?"

Christina quickly said, "I'm coming right now. Don't cry. Mommy will be there soon."

Harper nodded. "There's a small store here. The old lady can't hear well, but she let me use the phone."

Harper was very scared.

She couldn't trust anyone.

"Harper, you're a brave girl. You have to do what I say. Hang up my call and dial 911. The police will find your location. Then call me back. Mommy will stay with you, okay?"

Although she wanted to find Harper herself, the police had more resources, possibly advanced tracking systems, and manpower. Letting the police know Harper's location wasn't a bad idea.

###chapter 248  Lost and Found

She had already left the police station, and going back would take too much time.

Harper agreed!

After hanging up, Christina immediately called the police captain handling the case.

Once she explained the situation, the captain quickly responded, "Ms. Windsor, don't worry. We'll coordinate with the emergency system to locate your child."

Christina let out a small sigh of relief.

With the police involved, they would surely find the child soon.

"We'll connect you to your child's phone once we get through. You don't need to worry," the captain confirmed after checking with the tech department.

Christina felt much calmer, waiting quietly for the police to connect her call with Harper. With her on the line, Harper wouldn't be as scared.

After a while, the call connected. Christina immediately said, "Harper, Mommy will come to get you soon. Don't be afraid, just stay hidden."

"Okay!" Harper replied.

Christina kept talking to Harper, hoping her voice would provide some comfort.

But unexpectedly, a few minutes later, Harper's voice turned fearful again.

"Mommy, the people who kidnapped me are back. It's not safe here. I need to hide."

As soon as Harper finished speaking, the line went dead.

Christina's heart clenched.

"Harper? Harper!"

No response.

In a dim alley, Red looked around and cursed at the man.

"What were you doing? How could you let a child escape?"

"Who knew she would lie?" The man bit his lip. "Don't worry, this place is in the countryside, surrounded by wasteland. She can't get far. She's just a kid; she can't fly away."

"She might not get far, but if something happens, our cash cow is gone. Are you going to compensate for that?" Red glared at him.

The man sighed. "Yes, yes, my fault. Let's find her quickly. If we can't, we'll call Dane back."

Red ignored him and walked briskly. Many people had moved out of the alley, leaving many empty houses. They searched each one until they found a small shop.

An old lady sat inside, fanning herself.

Red walked over quickly and asked gently, "Ma'am, have you seen a little girl? Our daughter is lost, and we're very worried."

The old lady couldn't hear them and just pointed to her ear, shaking her head to indicate she was deaf.

Red raised her voice and repeated the question.

The old lady still couldn't hear.

Frustrated, Red was about to leave when she noticed an old-fashioned phone on the table, with the receiver off the hook.

She squinted and picked up the phone to listen.

No sound.

But if the old lady was deaf, how could she make a call? Could it be the little girl?

That little girl was not only pretty but also smart. She could fetch a good price!

"She's ahead. Keep going," Red said, narrowing her eyes and running forward.

The man quickly followed.

Harper looked around, panicked. Seeing them search each house, she didn't dare hide in the abandoned homes.

She ran until she reached an open area with a large patch of wasteland.

Harper gritted her teeth and hid in the tall grass, covering her mouth, not daring to make a sound.

Red and her men were getting closer.

"Harper, I know you're here. Come out, okay? I won't hurt you. I'll take you to eat delicious food. Just come out, okay?"

Her voice was like a ghost, slowly approaching.

Christina knew something was wrong and couldn't sit still.

She immediately called the police again, asking for their location so she could rush over.

A child that young needed her mother. The captain understood and told her the location, suggesting, "Why don't you wait, and we'll go together?"

Christina checked the map. The place was far.

But she couldn't wait.

She had to go first.

The abandoned old town would take time for the police to reach, but Red heard sirens in the distance.

"Damn, we've been found."

The man, out of breath, asked, "What do we do?"

"Run first. We won't make much from this job. Let's go, we can't get caught." Red gritted her teeth. "I won't let that little girl go. She's ruined so many of my plans."

The man nodded. "Just leave?"

Red squinted. "You reminded me. We can't let her live, or she'll expose us. She must be hiding in this wasteland. Beyond it is open land; she can't get that far. Set the grass on fire."

The man sneered. "Alright, I'll burn it!"

He took out a lighter and walked towards the grass. Harper, hiding in the grass, felt the heat rising behind her. Her heart pounded, and tears streamed down her face.

She knew if she didn't escape, the fire would consume her.

"Mommy, what should I do?" Harper cried softly, her voice carried away by the wind, with no response.

Meanwhile, Christina had taken a cab to Harper's location. Her anxiety was like ants on a hot pan. She kept urging the driver to speed up and called the police for updates.

The police reassured her they had located the area and were organizing a search.

But time was running out. She couldn't wait!

When she arrived, the grass was already ablaze.

Christina felt a sudden, ominous premonition and shouted, "Harper, where are you?"

The police had called the fire department, who began extinguishing the fire.

In the vast wasteland, the fire spread quickly with the wind, and Harper was nowhere to be seen.

Christina felt like she was hearing a ringing in her ears, her head buzzing, unable to think clearly.

Just then, a clear voice called from behind her, "Mommy."

Christina thought she was hearing things. She turned around in disbelief and saw her daughter standing not far away.

###chapter 249 Released Due to Lack of Evidence

Her face was streaked with ash, a clear sign she had just escaped from a fire. Standing next to her was William, holding her small hand. He only let go when she reached out for her mom.

Harper ran towards her, throwing herself into her arms, crying her heart out.

"Mom, I missed you so much. I was so scared. I thought I'd never see you again."

"It's okay, Harper! Mommy's here." Christina felt a wave of relief, holding her tightly.

Harper continued to cry, the fear still clinging to her.

Christina hugged her even tighter. "I won't let you out of my sight again!"

After calming down a bit, Harper turned to look at William. "We have to thank Dad Cavendish too. I was hiding in the bushes, and those bad guys tried to set the dry grass on fire to burn me. I was too scared to come out, but Dad Cavendish showed up with some people and saved me."

"Really?" Christina gently stroked her hair. "It's okay now. Mommy's taking you home."

Christina led Harper to the police car, making sure she was settled before turning to William. "Thank you for this."

Despite her deep dislike for William, she had to acknowledge that he had saved her child.

William smiled. "It was nothing. I had to do it. Harper is my child too."

Christina didn't want to hear this. She suddenly felt that bringing Harper back to the country might have been a mistake.

Although the overall social environment here was safer than abroad, many people she knew had some connection to her.

The situation with the Cavendish family was complicated, and she feared similar incidents might happen again.

"William, let me make this clear. Harper is my child and has nothing to do with you. Stop wasting your efforts."

William argued, "A child needs a father."

Christina scoffed, "But not you."

"Then who do you want my child to call father?" William's eyes narrowed dangerously.

"That's none of your business," Christina replied calmly.

William lost his temper and grabbed her wrist tightly, his eyes narrowing.

"Christina, I won't allow this to happen."

"You have no right to say that. Let go of me!" Christina shook off his hand, coldly got into the car, and closed her eyes in pain.

The captain was tracking the suspects through online surveillance.

After organizing his team, he turned back. "Is the child hurt? Do you need to go to the hospital, or should we go to the station to get a detailed statement?"

Christina wanted to take Harper home to rest and deal with everything tomorrow. But Harper, showing unexpected bravery, said, "Mom, I'm okay. I can tell the police what happened."

Christina felt a surge of pride and relief. Her daughter, though young, had the courage to face difficulties. She gently patted Harper's shoulder, encouraging her.

"Alright, Harper, tell the police what happened." Christina turned to the captain. "We'll head to the station."

At the station, Harper, guided by the captain, recounted her kidnapping ordeal in detail.

That painful memory was crucial to finding the kidnappers!

After finishing, Harper asked with wide eyes, "Will this really help catch them?"

The captain nodded. "Absolutely, Harper. You were very brave. We'll find them."

The captain left, and a police officer approached. "They got away, but based on the kidnapping method and situation, it might be a human trafficking gang operating in nearby states."

The captain flipped through the statements. "Do we have the main suspects? Get the sketch artist. The victim has seen them."

"Can a child really give an accurate description?" The officer was doubtful.

Often, children's memories were unreliable because they couldn't systematically record what they saw.

The captain sighed. "Let's try."

As the officer was about to leave, he remembered something and turned back.

"By the way, Jennifer's detention time is almost up. Should we let her go? We don't have a reason to keep her."

"Follow the procedure. Without evidence, we can't hold her." The captain waved him off.

Christina waited, feeling a mix of emotions. She was relieved Harper was safe but worried about the future. The kidnappers were still at large, and Harper's safety wasn't fully assured.

After signing the statement as Harper's guardian, Christina prepared to leave.

Outside the meeting room, she overheard officers discussing releasing Jennifer.

The captain came out of an interrogation room and approached Christina.

"Ms. Windsor, we've created sketches of the kidnappers based on Harper's description. We'll post them online and increase surveillance in the area to find them quickly."

Christina nodded, knowing this was the best the police could do.

She wanted to ask about Jennifer's release. Why was she being let go so soon?

She brought it up.

The captain sighed. "We don't have enough evidence to prove Jennifer's involvement in the kidnapping, so we have to release her. But we'll keep monitoring her, and if we find anything suspicious, we'll act immediately."

Christina took a deep breath. She knew the police's assurances wouldn't ease her worries, but she understood the need for proper procedure.

"Alright, I'll take Harper home now. Please call me if there's any news."

Christina handed the captain a note with her phone number and left the station with Harper.

On the way home, Harper clung to Christina's hand, her face still showing traces of fear. Christina's heart ached with guilt and sorrow, knowing the kidnapping had deeply traumatized her daughter.

Back home, Christina immediately prepared some warm water to clean Harper up, then gave her a bath and dressed her in clean clothes.

###chapter 250 Restricted from Leaving the Country

Harper's emotions gradually stabilized, but she still seemed a bit fragile.

On the way, Christina made a decision: "Harper, how about we go abroad for a while?"

Harper climbed out of bed. "But we just got back, Mom. I just made so many new friends at kindergarten. I like it here."

Maybe it was her attachment to her hometown, something Christina hadn't anticipated.

She pursed her lips. "How about this? We'll go abroad for a few months, and then we'll come back."

"Mom, are you worried those traffickers might come after me again?" Harper's big eyes blinked innocently.

Despite her young age, she understood a lot.

Christina nodded. "Yes, I am worried."

Harper thought for a moment and agreed.

"Okay, I'll go with you."

Christina breathed a sigh of relief. Maybe they shouldn't have come back in the first place.

The next day, she temporarily put her work on hold and started the process of applying to go abroad.

Unexpectedly, just as everything seemed to be going smoothly, the staff suddenly told her, "Ms. Windsor, your paperwork is fine, but there's an issue with your daughter's. She can't leave the country for the next six months."

"How can that be? We just came back not long ago without any problems." Christina wanted to see what the issue was.

But the staff quickly covered the computer screen, giving an awkward smile. "Sorry, Ms. Windsor, this is confidential."

Christina's eyes narrowed as she thought for a moment. "I don't know if immigration has such rules, but I know someone who might be able to help."

"What?" The staff didn't understand her implication.

Christina's eyes narrowed further as she stared at the staff's face. "Is William Cavendish behind this?"

The staff's face turned pale but quickly recovered, forcing a smile. "How could that be? We don't engage in under-the-table operations here."

"Your reaction already gave me the answer. Thank you." Christina's eyes narrowed.

The staff seemed afraid of losing their job and quickly said, "Our actions are in line with regulations. Complaining won't help."

"I won't complain. I'll go straight to the person behind this." Christina left quickly.

The staff let out a long sigh of relief.

Christina called William, but he didn't answer, seemingly on purpose.

She decided to try her luck at William's old villa, unsure if he still lived there.

When she arrived, the door was open, and the place was empty.

"William!"

She called out.

Just then, footsteps echoed from the stairs. She looked up to see William coming down.

"What's going on? Harper can't leave the country. Did you do this?"

William looked down with a bitter smile. "You finally brought the child back to me. How could I let you leave? Even if you hate me, I had to do this. Once you're abroad, finding you would be like searching for a needle in a haystack."

Christina was livid.

"What gives you the right to control my life? I'm taking Harper abroad for work."

"Fine, you can leave Harper with me. I'll have bodyguards protect her 24/7. Nothing will happen to her, and I'll let you go." William's eyes locked onto hers.

He clearly didn't believe Christina's reason for leaving was work-related.

He feared that once she left, she might never return.

"William, I won't leave Harper with you. I won't let my daughter be in danger." Christina's voice was firm and cold.

She would never forget how William had treated Harper. Even though their lives had changed, her deep-seated hatred for him remained.

William felt a pang of hurt, forcing a smile after a long pause.

"I don't care if you hate me. I will protect Harper with my life."

Christina was taken aback by his words. Reflecting on his actions, it was true that he had saved Harper from several dangers since their return.

For a moment, she wondered if her prejudice against him was too deep to overcome.

But then she remembered Jennifer. No matter what, Jennifer would always be his priority, even over his own daughter.

"Do as you please." Christina took a deep breath, looking at him coldly. "Six months isn't a long time. Once it's over, I doubt you can stop me. William, I just want to be strangers."

She turned and left without a second thought.

William stood on the stairs, his heart aching, his chest wound throbbing.

He lifted his shirt to check the burn, which had turned redder. Burns were indeed the most painful. At the time, it hadn't seemed like much, but now, sweating made it almost unbearable.

He forced himself up and returned to his room.

Back home, Christina was visited by Kaitlyn, who brought bags of toys. "Look, all for Harper."

"Thanks." Christina glanced at the toys, all things Harper liked.

Harper rushed out of her room, excited. "Thank you, Ms. Fisher. Are these to cheer me up?"

"Cheer you up? What do you mean?" Kaitlyn was confused.

Harper explained, "I was kidnapped a few days ago. I barely escaped. Mom and Dad Cavendish saved me."

Kaitlyn was stunned, her first reaction to scold Christina. "Really? You didn't tell me any of this when you asked for my help. So much happened!"

"I didn't want you to worry." Christina said apologetically.

Kaitlyn turned away, pretending to be upset.

"Sorry, Kaitlyn. I'll tell you everything next time." Christina quickly apologized.

Kaitlyn turned back, smiling. "I'm just kidding. You always handle everything on your own, no wonder you're single."

Christina laughed awkwardly. "What's wrong with being single? It's great."

Then she changed the subject.

"Are you talking about being single so much because you want a boyfriend?"

###chapter 251 I Just Want Her to Pay the Price

"No way," Kaitlyn said with a smirk. "I just think you and Harper could use a guy around."

Christina chuckled. "I don't need one. I can handle things just fine."

Kaitlyn moved closer, her smile widening. "How about I introduce you to a few guys? Irvin's a great guy, and anyone he knows can't be too bad."

"Cut it out," Christina said, rolling her eyes. "I'm not interested right now. I just want to raise Harper healthy and happy. But you keep praising Irvin-do you like him?"

"Yeah, I do," Kaitlyn admitted, her eyes softening. "It's different from my first crush. It's more like a thoughtful, grown-up kind of love."

Christina laughed at her description. "So, when are you two taking the next step?"

"I told you, I need love to spice up my marriage. I'm still not sure he's the one," Kaitlyn sighed, clearly uncertain.

Christina reassured her, "It's okay, everyone grows. Take it one step at a time. You're still young."

"True!" Kaitlyn agreed, nodding.

Just then, Kaitlyn's phone rang. It was Irvin.

"Kaitlyn, I have a few opera tickets. I heard you like opera. Want to go?"

Kaitlyn covered the phone and looked at Christina. "He invited me to the opera. Want to come? I can ask if he has an extra ticket."

Christina shook her head vigorously. "No, thanks. I want to stay home with Harper. Besides, I'd just be in the way."

Kaitlyn playfully glared at her. "Nonsense, you wouldn't be in the way. You're my emotional advisor."

"I can't do that job. Count me out," Christina said with a calm smile.

Kaitlyn laughed heartily and returned to her call. "Alright, I'll go with you."

Irvin laughed too, playing along. "Thank you, Miss Fisher. See you tomorrow afternoon. After the opera, let's grab dinner."

"Sounds good," Kaitlyn agreed easily.

After hanging up, she played with Harper for a while before leaving.

Since the kidnapper hadn't been caught, Christina didn't feel safe sending Harper to preschool. She took time off work to stay home with Harper.

Harper was getting bored and asked, "Mom, when can I go back to preschool?"

Christina patted Harper's head. "In a little while, okay?"

Harper pouted but agreed. "Then I want your best shrimp dish."

"Alright," Christina said, tapping Harper's nose. "Mom will make it for you."

As she was preparing the ingredients, there was a knock at the door.

Harper remembered her mom's rule about not opening the door alone and called out, "Mom, someone's here."

Christina wiped her hands on her apron and went to the door, peeking through the peephole.

It was William.

She didn't want to deal with him, but then William picked up a child next to him-it was Isaac. Isaac smiled brightly. "Ms. Windsor, I'm here to play with Harper!"

Christina didn't want to let William in, but she couldn't turn away a child. After some thought, she opened the door.

Isaac handed her a small bouquet. "Ms. Windsor, sorry to bother you. I brought you a gift."

Christina couldn't resist the sweet child. She patted Isaac's head. "Why did you suddenly want to play with Harper?"

"Harper is my best friend at preschool. I haven't seen her in days. I miss her," Isaac said openly.

Harper jumped off the couch, excitedly running to Isaac. "You're here to see me! Great!"

Isaac took her hand, smiling. "Everyone at school hopes you come back soon."

"I know, but I can't go back yet," Harper said, then took him to show her new toys, all gifts from Kaitlyn.

Christina blocked William at the door. "This kid isn't yours. You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?"

William cleared his throat, trying to sound serious. "Isaac wanted to see Harper. I know you, so it seemed appropriate. My friend doesn't know you, and it wouldn't be right for a stranger to visit."

Christina inwardly scoffed. She knew William was using this as an excuse to get close to her and Harper, but she couldn't disappoint Isaac.

She stepped aside without a word.

Harper was bragging about her cooking skills, and Isaac was thrilled. "We haven't eaten yet, so we'll join you!"

Christina took a deep breath, suppressing her irritation. "You two play in the living room. No dangerous activities. I'll make dinner."

Isaac nodded eagerly. "Okay."

She went to the kitchen alone, but soon William followed.

Christina glanced at him coolly. "What are you doing here?"

"I'm here to help," William said. "The shrimp isn't cleaned yet. I'll do it."

Christina snatched the bag from him. "I don't need you playing the good guy. You tried to keep Harper and me from leaving the country, and now you're pretending to be nice. No thanks!"

William's movements stiffened. "Christina, let me explain. Jennifer-"

"I don't need your explanations. I know Jennifer saved your life, but I don't care. I just want the kidnapper caught and her identified. I know there's no evidence, and I'm not asking you to do anything, but she will face justice someday."

After saying this coldly, Christina brushed past him and walked out.

"I'm not trying to protect her. Jennifer will pay for what she's done," William promised.

But Christina didn't believe a word.

She prepared some snacks for the kids and told them cheerfully that William would play with them, finally getting some peace in the kitchen.

She started making dinner alone.

###chapter 252 Heimlich Maneuver

William was outside playing with Harper and Isaac.

Seeing the smile on Harper's face, William's heart softened.

If only life could always be this simple and happy.

"This candy is really good, you should try it," Harper said, handing one of the caramels to Isaac.

Isaac unwrapped the candy and popped it into his mouth. His eyes lit up immediately. "Wow! This is really delicious."

"If it wasn't good, I wouldn't have recommended it," Harper said, putting a caramel in her own mouth.

She chatted with Isaac while chewing, but suddenly, the candy got stuck in her throat.

A wave of panic hit her.

Harper tried to cough the candy out, but no matter how hard she tried, it wouldn't budge. Her face turned bright red.

William was the first to notice something was wrong.

He quickly picked Harper up, placed one fist above her belly button, and with his other hand, he pressed upward on her stomach.

Finally, the candy dislodged from Harper's throat.

She took deep breaths, gasping for air.

"Harper, are you okay?" William asked urgently. "Does it still hurt?"

Harper shook her head. "I'm okay now, thanks, Dad Cavendish. I was so scared, I thought I wouldn't see Mom again."

William felt a wave of relief.

Luckily, he had been paying attention and wasn't distracted by something else, or it could have ended badly.

Isaac, still too young to fully understand what had happened, looked concerned and confused. "Harper, what happened?"

"She choked on the candy," William explained, setting Harper down.

He looked seriously at the two kids. "From now on, you need to chew your food slowly and don't talk while eating. Mom's almost done with dinner, so let's put these snacks away for now."

He made a mental note to talk to Christina later about not giving the kids candies or jellies unless an adult was around.

"Okay, I understand," Harper nodded.

Isaac obediently put down his snacks.

William played with them for a while longer until Christina called from the kitchen, "Harper, Isaac, go wash your hands. Dinner's ready."

The kids ran off happily.

William followed Christina into the kitchen, picking up a bowl to help serve the rice. He wanted to do something to help her.

But the next second, Christina took the bowl from his hands.

"I don't need your fake kindness," she said coldly. "The only reason I let you in is because Isaac is here. They're good friends, and I didn't want to ruin Harper's day. Other than that, I don't want to see you at all."

William felt a sharp pain in his heart.

Christina really hated him now.

He knew he hadn't done enough.

"Christina..."

"Don't say my name," she interrupted. "Why don't you go find your precious Jennifer instead of disrupting my and Harper's lives?"

"I'm Harper's biological father, Christina. Harper has been with you all these years, she only has a mother's love, not a father's. And we aren't divorced yet. I have a right to be part of her life."

Christina's face darkened at the mention of custody.

Raising Harper alone all these years, she had thought about this. If William ever tried to take custody from her, she would never give in.

Even if it cost her everything, she would never let William take Harper.

"If you're here to fight for custody, let me tell you, as long as I'm alive, Harper is mine," Christina said firmly.

In their past life, William and Jennifer's entanglement had hurt Harper.

She wouldn't let her daughter go through that again.

William knew she misunderstood. "I'm not here to take her away. I just want to help take care of Harper. A mother can't replace a father's role. A child needs a complete family to grow up healthy."

"You don't deserve to talk about a complete family, William. What responsible father acts like you? What have you ever done for Harper?" Christina struggled to keep her anger in check.

She didn't want the kids outside to hear. Adult issues should be handled by adults. She didn't want to involve the children.

Harper just needed to be happy every day.

"And don't tell me you'll make it up to me. I don't need it. Just stay away from me and the kids. That's the best thing you can do. Today, I let you in for Isaac's sake, but this is the last time."

Before Christina could finish, the kitchen door opened.

Harper peeked in, smiling sweetly. "Mommy, we washed our hands. When can we eat?"

"Right now, as soon as I serve the rice," Christina replied gently to her daughter.

William followed her out of the kitchen.

At the dinner table, neither of them mentioned the earlier tension.

Christina used serving chopsticks to give each child a drumstick. "Eat up, and tell me how Mommy's cooking is."

"Dad Cavendish, you have some too," Harper said, standing up to give William a drumstick.

Christina was momentarily stunned.

Harper was still just a child. She didn't understand everything. Children naturally wanted the love of both parents. It was normal.

Compared to other kids, Harper only had her mom. Christina knew she owed her daughter that.

"Mommy, you have a drumstick too. When I choked on the candy earlier, Dad Cavendish saved me," Harper said, giving Christina a drumstick.

Christina tensed up. "How did you choke? Are you still feeling unwell?"

"It's okay. Once I got the candy out, I felt much better. Don't worry, Mommy, I'm fine now," Harper reassured her with a smile.

Harper and Isaac enjoyed their meal, but the two adults barely touched their food.

Christina had no appetite. Her mind was filled with Harper's earlier words.

Harper had almost choked to death on the candy.

If William hadn't been there...

Christina's feelings towards William were complicated. She disliked him, but he had just saved Harper's life. She had to give him some credit for that.

###chapter 253 I Only Agree to Let Isaac Stay

Soon, the kids were all full.

Harper noticed Christina's bowl was still mostly full and sat up straight. "Mom, why aren't you eating? You gotta eat well to stay healthy. You need to set a good example for me!"

"I already ate earlier, so I'm not really hungry right now. I'll eat again in the morning," Christina fibbed.

She glanced at the clock; it was already past seven. "Isaac, after dinner, you two can watch some TV, and then Mr. Cavendish will take you home. If you stay too late, your parents will worry."

If it were just Isaac, it wouldn't be a big deal for him to stay over. But William was here too. Christina didn't want him staying the night.

Isaac shook his head. "It's okay. Mr. Cavendish already talked to my dad before we came. If we stay late, I won't go home tonight."

William, again! Christina couldn't help but glare at him. He would do anything to stay, even using a child.

"So, can I stay over tonight?" Isaac looked at her with hopeful eyes. "I promise I'll be really good. I'll go to bed early and won't cause any trouble."

Christina hesitated, looking at Isaac's pleading eyes.

Harper gently tugged on her arm, joining in Isaac's plea. "Mom, we were in the middle of playing house. Can we play a little longer, please?"

"Alright," Christina finally nodded.

She had only agreed to let Isaac stay, not William.

After settling the kids, Christina walked over to William. "You can leave now."

"I brought Isaac out, so it's my responsibility to take him back. If he's staying, then I have to stay too," William argued.

He didn't want to leave. Even if it meant just seeing Christina and Harper a little longer, he was willing.

Christina was firm. "Do you think just because the kids get along well, I'll make endless concessions for you?"

"That's not what I meant."

"I don't care what you meant," Christina cut him off. "I won't agree to you staying here. Either you leave, or you take Isaac with you. I'll explain to Harper."

Harper was an understanding child. If Christina explained, she wouldn't throw a tantrum.

As for Isaac, Christina didn't want to disappoint him, but she had no other choice.

William was silent for a moment, then softened his tone. "Christina, you have work and the kids to take care of. I can help with them tonight. Just one night, and I'll take Isaac home tomorrow. I won't overstay my welcome."

"Not even half the night," Christina refused again.

She was resolute and wouldn't change her mind easily.

In the end, William relented. "I'll tell Isaac. I'll leave tonight and come back in the morning to take him to school."

Christina said nothing more.

William went to Harper's room, where the kids were playing on the floor.

They looked up and greeted him as he entered.

"Isaac, you'll stay here tonight. I'll come back in the morning to take you to school," William said, his eyes lingering on Harper.

She was his daughter, so small and adorable.

Isaac nodded. "Got it. See you, Mr. Cavendish."

"Bye, Dad Cavendish," Harper echoed.

After William left, Christina joined the kids for a while, then helped them get ready for bed.

That night, the kids slept soundly.

The next morning, Harper was the first to wake up.

After getting ready, she went to wake Isaac. "Isaac, get up! We don't want to be late for school. Mommy's making breakfast, and Dad Cavendish will be here soon."

Isaac rubbed his sleepy eyes.

He got out of bed, put on his shoes, and yawned as he walked out. "I wish you could come to school with me. We could play together there."

"I want to go to school too. Staying home is so boring. At school, I can play with other kids," Harper sighed.

But her mommy had said she needed to stay home a few more days, so she would.

At least she had her mom with her at home.

"It's okay. I'll wait for you. When you come to school, we can play together," Isaac said, holding out his pinky for a promise.

Christina came up to call them for breakfast and saw this.

She was worried about Harper, which was why she wanted her to rest at home.

But Harper wanted to go to school.

As a mother, she had to respect her child's wishes.

After breakfast, she and Harper walked Isaac out. He waved at them from the car.

William rolled down the window to say goodbye.

Christina responded for the kids' sake. After the car drove off, she told Harper, "Today, we'll visit Grandma. Tomorrow, you can go to school. How does that sound?"

"I can go to school tomorrow? That's great!" Harper was thrilled.

Back home, she quickly changed clothes, and they headed out.

They drove to the hospital. On the way to the room, Christina ran into Elisa's doctor.

"Ms. Windsor, I need to talk to you about your mother's condition," the doctor said seriously.

Christina followed him to his office.

Once the door was closed, the doctor pulled out Elisa's report. "Your mother's condition is very serious. I recommend stopping the chemotherapy."

"But stopping chemo means giving up, doesn't it?" Christina immediately disagreed.

For Elisa, chemo was the only way to control the cancer.

Giving it up meant giving up all treatment.

She couldn't accept that.

The doctor understood. "But Ms. Windsor, chemo itself is very harsh. Your mother can't handle the side effects anymore. Continuing might not be treating her but hastening her death."

###chapter 254 One Month of Life

The office fell silent.

Christina took a deep breath before speaking, her voice shaky. "Doctor, if we stop the chemo now, how long does my mom have?"

"At most, a month," the doctor replied, giving her a grim timeline.

This was way shorter than Christina had expected.

"Doctor, is there any other way to extend her life? Money's not an issue. Whatever treatment might help, I'll do it."

"Ms. Windsor, I understand how you feel. I've considered all options, but given your mom's current condition, there's nothing more we can do. My advice is to make her remaining time as comfortable as possible. Let her eat what she wants and fulfill her wishes."

The doctor was blunt but compassionate.

Elisa's cancer had progressed to a point where money didn't matter anymore. No amount of money could change the outcome.

"I understand. Thank you, doctor." Christina wasn't sure how she made it to the hospital room.

She opened the door and saw Elisa lying in bed, her face pale. The sight made Christina's heart ache even more.

"Christina, come here. Let me take a good look at you," Elisa beckoned her over.

Harper was there too.

Elisa looked at her daughter, then at her granddaughter. "Christina, I know my condition. Just tell me the truth. Do I have much time left?"

"Mom, don't think about that now. Focus on your treatment. We might still beat this," Christina said, not ready to tell her the truth.

She wasn't sure if Elisa could handle it. If Elisa's spirit broke, she might not even last a month.

Elisa smiled. "Don't try to comfort me. I know the reality. If the treatment isn't working, let's stop. It's too painful. Can you grant me one last wish?"

"Tell me," Christina said, tears streaming down her face.

"Spend the rest of the time with me. Let's travel and see the beautiful sights of our country," Elisa said.

Christina agreed.

It was her mother's only wish, and as her daughter, she had to fulfill it. "I'll talk to Harper's teacher and get her a leave of absence. We'll make the most of our time."

Harper listened quietly.

She liked going to preschool, but the idea of traveling with her mom and grandma sounded fun too.

"Harper needs to go to school, and I want you to be with me. Let's just go, the two of us," Elisa said, ruffling Harper's hair.

"Sweetie, tell Grandma. If you had to choose between school and traveling, which would you pick? You're young and will have plenty of chances to travel. This is my only chance to go out with your mom."

Harper understood that her grandma didn't want to take her along.

She answered, "Grandma, you and Mom can go. I'll go to school and play with my friends."

With Harper and Elisa both agreeing, Christina wanted to respect their wishes.

But the problem was, Harper's preschool wasn't a boarding school. Someone needed to take her to and from school.

If Christina traveled with Elisa, who would take care of Harper?

Her first thought was Kaitlyn. Given their relationship, Kaitlyn would surely agree if she asked.

But Kaitlyn was also very busy lately and might not be able to help.

"Christina, are you worried about who will take care of Harper?" Elisa saw through her thoughts.

She held Christina's hand. "Isn't there an obvious choice? Call William and ask him to take care of Harper for a while. He'll definitely agree."

"Mom, I don't want to," Christina started to protest.

Elisa began coughing violently.

Christina had to drop the subject for now. She handed Elisa a tissue and waited for her to finish coughing. When she looked down, she saw blood on the tissue.

Elisa was coughing up blood.

Christina couldn't say anything more. She decided to go along with it for now and figure out another solution later.

But to her surprise, William showed up at the hospital.

He brought supplements that were good for Elisa's health.

"William, I don't have much time left. Before I die, I want Christina to take me traveling," Elisa said. "Can you take care of Harper for a while?"

William agreed immediately.

Christina watched, feeling a deep sense of helplessness.

Even now, Elisa was trying to push her and William together.

But could she argue with someone who was dying?

If she upset Elisa and something happened, she'd never forgive herself.

William could see Christina's reluctance. He pulled her aside and spoke softly. "Christina, Harper is my daughter. I'll take good care of her. I have the ability to do so. If you leave her with someone else, will they care as much as her father? Plus, Harper likes me."

Christina knew he was right. He genuinely wanted to be good to Harper.

But she couldn't forget the past and how he had failed them before.

"I promise I won't fight for custody. Never," William added.

Christina glanced at Elisa and saw the worry on her face.

In the end, she relented. "Take care of Harper for a month. When we get back, remember your promise. Don't interfere in our lives anymore."

"Okay," William agreed.

He cherished every moment with Harper, even if it was just for a month.

After they made the arrangements, Christina took Elisa out of the hospital and booked their flights.

William took Harper home, made her dinner, told her a bedtime story, and put her to bed. The next morning, he took her to preschool.

At the school gate, Harper saw Isaac.

"Harper, you're back!" Isaac was thrilled and ran over to hold her hand. "Let's go in together."

###chapter 255 See What the Kindergarten is Doing

Before heading into school, the two kids turned back to wave at William.

Watching their energetic little figures, William felt that happiness couldn't get any better than this.

For the next few days, he made sure to drop off and pick up Harper every day, and in the evenings, he spent time playing with her.

"Dad, you spend all your time taking care of me. What about your work?" Harper asked curiously, sitting beside him after getting tired from playing.

William gently wiped the sweat from her forehead. "I finish my work during the day at the office, so in the evenings, I can just focus on playing with you."

Harper nodded in understanding.

What she didn't know was that every night after putting her to bed, William would go to his study to work.

He didn't mind at all.

Being able to spend every day with his daughter was a luxury, so staying up a bit later each night was a small price to pay.

Meanwhile, with Christina...

Considering Elisa's poor health, she decided to head south. After landing, they went straight to the hotel, planning to rest for a couple of days before exploring.

"Christina, those years you spent abroad alone, taking care of a child and worrying about finances, must have been exhausting," Elisa said during a casual chat.

As a woman who had also lived alone for a while, Elisa could empathize with the struggle.

Christina just smiled. "Those days are behind me now."

"Harper just started kindergarten. She still has elementary, middle, and college ahead. Your hard times are far from over," Elisa said, looking out the window. "If I were alive, I could help you. But once I'm gone, who will be there for you?"

Raymond treated Christina well, but the problem was that he had a son and a daughter from his previous marriage who didn't like Christina.

While Elisa was alive, they held back a bit. But once she was gone, they would likely rush back to claim the inheritance and push Christina away.

Thinking about this made Elisa anxious.

But there was nothing she could do. Reality didn't offer a magic cure, and she couldn't just get better overnight.

"Mom, I have a job now. I can support myself and Harper. You don't need to worry so much," Christina reassured her. "I've gotten used to being independent over the years. I never planned to rely on anyone."

Whether it was her parents or a man, she never considered depending on anyone but herself.

"You've always been stubborn. That's how you feel, but what about Harper? Kids from single-parent families have it tough. If William treated you poorly, I wouldn't push you. But he truly loves you; I can see that," Elisa said, speaking from experience.

William's actions and looks showed he wanted a family and would be a good husband and father.

So why did Christina keep refusing?

"Mom, I have my reasons. Let's go downstairs for dinner, and after that, we can explore the local market. How does that sound?" Christina hugged her arm. "We're here to relax, so let's enjoy ourselves."

Elisa knew this was a silent refusal.

Oh well, she still had a few days left. There was no rush; she could persuade her slowly.

She got up and went downstairs with Christina. Normally, someone in the late stages of cancer should watch their diet.

But since Christina knew Elisa had given up on chemotherapy, she thought, why restrict her diet? If she couldn't enjoy food, what was the point of living?

In her final days, Christina just wanted to minimize her mom's regrets.

"Mom, I remember you love crepes. Wait here while I get in line to buy some. I'll get a bit of everything you like," Christina said before heading across the street to the food stalls.

She bought everything Elisa liked.

Since Elisa had been hospitalized, she hadn't had any street food. She wanted to try everything, but after a few bites, she put down her fork. "Christina, you eat. I don't have an appetite."

Christina's eyes welled up.

She knew Elisa's body was very weak now, with failing organs and a poor digestive system, leading to a lack of appetite.

Soon, even going for a walk might be too difficult for her.

"Mom, I made a travel plan. Tomorrow, we'll watch the sunrise, visit the beach, and take a cable car ride. How does that sound?" Christina wanted to make the most of the time while her mom could still move around.

Elisa felt the same.

She didn't know how much longer she had-maybe a week, maybe two. She wanted to see as much as she could while she still could.

After exploring all the sights in that city, Christina took her to another city by plane.

Back with William...

One day, when picking up Harper, she told him, "Dad, the teacher said there's a parent-child sports day this weekend. Since Mommy isn't here, can you come with me?"

"If you're too busy, can you get me an excuse? I don't want to go alone."

William frowned. Didn't they just have one of these?

Harper thought he was going to say no and lowered her head in disappointment.

Other kids had their moms, dads, or both with them. If she went alone, she'd feel out of place.

"Harper," William said, handing her a doll from the back seat. "This is a gift for you. Of course, I'll go to the sports day with you."

He was Harper's biological father. How could he miss such an event?

Plus, he wanted to see what this preschool was up to with all these activities.

Whatever other kids had, his daughter would have too.

"Wow! Dad, you said yes!" Harper cheered. "The other kids will be so jealous. You're way cooler than their dads."

Kids these days were so mature. Even in preschool, they compared whose mom was prettier and whose dad was cooler.

William just smiled.

He made sure to finish his weekend work early and rescheduled his meetings, freeing up the whole day.

Early in the morning, he put on his sports gear and went to the school with Harper. The sports day was held on the playground, with each class standing together with their parents.

Seeing the principal's enthusiasm, William realized it was all about currying favor with the parents. This preschool wasn't the right place for Harper.

But that was a discussion for when Christina returned.

Harper held William's hand. "Dad, are you fast at running?"

###chapter 256 First Place

"Are you worried Dad Cavendish is gonna embarrass you?" William chuckled. "Don't sweat it, I'll snag that trophy for you."

Harper was once again in awe.

Soon, the kindergarten teacher announced the competition rules. The parent-child event was divided into several activities, starting with a relay race.

Harper wasn't the fastest runner, a bit slower than the other kids, but William quickly made up the difference.

Harper wanted to win, so he had to win.

William gave it his all throughout the race, and Harper stood at the finish line clapping non-stop. "Dad Cavendish, you're amazing!"

Hearing his daughter's praise, William felt a warm glow in his heart.

Next up was the three-legged race, which tested not only speed but also the coordination between parent and child.

With adults having longer legs and kids having shorter ones, if they didn't control their pace well, they would fall.

The race had just started, and several pairs had already fallen.

"Harper, let's go a bit slower and focus on stability," William said, slowing his pace.

Once he got the rhythm down, he gradually sped up, and unsurprisingly, they came in first place again.

Isaac clapped excitedly from the sidelines. "Harper, you and Mr. Cavendish are awesome!"

"It's mainly because Dad Cavendish is awesome," Harper sweetly told William. "You're the best dad in the whole kindergarten."

Getting his daughter's approval meant more to William than anything else.

He couldn't help but lean down and plant a kiss on Harper's forehead.

The sports day continued with several more events, and William either came in first or second, making quite an impression in the class.

Before this, it was always Christina who picked up and dropped off Harper, and she participated in school activities. Because of this, some kids thought Harper's parents didn't get along well, or that her dad didn't care about her.

But today, everyone saw firsthand how much William cared for Harper, and those rumors naturally disappeared.

Instead, there were envious voices.

"Harper, your dad is so handsome. How can I get a dad like that?"

"You're so silly! Just ask your mom to find you a new dad!"

"But will my mom agree?"

"How will you know if you don't ask? Go ask her, your mom is right over there."

Harper was exasperated.

She watched as a little boy ran to his parents, tugged on his mom's leg, and asked about getting a new dad.

Unsurprisingly, he almost got a mixed double beating from his parents.

Kids' comparisons are simple, but adults are different. One of the moms recognized William and started scheming.

This was William, after all.

If she could latch onto him, even as a secret lover, it would bring her immense benefits.

Just a little bit of his wealth would be enough for an ordinary person to live comfortably for a lifetime.

"Pax, from now on, Harper is your best friend. When you two play, you need to let her win, understand?" The woman held her son's hand, walking towards William while giving detailed instructions.

Pax shook his head. "But Mom, Harper isn't my best friend. Gia is!"

"Gia's parents are just regular workers. What good does it do to play with her? I'm your mom, would I steer you wrong?" The woman scolded him harshly.

Pax didn't dare say anything more.

Soon, they reached William. The woman kept trying to get close, saying she liked Harper, but her eyes were always on William.

William didn't want to engage with her, only responding out of politeness.

Just then, the teacher started handing out awards. William took Harper to the stage to receive the trophy and flowers.

These items weren't worth much, but they meant the world to him.

Harper happily held the flowers to her chest, standing tall and proud.

"Sweetie, you did great today. After the sports day, I'll take you to get your favorite KFC," William whispered to his daughter.

What kid could resist the lure of KFC?

Harper's smile grew even brighter, and this moment was captured on camera, becoming a cherished memory in her growth.

After the sports day, Harper said goodbye to Isaac and left the school with William.

They had lunch and then went to the mall, browsing the toy store.

As for Pax's mom, Orla, William had already forgotten about her.

But the next day, after dropping Harper off at school, as he was about to leave, Orla came running up. "Harper's dad, what a coincidence, we meet again."

She was wearing a low-cut dress, revealing her cleavage, and the skirt was short, barely covering her thighs.

Any man would have desires, and she was offering herself up. How could William resist?

Even a one-night stand would be a win for her.

With this in mind, her voice became even more coquettish.

"It's not a coincidence. It's school drop-off time, all parents are here," William said, not falling for it.

He turned his head away, not wanting to look at her. "Pax's mom, for your son's sake, you should dress more appropriately. This is a kindergarten, not a club."

Orla's face changed.

She hadn't expected William to react this way, but she wasn't willing to give up.

This was a chance to change her fate, and she was determined to seize it, no matter how hard it was.

"Mr. Cavendish, I wore a jacket when I came out today. I left it in the car because I was in a hurry. Our kids are classmates and get along so well. I wanted to talk to you about their education."

"I have nothing to discuss with you, and your husband is right behind you," William said, looking past her.

At the parent-child sports day, when she approached with Pax, William had his assistant investigate to see if the kids really got along.

Now that Orla was bothering him again, he had to do something.

Orla instinctively turned around, meeting her husband's angry gaze. At that moment, she had only one thought: she was doomed.

She had always resented her husband for not making enough money, but as a housewife with no job, her life would only get worse if she left him.

She had planned to become William's lover first and then divorce her husband, but now her husband had found out.

"Mr. Cavendish, I..." She tried to say something, but William didn't give her the chance, driving away immediately.

###chapter 257 Elisa Died

Orla was left alone to face her husband's fury.

Instinctively, she tried to explain, "Why are you here? I just dropped off the kids and was about to buy some groceries."

"You dressed like this to drop off the kids?" He pointed at her, his eyes blazing with anger. "Are you kidding me? Who was that guy? He didn't even look at you, and you were practically throwing yourself at him. Enough, I don't want to waste any more words on you. Let's just get a divorce."

He couldn't stand having a wife like this.

If William had shown her any kindness, Orla would have eagerly asked for a divorce.

But William didn't.

If her husband didn't want her anymore, what would she have left?

"Honey, you misunderstood. I was just trying to get close to him to help with your job."

"I don't need to sell out my wife to get a job. If you want to climb the social ladder, don't pretend it's for my sake." He shook off her hand again.

He wasn't negotiating; he was informing her. "We're going to schedule the divorce now. In a month, we'll finalize it. Orla, I don't want you anymore. The house is mine, and the kids are mine. I can't trust someone like you with our children."

Orla cried harder, but it was no use.

Meanwhile, Christina was missing her daughter. She hadn't seen Harper in days and needed their nightly video calls to sleep peacefully.

Elisa would also say hello to Harper.

"Grandma, have you not been eating well? You seem much weaker than before," Harper, even as a child, noticed something was wrong with Elisa.

Elisa was much thinner than twenty days ago, as fragile as paper, as if a gust of wind could blow her away.

Elisa smiled and shook her head. "Grandma is getting old. You need to be good and listen to your mom. Grandma will be watching over you from a very far place."

"Where is that far place? Is it another country?" Harper asked, confused.

Elisa nodded.

It was better to tell a little white lie than to explain death to such a young child.

Christina watched from the side, feeling an indescribable sadness.

She had been away for so many days, watching her mother's condition worsen. Now, Elisa was at death's door.

Christina wanted to do something, but there was nothing she could do. The helplessness was torturous.

"Christina, let's go back home tomorrow. They say you should return to your roots. I don't want to stay here anymore," Elisa said after hanging up the call. "I don't want to stay in the hospital. I want to spend my last days at home."

"Okay, whatever you want," Christina agreed.

She bought plane tickets for the next day and took Elisa to the airport early in the morning.

The flight was five hours long, and Elisa slept for four of them.

She was so weak now that even talking was exhausting.

William had gotten the news and was waiting with Harper in the terminal. When he saw them, he immediately went to support Elisa.

"William, how have you and Harper been getting along?" Elisa gently patted his hand.

William nodded. "We've been getting along great. Harper is very well-behaved."

"That puts my mind at ease. You're a responsible man. Please take care of them," Elisa said earnestly.

Christina didn't say anything. In these final days, she would go along with whatever Elisa wanted.

William also went along with her wishes, making many promises.

Elisa nodded, knowing William was a man of his word. With his promises, she felt at peace.

Considering her condition and personal wishes, William arranged for a home doctor so Elisa could rest at home.

Christina took a long leave from work to stay home with Harper and be with Elisa in her final days.

In the following days, Elisa's periods of lucidity grew shorter.

She ate less and less. At first, she could manage some liquid food, but eventually, she couldn't even drink water.

The home doctor administered nutritional injections daily, but their effect was limited, and too many caused her skin to swell.

"Christina, I don't want any more treatment," Elisa said during a moment of clarity. "The thing I worry about most is you. Promise me you'll be good to William. It's best for you and Harper."

"I know," Christina said, her eyes moist.

She could feel Elisa's concern, even if she couldn't accept the way it was expressed. She appreciated the sentiment.

After leaving the bedroom, Christina stood outside, her mind in turmoil.

Elisa was in such pain, even with painkillers.

She didn't want any more treatment, not wanting to prolong the suffering.

But as a daughter, Christina found it hard to stop the nutritional injections, knowing it would hasten her mother's death.

"Christina, what are you thinking?" William approached. "You should eat something. You haven't eaten much these days."

"I'm not hungry," Christina shook her head.

She needed time to think about whether to continue the injections.

Before she could decide, that night, just as she lay down to rest, the home doctor knocked on her door. "Ms. Windsor, your mother..."

"What happened to my mom?" Christina quickly opened the door.

She ran barefoot to Elisa's room.

Elisa had only a breath left. She gripped Christina's hand, using all her strength to give her final advice, "Be good to William... You all need to be good..."

With those words, Elisa closed her eyes forever.

Harper didn't understand death. She thought Elisa was just sleeping and tried to wake her.

"William," Christina called his name. "Take Harper away."

She didn't have the energy to care for Harper right now.

William picked Harper up. "Sweetie, let's go to the next room to sleep."

"I don't want to sleep. I want to see Grandma. What's wrong with her?" Harper struggled in his arms.

She looked at William, then at Christina, and asked, "Is Grandma dead?"

"Harper?" William was taken aback.

Neither he nor Christina had mentioned death to Harper. Had someone else told her?

"A classmate said his grandma died. Grandma told me she was going abroad, but that's not true," Harper said, her voice breaking. "My grandma is dead. I don't have a grandma anymore."

###chapter 258 Adjusting Mindset

Although Harper didn't grow up with her grandmother, ever since she and her mom moved back to the country, her grandmother had been incredibly kind to her.

She and her grandmother had developed a close bond.

William set Harper down and walked over to Christina. "Harper gets it. We don't need to shield her from this. Let's have her attend the funeral and say goodbye to her grandmother."

Christina nodded.

This was her first time saying goodbye to a close family member. The process was painful; she watched her mother go from a vibrant person to a small box of ashes.

Next, they had to arrange the funeral. Christina didn't want a big event; she only invited a few close friends and held a small memorial service.

At the funeral, Raymond approached her. "Christina, what are your plans now?"

He had been married to Elisa and knew how much Elisa wanted Christina to marry William. He agreed with that sentiment.

Now that Elisa was gone, as her stepfather, he felt it was his duty to be concerned about Christina's future.

Christina knew what he was getting at. "I'll take it one step at a time. Mom just passed away, and I can't think about the future right now. I need some time."

"Of course, don't put too much pressure on yourself. Don't be too sad. She suffered a lot from cancer these past few years. Her passing is a relief in a way," Raymond comforted her.

Christina understood this reasoning.

But understanding it and experiencing it were two different things.

She chatted with Raymond for a bit, then pulled herself together to greet the guests. William and Harper stayed by her side the whole time.

He didn't say much, just silently supported her.

After the guests left, William asked, "Shall we go home now?"

William knew she was hurting, so he stayed close to her.

In his past life, he hadn't been a good person and missed out on being with her and their child, which led to their child's death.

Even though this Harper wasn't the same as the one from his past life, to them, who had been given a second chance, she was a blessing from above. He was determined to treat this child and Christina well.

Now that he had the chance and the time to make up for his past mistakes, he was going to do it right.

"No, I need to sort through Mom's belongings," Christina shook her head. "You should take Harper home. She didn't sleep well last night and needs to rest."

Christina knew what William was thinking, but no matter how sad she was, she had to be strong. She was her mother's only daughter.

"But Mom, I want to stay with you," Harper looked at her, full of concern.

They say mothers and daughters are connected at the heart, and Harper could feel Christina's sadness.

She didn't know what she could do, but she wanted to help her mom feel better.

"Once I'm done, I'll come home. Tonight, I'll hold you while you sleep. You need to rest and grow strong," Christina kissed her daughter's forehead. "You need to eat and sleep well to grow up big and strong."

"Okay, I'll listen to you, Mom," Harper nodded obediently.

William first took Christina to her mother's place, then took Harper home.

He couldn't leave Christina alone, so he planned to put Harper to bed and then go back to get her.

"Dad, I don't want a bedtime story," Harper said as she lay in bed, not feeling sleepy at all. "I just want Mom to come home."

"How about you watch some TV? When you get sleepy, turn it off and go to bed. I'll go get Mom, okay?" William suggested gently.

Harper agreed.

She was still a child, and once William left and the room quieted down, she started to yawn.

Soon, she was fast asleep, hugging her blanket.

Meanwhile, William returned to Christina. "Need any help with the packing?"

"No, I can handle it," Christina said, not having the energy to deal with him.

She folded clothes one by one and then moved on to other belongings.

In the bedside drawer, she found a diary and a bottle of pills.

With limited time, Christina only glanced at them before packing them away.

As she was about to leave with the packed items, her half-brother Parker Cavendish walked in.

He looked at her with hostility. "What are you doing here?"

Elisa was dead, and with her marriage to Raymond over, Christina, not being Raymond's biological daughter, had no reason to stay.

Parker's face darkened at the thought. He had never accepted his father's marriage to Elisa, and now that he was older, he wouldn't let Christina stay.

"I'm here to pack my mother's belongings," Christina said, not doing anything wrong.

But Parker wasn't satisfied.

What was there to pack? He thought it would be better to throw everything out or burn it. He suspected Christina was just using this as an excuse to come over.

The next moment, William walked out of the room.

Seeing him, Parker swallowed his words. No matter how bold he was, he wouldn't dare upset William.

He watched silently as William and Christina left.

On the way back, Christina asked William, "You came to find me. What about Harper?"

"Harper is already asleep."

"After you drop me off, you can go back to work. Thanks for today," Christina said, closing her eyes to rest, not wanting to talk further.

William respected her choice.

He did have work to handle at the company and couldn't stay with her all the time. After dropping Christina off, he headed to the office.

Christina checked on Harper, who was sleeping soundly. Not feeling sleepy herself, she decided to read Elisa's diary.

It detailed Elisa's battle with cancer and her worries about Christina.

Christina felt a tightness in her chest, an indescribable pain.

At the end, she noticed a line: "Today, the doctor recommended a new medication that might work wonders for my condition. I want to try it."

This must be the bottle of pills.

There was no label on it, just a plain bottle. Was it safe?

Most medications come with labels and instructions. This one didn't. Her mother had seemed to have more time left, but her death had been sudden. Christina felt it was too quick.

And the way everyone reacted to her mother's death...

###chapter 259 Needs Companionship

Christina knew this wasn't going to be easy. She took the unmarked bottle of medicine and the cup her mother had used to get them tested.

At the hospital.

Christina adjusted her glasses and cautiously walked into the hematology department, wearing a mask.

She casually asked, "Can you do DNA tests here?"

"Of course!" The nurse smiled and nodded.

Christina carefully observed her surroundings, making sure no one suspicious was around.

She recalled the way her mother had died. The pain was so intense she could hardly breathe.

She shook her head to clear her thoughts. "Could you please test these items for DNA or anything else?"

"Sure, come back in two weeks for the results."

"Okay."

Christina left the hospital, feeling like a ghost of herself.

She couldn't bear the thought that her mother might have been murdered. What would she do then?

She was at a loss.

Her phone rang in her pocket.

She answered, and a sweet voice came through, "Mommy, when are you coming home? Harper misses you!"

Christina's heart ached, and she replied hoarsely, "Mommy will be home soon. Harper will be good, right?"

"Yes! I'll wait for you, Mommy!"

Harper's cheerful voice brought a wave of maternal love over Christina.

She realized how much she had been neglecting Harper lately.

Once this was over, she would make up for the lost time with her daughter.

Just as she hung up, her phone lit up again.

"Ms. Windsor! We have a big client at the office who specifically requested you for a design!"

Christina snapped back to reality, her energy returning.

She hesitated for a moment, then quickly said, "Okay, I'll be right there!"

Work was the only thing that could numb her pain from losing her mother.

Meanwhile, in another part of town.

Grace, dressed in a sophisticated outfit with her hair in soft waves, sat on a couch, swirling a glass of champagne.

"Brother," she turned to Parker beside her, "do you think what we're doing is right?"

A tear-shaped mole at the corner of her eye added to her allure.

Parker, standing by the window, looked down at the street below, a silent smile playing on his lips.

"What's not right about it?"

"They brought this on themselves."

His thin lips uttered the most cutting words.

They clinked their glasses, sealing their partnership.

"Let's make sure Christina feels the sting of failure," Parker said coldly, downing his champagne in one gulp.

Back at the office, Christina was meeting with the new client.

The client was an elegant elderly lady.

Her silver hair was impeccably styled, and her clothes were very refined.

Christina greeted her with a smile, "I heard you want to design an old mansion?"

"I have a few projects in progress that you might want to see."

She handed over her design portfolio.

The elderly lady waved it away dismissively. "I want something unique, designed by you alone!"

The other designers looked at Christina with pleading eyes. It was clear this client was difficult.

"Alright, what style are you looking for?"

"Black. Not just any black, but a vibrant, colorful black!"

Christina's face went pale. Colorful black?

The elderly lady turned back to emphasize, "And money is no object!"

The mansion was worth at least a hundred million dollars now.

Christina got to work immediately.

She spent the entire day visiting various design exhibitions for inspiration.

The next few days were a whirlwind of activity.

Until a phone call came in at 5 PM.

Christina answered, "Hello, who is this?"

"Mommy!" Harper's sweet voice came through. "When are you coming home?"

Christina, frazzled from work, instantly felt guilty.

She scratched her head and said softly, "Mommy will be home early today! I'll be there soon!"

Harper pouted, "Mommy, you're a liar! You always say you'll be home early, but I never see you!"

Christina sighed, trying to soothe her, "Harper, be good! Mommy will definitely be home early today!"

"Let Dad Cavendish play Legos with you for a bit, okay?"

Harper's voice brightened, "Can I have a candy?"

Christina hesitated.

Harper pleaded, "Please, Mommy, just one?"

Finally, Christina relented.

"Okay, but only one piece!"

Harper giggled, "Okay, I'll wait for you at home!"

Christina worked for another three or four hours.

When she looked up, it was already 8 PM.

She was the only one left in the office, the rain outside adding to her sense of loneliness.

She shivered and pulled her coat tighter.

She felt lost as she stared out the window.

By the time she got home, it was 8:30 PM.

She walked in eagerly, but Harper was nowhere to be seen.

"Where's Harper?" she asked William, puzzled.

William's cold gaze fell on her. "Harper had a great time and fell asleep."

Christina's face fell.

She had come home early just to spend time with Harper.

"Let's talk."

Before Christina could respond, William's cold voice cut through the air.

She hesitated, then nodded.

They sat at the bar in the living room, and William poured them both a glass of whiskey.

Christina asked softly, "What do you want to talk about?"

"Harper," William said coolly. "You're her mother. She needs you."

Christina felt a wave of shame.

She took a sip of whiskey, "I know, but..."

She let her hand fall, not knowing what to say.

William sensed something was off with Christina, like she was carrying a heavy burden.

He patted her hand reassuringly.

"I can't always be there for Harper either, but she really needs you."

Every child needs their mother's presence.

"I understand," Christina said weakly.

###chapter 260 As Expected

The next morning...

Christina had woken up early and prepared a table full of Harper's favorite dishes. She had decided that today, she would spend the entire day with her daughter.

As soon as Harper woke up, her little feet pitter-pattered on the floor. She opened the door and saw Christina cooking in the kitchen. Harper rubbed her eyes, staring in disbelief at the scene before her. Suddenly, she rushed behind Christina and hugged her tightly.

"Mom!" Harper's voice was sweet. "Am I dreaming? I woke up and saw you!"

Christina froze, her heart swelling with emotion. She immediately pulled Harper into her arms.

"Sweetie, Mommy's going to spend the whole day with you today, okay?"

"Really?" Harper's face lit up with joy.

In the next moment, Harper asked, "Can we go to the amusement park today?"

The air seemed to hang still. Christina instinctively bit her lip. Before she could refuse, Harper started to plead.

"It's just that I envy other kids who get to go to the amusement park. I've never been."

Harper's voice was filled with regret. After a moment of hesitation, Christina smiled gently and said, "If you want to go, then we'll go today!"

"Yay! We can go to the amusement park!" Harper immediately forgot all her worries and happily enjoyed breakfast with her mom.

"Mom, I want to ride the roller coaster at noon!"

"Mom, I want to ride the carousel!"

"Mom, I want a giant BBQ chicken leg!"

Christina agreed without hesitation, "Sure, today we'll do whatever you want!"

The mother and daughter happily finished their breakfast. They put on their special cartoon headbands and got ready to leave. As soon as they entered the park, they took a photo at the entrance.

"Mom, take another picture of me!" Seeing Harper's smiling face, Christina's eyes softened. A wave of guilt washed over her. Love often comes with a sense of inadequacy.

They had a blast exploring the castles and attractions. At 6 PM, it was time for the fireworks.

"Boom!" The fireworks lit up the night sky, illuminating everything.

"Wow! Fireworks!" Harper looked up at the sky, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

Just as they finished watching the fireworks, Christina received a phone call.

"Hello, Ms. Windsor, you need to come to the office immediately, there's an emergency!"

"Okay, I'll be there right away." Christina's mood became complicated as she hung up the phone. Looking at Harper, she felt even more guilty.

"Harper, Mommy has something to take care of. Can we leave now?" Christina asked cautiously.

Harper's smile froze. Even so, she pretended not to mind and waved her hand. "Let's go home, Mom!"

Christina glanced at Harper carefully. "Mommy will definitely take you out for more fun next time!"

"It's okay!" Harper smiled as understandingly as she could. "I've had a great day already!"

Her words filled Christina's heart. After settling Harper in, Christina rushed to the office. As soon as she arrived, she saw an elderly lady arguing with her employee, Kaia.

Kaia was tearfully saying, "We can't refund it! You didn't make it clear!"

Seeing this scene, Christina quickly stepped forward to ask what was going on. "What's the problem? Can I help you?"

The elderly lady snorted coldly when she saw Christina. "Your company is a scam!"

"My old house only has the second floor. Why did you design the first and third floors? Are you trying to make me pay more?"

Christina reflexively questioned, "Didn't you say..." But she stopped mid-sentence. It seemed the elderly lady never said her entire house was hers! A strange irritation rose in Christina's heart.

The elderly lady continued to demand, "You need to refund me now!"

A refund would mean all the work Christina and her design team did over the past few days would be for nothing!

Kaia stepped forward to argue, "But you didn't tell us!"

"Did you ask?" The elderly lady was furious, pointing at Kaia and cursing. "You shameless girls! Trying to cheat an old lady out of her money! If you don't refund me, I'll protest outside your company every day!"

Christina's heart raced; this couldn't escalate! Anything that damaged the company's reputation was unacceptable!

"Enough!" Christina shouted angrily.

The room fell silent instantly. The elderly lady's imposing manner visibly diminished. She muttered sarcastically, "I don't have money to give you!"

"You don't need to pay! Please leave now!" Christina struggled to control her emotions, trying to maintain her composure.

The elderly lady gave Christina a strange look before leaving, cursing under her breath.

Once she was gone, Christina took a moment to calm herself. Kaia, with red eyes, approached, "I'm sorry, I caused trouble again!"

"It's okay." Christina waved it off, pretending not to care. "Just put her on the blacklist."

Only she knew how agitated she felt inside. After a while, she stood up to make some coffee. Suddenly, her phone rang unexpectedly. It was the hospital!

"Hello, is this Ms. Windsor?"

"Yes, it's me. What's the matter?" Christina nervously gripped her cup.

The nurse on the other end calmly said, "Please come to the hospital. The DNA test results are in."

"Okay, I'll be there right away!" Christina quickly put down her coffee, grabbed her bag, and headed to the hospital.

In the specialist's office, Christina hesitated, staring at the doctor. "Doctor, is there a problem?"

The doctor looked hesitant. Christina quickly reassured him, "It's okay, just tell me the truth. I can handle it!"

What could be worse than losing a loved one?

"Can I ask what this is for?"

"It's for a cancer patient," Christina said firmly.

The next second, the doctor sighed, his eyes complicated as he explained, "This contains Moonleaf, and the concentration is very high! Moonleaf conflicts with cancer treatment drugs. Over time, it will weaken the patient and accelerate death!"

The doctor's words hit Christina like a sledgehammer. Accelerate death. Just as she suspected! Her mother's death was no accident!

In an instant, a cold, piercing feeling enveloped Christina.

###chapter 261 Clever by Half

"What happens if a cancer patient eats it?" Christina's voice trembled, her lips quivering as she refused to back down.

It was obvious she was still in shock.

"Over time..." The doctor's eyes were dark and unreadable. "A patient in the mid-stages of cancer would progress to the late stages within a month, and those in the late stages would have their death hastened."

It was a silent killer.

Such a method was terrifyingly effective.

In an instant, Christina felt a chill run through her entire body, as if she had fallen into an ice cave.

In a daze, Christina couldn't even remember how she walked out of the hospital.

She just felt cold all over, her legs weak.

Who could it be?

Who wanted to harm her mother?

At this moment, Christina felt like a soulless shell, wandering aimlessly down the street.

Suddenly!

A car approached from a distance.

It almost hit Christina, and the driver rolled down the window, shouting.

"Are you blind? Can't you see the road?"

"If you want to die, don't do it on the street!"

Stunned for a moment, Christina snapped back to reality, her face breaking into a desperate cry.

She felt like she needed to cry out all her pain and frustration.

The hatred for her mother's killer was overwhelming.

About half an hour later, Christina's mood had slightly improved.

She calmed herself down, her face showing an unprecedented determination.

"Mom, don't worry, I will get justice for you!"

Christina's voice was eerily calm, but her heart was consumed by hatred.

All she could think about now was revenge.

She needed to find out who was responsible for her mother's death.

The phone rang.

Seeing the caller ID, Christina composed herself and answered, "Hello, what's up?"

On the other end, William noticed Christina's heavy breathing.

He hesitated, "Have you been crying?"

"No."

Christina wiped her face and adjusted her voice.

She tried to make her voice sound less nasal.

She didn't have the patience to continue the conversation and couldn't help but ask, "What do you need?"

William lightly touched his watch, his eyes downcast.

The glass reflected William's slightly sorrowful expression.

"Nothing much, I just noticed you haven't been in a good mood lately and thought about taking you and Harper out for some fun."

Mentioning Harper made Christina's heart ache.

She quickly composed herself and forced a smile, "I've been busy lately. Please take care of Harper for me!"

"I'll let you know once I've handled everything!"

As soon as she finished speaking, she hung up the phone without a moment's hesitation.

Christina knew what William wanted to ask, but she didn't give him an answer.

She knew William liked her, but she selfishly used his affection to achieve her goals.

Thinking about it, Christina's lips curled into a self-mocking smile.

"Christina, you think you're so smart!"

"In the end, you don't even know who killed your mother!"

With a cold laugh, Christina began her investigation.

She needed to start by looking into the medication.

Moonleaf was a common herb, available through many channels.

But how did the person know the ingredients of her mother's daily medicine?

It had to be someone close to her!

Christina decided to start by checking the online shopping accounts of those around her.

Her primary suspect was Raymond!

When a wife dies, the husband is always a suspect!

So Christina hired a private investigator to look into Raymond and his family.

At a café.

The investigator sat across from Christina, wearing sunglasses, and asked, "The accounts you asked me to check, this one has a purchase record!"

"You can see the purchase history and the dates match up!"

Christina looked down and saw it was Parker's account!

Christina's eyes were complicated as she looked at the computer, "Just this one?"

Her tone was filled with doubt.

"Just this one!" The investigator frowned impatiently, "Don't you trust me?"

"Yes, but this matter requires extreme caution!"

Parker?

But Christina couldn't understand why he would harm her mother.

There didn't seem to be any deep-seated hatred between them!

"Is there any other useful information?" Christina asked, trying to keep her emotions in check.

The investigator's smile deepened.

He gestured with his fingers.

"Of course there is!"

"But the price..."

Before he could finish, Christina interrupted, "Money is not an issue!"

"As long as you can find the key to this problem, I'll pay you whatever it takes!"

Christina's words were firm, like a rose blooming in the cold wind.

The cunning private investigator immediately pulled out a stack of photos.

"These were taken earlier, showing Parker and his mom having coffee. He gave her these things."

"He hasn't bought Moonleaf in the past month!"

Sure enough!

Christina felt a chill down her spine!

Her gaze fell on the photo of Mira Collins.

Mira was her stepfather's ex-wife!

She was also Parker's biological mother!

In Christina's world, all the surrounding sounds disappeared, leaving only a dark light.

"So it was her," Christina muttered to herself.

After paying the private investigator a hefty fee, Christina walked out of the café, feeling lost.

She couldn't believe it was Mira!

Why would Mira want to harm her mother?

Was it for the inheritance, or something else?

The intense sense of betrayal made Christina's heart ache.

She instinctively pulled her coat tighter, seeking more security.

No!

She couldn't just sit and wait any longer!

Realizing this, Christina immediately gave the private investigator more money to look into Mira's recent activities.

Mira was planning a charity auction, scheduled for tomorrow night!

"Perfect opportunity!"

Christina's face lit up with a vengeful smile, her eyes reflecting the thrill of revenge.

She would tear off Mira's mask!

The next morning.

Christina wrapped her hand in a white cloth and dressed in black.

Before leaving, she glanced at her mother's portrait.

Her eyes welled up, tears slowly streaming down.

"Mom, I will get justice for you!"

She turned and left, her steps resolute.

Today, she would make Parker and his mother pay in blood!

With this thought, Christina took her mother's portrait and stepped out of the house. Suddenly, she felt a heavy blow to the back of her head.

###chapter 262 Waking Up

When Christina opened her eyes and took in her surroundings, she felt a wave of confusion.

She was in a warehouse, surrounded by darkness, unable to see anything clearly.

Just then, she heard voices outside.

Christina stayed still, not making any sudden moves, as she was tied up.

"Are you sure about this?"

"I don't have a choice. You know our situation."

"Bro, we gotta do this. If we don't, the consequences will be unimaginable, and we're out of options."

"Yeah, maybe before we could ignore it."

"But now, things are different."

Parker and Grace hadn't thought much about it initially. They didn't expect Christina to actually investigate that matter.

"Alright, let's leave it at that for now. We'll deal with the rest later."

Parker hung up the phone, opened the door, and walked in. Seeing Christina tied to a chair, he sneered.

Christina was surprised to see Parker.

"I didn't expect it to be you."

"I thought we didn't have such deep grudges. This seems unnecessary."

Parker was furious.

"Why do you think we don't have grudges? Even if we ignore the past, haven't you hurt me enough now?"

"And what are you trying to investigate?"

Christina caught the questions in Parker's words and smiled.

"What I'm investigating isn't hard to figure out, is it?"

"I told you before, I just want to find out the truth about my mom's death."

"But it seems you don't want me to. Regardless, you have no way out now, and things are different from before."

Parker sneered.

"Who says I have no way out?"

"As long as you don't make it back alive, none of this matters."

Christina was taken aback.

She didn't expect Parker to think this way.

"I just believe that people should face the consequences of their actions. If Mira did something wrong, she should be punished, not like this."

Parker dismissed her words and kicked her over.

"Who are you to talk about my mom like that?"

"And who says people must pay for their mistakes? I don't remember that being a rule, so stop talking nonsense."

Christina was shocked. She knew Parker's thinking was twisted, but not to this extent.

"I'm just trying to warn you not to go down the wrong path. If you insist, I can't predict what will happen next."

Parker ignored her.

"I think you forgot what I just said. No matter what, things are already like this, and the rest should be simple."

His expression was calm, and Christina sighed.

"Alright, let me go, and we can discuss this."

Christina saw the stubbornness in Parker's eyes.

She felt that if they didn't clear things up now, things would get complicated.

Parker sneered.

"You think I'm an idiot?"

"Let you go? Just like that?"

"I want to know how you found out about this."

Christina was about to retort, but Parker interrupted.

"Never mind, I don't care how you found out. I just want to shut you up."

Seeing Parker's crazed look, Christina instinctively tried to move back.

But tied to the chair, she couldn't move an inch.

"Don't bother running. There's no one else here but me."

"I thought there was no need to do anything to you, given our awkward relationship."

"But you did something you shouldn't have, and you need to pay the price, even if you don't realize it."

Christina smiled.

"If you say so, there's nothing I can do."

"I just want to tell you, some things come with a price. What your mom did and what you did can't be lumped together."

Christina knew that anything she said would anger him.

So she didn't bother holding back.

"Do you think your mom shouldn't be hurt, but my mom can?"

"My mom could have lived longer, but now she's gone because of you."

"Don't you have any responsibility?"

Although Christina didn't understand or agree with what her mother did, Elisa was still her mother.

No matter how much she resented her, she couldn't hold a grudge forever.

And Elisa could have lived longer if not for these people.

"I don't know what you're talking about. My mom is innocent, and you won't get anything out of me."

"Even if you know, so what?"

"Christina, I was willing to let you go. I thought we didn't need to be enemies."

"But now, if you don't want to live, don't blame me. Right?"

Parker finished, looking stubborn.

Christina had a bad feeling.

Although she was prepared, things seemed off.

"What are you going to do to me?" Christina instinctively tried to move back but couldn't.

"Nothing, just making sure you never come back. Your mom is dead anyway."

"If you care so much about her death, why not join her?"

Christina wanted to speak, but her mouth was gagged, and her eyes were blindfolded.

Tied to the chair, she couldn't move, no matter how hard she tried.

"Stop struggling."

"No matter how much you struggle, you won't get free. I've made sure of that."

"You want to leave here, but I'm afraid I can't let you."

"Where do you think this boat will go? And what will happen when it gets there?"

Parker's expression was slightly crazed.

Just hearing his tone made Christina frown deeply.

"Fine, since you're about to die, I'll give you a chance to speak."

###chapter 263 Thrown into the Sea

"Where exactly are you taking me?" Christina asked, her voice shaky as the gag was finally removed.

She still couldn't see anything, just a hazy blur around her. Moments ago, she was sure they were in a warehouse. Now, she could hear the ocean.

"You didn't really think I'd leave you tied up on land, did you?" Parker's voice was cold.

"There's a saying: 'If you're alive, I need to see you; if you're dead, I need to see your body.' If I left you there, someone would definitely find you. I'm not an idiot."

"Besides, do you really think I'd be dumb enough to believe those things?"

Christina felt a sinking dread at his words. "What are you planning to do?"

"I'm not planning anything. I just want you to disappear from this world. As long as you're gone, you won't be able to harm me or my sister. My mom won't be affected either, so you don't need to worry about anything else."

After saying this, Parker stuffed the gag back into Christina's mouth and signaled to the men behind him. "What are you waiting for? Throw her out! Do I need to repeat myself? I already told you, this situation is different from what you think. If you want to achieve your goal, or think this is like the previous times, it's not. But you need to have the capability to handle it."

The men, hearing this, untied Christina from the chair. The moment she was freed, she struggled fiercely, despite her discomfort. But her resistance only made them move faster.

"Alright, calm down. We're just doing our job," one of them said as they tied her hands in front of her again. Her hands and feet were bound, and her mouth was gagged, leaving her only able to breathe through her nose.

"Alright, drive forward. Once we reach that part of the ocean, we can throw her overboard. If I remember correctly, no one comes around here. Goodbye, Christina. If you hadn't pursued those matters, I might not have done this to you. But you're too persistent, so you can only blame yourself for taking things too seriously."

After saying this, Parker got up and left. Then Christina was thrown into the sea by the men. With her body bound and a heavy stone tied to her feet, she couldn't move. At first, Christina struggled to breathe. Soon, she lost consciousness. The stone kept her from floating up, no matter how hard she tried.

"It's done. She won't survive," one of the men said.

Parker called Mira after returning. "You did well. Christina must not find out about this, or the consequences will be severe. And this is different from before. That's all for now. I've done this last thing for you, but the future won't be as simple. Christina may be dead, but the situation is still serious. I'm worried William will investigate."

"Don't worry. Even if he wants to investigate, there's no evidence. Christina can't come back to life. Besides, that part of the ocean is shark-infested. There's nothing else to worry about," Mira reassured Parker.

Parker sighed. "I get it. I'm heading back."

Grace, upon hearing the news, was indifferent. "Good riddance. Now we don't have to worry. Mom's secret must stay hidden, or the consequences will be unimaginable."

They hadn't thought much about it initially. They even believed that, given the current situation, it was the same as before. Even if the outcome was the same, there wouldn't be any problems.

Meanwhile, William was at home with the child, feeling conflicted.

"Where's Mom?" the child asked, now aware that William was her father. But despite William's efforts to make up for lost time, she couldn't seem to get close to him.

"I'll try to contact Mom. Can you wait here for a bit?" William gently comforted the child, then turned to call Christina.

Learning about Christina's mother's death had shocked William, but since she died of illness and the funeral was rushed, he attended to pay his respects. Later, Christina said she wanted to be alone for a while. She had been gone for days, and he didn't say much, just told her to reach out if she needed him, promising to be there for her. But Christina had said that some things couldn't be undone, and he shouldn't pretend to care.

Although the past was long gone, Christina hadn't forgotten. William thought time would heal her wounds. But now he realized Christina was stubborn, unable to let go. He had no choice but to continue, knowing that no matter what he did, the outcome was fixed and unchangeable.

Meanwhile, Christina, feeling suffocated, suddenly opened her eyes. The black cloth over her head had floated away in the water. The ropes on her hands had loosened from being soaked, and Christina quickly untied them. Though it was difficult underwater, she had a slim chance of survival.

She thought of Harper. Christina felt she shouldn't die like this. She had a child and a bright future. She needed to bring these criminals to justice. Not knowing where she was, she focused on freeing herself and surviving. She believed she could find a way back. With this determination, she fought harder.

Elsewhere, the Duke and some others were on a yacht.

"Are you sure the view here is good? This spot is nice, but would you really spend so much to rent a yacht?" one of the guests asked.

The Duke dismissed the concern. "I don't think it's as complicated as you make it out to be. Besides, if it were as you say, things would be even more exaggerated. So, no need to worry."

The Duke felt confident in his decision.

###chapter 264 Saving People

"Alright, it's your money, so you call the shots."

"We can't really say much, but sometimes your reactions are totally unexpected."

The Duke just smiled faintly.

"Some things are hard to predict. Who knows, maybe we'll find some unexpected surprises here?"

He looked serious, and the others fell silent, sometimes thinking he made a lot of sense.

But other times, they thought the Duke was a bit eccentric.

Anyway, they were used to the Duke saying one thing and doing another.

Meanwhile, Christina finally managed to untie the rope.

But due to holding her breath for so long, she passed out from lack of oxygen just as she freed herself.

Without the rope's restraint, Christina began to float upward.

The Duke's yacht arrived in the same area.

His companions marveled at the scenery.

"I think coming here with you was a great decision. I never expected to find such inspiration for my sketches."

"Of course."

"If it were anywhere else, I wouldn't have brought you. I spent a long time studying the map for this spot, and it's pretty much undiscovered."

"And this part of the sea is unpolluted, so you can enjoy it without worry."

His companions nodded in agreement.

"Let me use the binoculars to see if there's anything interesting in the distance."

The Duke smiled, holding his wine glass and gazing ahead.

Just then, one of his friends spotted Christina floating in the water.

At first, he couldn't believe his eyes and thought he was seeing things.

"Is that a person?"

"Maybe I've been staring at the sea too long and my eyes are playing tricks on me."

His comment made the others curious.

When they all looked through the binoculars, their eyes widened in shock.

"It really is a person, and it looks like a woman."

Everyone was puzzled.

Hearing this, the Duke grabbed the binoculars from his friend.

When he saw the person in the water, he was stunned.

He quickly ordered a speedboat to be lowered and, along with a few lifeguards, went to rescue Christina.

"Judging by your reaction, you know this lady, don't you?"

Indeed, despite her disheveled appearance, Christina was strikingly beautiful.

They were all puzzled about how someone could end up alone in such a remote part of the sea.

"Let's not worry about that now. We need to wake her up first."

When Christina opened her eyes again, she found herself in a room. She thought she might be dreaming.

Before she passed out, all she felt was the cold sea water.

She had been wearing very little when she was taken, making her current situation even more surprising.

"You're awake?"

Hearing the voice, Christina looked up.

Seeing the familiar face, she thought she might be mistaken.

"Don't be curious, it's really me. Honestly, I think we have a special connection."

Christina gave an awkward smile.

"If you don't feel like smiling, don't force it. Here, have some hot water first."

"How did you end up in the sea?"

"Fate or not, if I hadn't come here, I wouldn't have found you."

Christina's eyes flashed with anger.

"Yeah, lucky me," she practically spat out the last word.

"I'm really curious about what happened to you. You don't look like you're in a good situation."

Christina decided not to hide anything and briefly explained what had happened.

"Before this, I never thought people could be so malicious. Now I see how true that is."

"At first, I thought they wouldn't dare go this far, but I was wrong."

"Where are we now?" Christina asked, curious about her location and wondering where Parker had taken her.

"This is the neighboring sea of Zephyra."

"This area is deserted. Our yacht had to pass through several checkpoints to get here. If you came from your city, it would take even longer. Who did you offend to end up here?"

Christina frowned slightly.

"Never mind, I won't bother you. Get some rest, and we'll talk when you wake up."

"Where are we going now?"

"We're heading back. Finding you floating in the sea ended our sketching trip. We planned to stay nearby, but now we'll return."

Christina sighed.

She nodded and asked the Duke to leave.

When the Duke came out, his friends looked at him curiously.

"Who was that beautiful woman?"

"Do you two have a special connection? I always thought you didn't date because you liked men."

"So, you do have someone you fancy. What a coincidence."

"Yeah, but she seems to be in some trouble. How did she end up in such a situation?"

Though it was strange, they were all familiar with family conflicts.

They knew Christina's appearance here wasn't simple and that the situation was likely very complicated.

The Duke shook his head.

"I only asked a bit, but she fell asleep. If you really want to know, ask her when she wakes up."

They quickly shook their heads.

"We don't have the guts. She doesn't look easy to deal with."

"If you don't want to talk, that's fine."

"Exactly."

When Christina woke up, it was already evening.

The yacht had traveled a long way.

"I didn't expect you to save me again. Last time at the exhibit was a coincidence, but this time?"

Christina stood by the railing, holding a cup of hot coffee.

"This time was also a coincidence. It shows we have a special connection. But I didn't expect your place to be so dangerous."

"Why don't you stay with me? At least I can keep you safe."

He spoke half-jokingly, half-seriously, knowing Christina would never agree.

He had suggested it before, and Christina had firmly refused. Now, he just smiled.

###chapter 265  Discussing the Plan

"Alright, you don't need to keep that stern face."

"I knew you wouldn't agree. I was just throwing it out there. If you had agreed, I would've been shocked."

Christina gave a faint smile at his words.

"It's good you see it that way. Honestly, I can't give you an answer right now."

"And I've got unresolved stuff back home. I just see you as a really good friend."

The Duke's friend happened to overhear Christina's words.

He had intended to catch some juicy gossip but was taken aback by the harsh reality he heard.

"Alright, you don't need to say more. I get it. If this is the way you want to go, then let's do it."

"As a friend, I'm honored to help you."

Christina fell silent again, knowing the Duke's words were true and feeling grateful for his care during this time.

Later, Christina returned to the cabin and told the Duke to let her off once they reached their destination.

"I didn't realize your situation was this bad. At first, I thought you two were just too shy to confess to each other."

"But I didn't expect it to be one-sided."

The Duke spread his hands.

"Some things are beyond our control. Christina is incredibly charming, so I don't know how to respond to what you're saying."

"You all know what's happening now, right?"

They nodded quickly.

"Yeah, we not only know but completely understand you. We won't bring it up again."

"We get your sadness and know things haven't been easy for you."

They didn't say much more, as the current situation overshadowed everything else.

Several hours later, they finally reached their destination.

Meanwhile, Parker suddenly opened his eyes.

He had just had a nightmare where Christina hadn't died and had come back for revenge.

When he told the person next to him, they scoffed.

"You must have really had a bad dream. How could Christina come back?"

"If I remember correctly, you tied her feet with rope and stones. Even if she had the strength to break free, how could she swim out of that vast ocean alone?"

Parker sighed in relief.

"You're right. Sometimes I get too obsessed. I don't think Christina could escape."

"But we still need to be cautious. Things aren't as we imagined."

"No matter how cautious we are, things are different now. We just need to take care of ourselves."

On the other side, Christina disembarked with the Duke.

Once they returned to their residence, Christina finally relaxed.

"At least I'm still your friend. Why are you so tense around me?" the Duke teased.

Christina shook her head.

"This has nothing to do with you. I'm just trying to sort out my thoughts."

"At first, I didn't think much of it. I didn't expect things to turn out this way."

"People's hearts are unpredictable. I didn't consider how eager those behind this would be."

Christina had been curious about who was behind these actions.

But now, it seemed more complicated than she thought.

"Take your time to think it through. Once you have a plan, come to me, and I'll help you."

The Duke left Christina to her thoughts.

But Christina grabbed his arm.

She looked up at him seriously.

"I know you're right, but I need you to stay and help me sort this out. Things are different now."

The Duke sighed.

He instructed the butler to bring them hot coffee.

"I think this is a tense moment. You should rest. No matter what their intentions are, if you can't take care of yourself, what will happen next?"

"I know, but I can't calm down. I know you're looking out for me."

Christina spoke earnestly, and the Duke sighed again.

"Alright, I can't argue with you."

They continued their discussion.

Soon, Christina had a clearer idea.

"If Parker knows about this, it means my suspicions were correct."

Before being kidnapped, Christina had only a few clues.

She didn't know the details and was looking for more information.

She hadn't expected Parker to be so ruthless.

He had her tied up directly.

That's how everything unfolded.

"I understand what you're saying, but I think these people have more in mind than what we see."

"They might have other plans, so you need to be extra careful."

Christina sighed.

"That's why we need to be more vigilant."

Meanwhile, besides Parker, Mira also had a nightmare.

After waking up, Mira called Parker to ask if everything was handled cleanly.

"Don't worry, I've taken care of it. Even if they find out, there won't be any progress in such a short time. Everything is fine."

He spoke seriously, and Mira sighed.

"I hope so because William is already looking for Christina."

Yes, William had tried to contact Christina but couldn't reach her.

It had been a long time, and Christina's phone went from unreachable to completely off.

Although William tried to calm Harper, Harper seemed to have a psychic connection with Christina and had been crying for the past two days.

William was anxious and used his connections to search for her. When he finally found out Christina was missing, he was furious.

"You better give me a reasonable explanation. Why isn't she with you?"

He went to the last place she was seen. Although he didn't need to go personally, Christina was more important to him than his own life.

He had to find her, and the response he got made him sneer.

"You think you can brush me off by saying she just had a meal here?"

"Do you not know my capabilities, or do you think the entire Cavendish Corporation can't bring down your restaurant?"

"Mr. Cavendish, what do you mean by that?"

###chapter 266 Preparing to Return

"Seriously?"

"I haven't found the person I'm looking for, and now this mess happens. Are you telling me to just ignore it?"

"Or maybe I wasn't clear enough before."

When the boss came out, William stayed completely calm, meeting his gaze without flinching.

"I just think you shouldn't handle things so harshly."

"And besides, she went missing here. How is that our fault? We can't keep an eye on everyone."

Their point was that if things had stayed as they were before, it wouldn't have been a big deal. But William was being overly aggressive.

He didn't respect them at all, so now they had to show their own stance.

"Although I don't know what you're thinking, I remind you to consider the consequences of your actions."

"If you don't care about the consequences, then be prepared to pay the price."

William and his entourage made a grand entrance and left just as grandly.

Watching him leave, the boss slammed the table in anger.

"This William is too much."

"His woman just came here for a meal and went missing. Now he wants us to pay the price?"

"We've already cooperated with the surveillance investigation."

"But boss, apart from Christina, nothing else seems to have happened. If this were just a regular incident, it would be fine."

"But I'm afraid it might drag our restaurant into it, which wouldn't be good," one of his subordinates whispered.

The boss frowned deeply at this.

"How would I know?"

"Whatever grudges they have, they should resolve them themselves. Why come to me? I can only handle some minor issues."

He remained serious, while the others looked cautious.

After leaving, William headed straight to the relevant departments.

But the investigation there yielded no results.

When Parker received the news, his expression turned grim.

"I knew William would investigate, but I didn't expect him to be so reckless."

"Yeah, he's not like the person we saw before."

"I have a feeling he's doing this on purpose."

"Stop talking. We've already prepared for this, and it's been so long. He definitely won't find anything."

They were all confident.

Meanwhile, Christina and the Duke analyzed the situation.

The Duke told Christina that if she wanted to expose Mira, she needed to gather all the evidence first.

In other words, she had to collect evidence before returning.

"In a foreign country, gathering evidence seems difficult, and my identity is awkward."

Going through official channels or other means wasn't suitable for Christina, and she didn't even have a phone.

"Right, I should contact William first."

The Duke was surprised to hear this. He knew Christina took these matters seriously, but he didn't expect her to be so thorough.

He sighed and lent his phone to Christina.

William had searched everywhere but couldn't find Christina. He was worried sick and furious, but he had no choice but to keep looking.

Just then, he got an overseas call. He thought it was the kidnappers.

He was ready to negotiate, but when he answered, he heard Christina's calm voice.

"Stop looking for me. I'm safe for now, but you need to keep up the pretense of searching."

Given their history, Christina's tone towards William was frosty.

She called to reassure Harper, not wanting him to worry.

Christina had woken up underwater thinking of Harper. As a mother and someone who had been reborn, she couldn't die again because of these circumstances.

"Are you okay? Where are you? Do you need me to send someone to get you?"

"What happened before? Tell me, and I'll handle it."

William's barrage of questions made Christina frown in annoyance.

"No need."

"I'm safe for now. Just tell Harper I'm fine and will return on time."

"Don't worry about anything else."

With that, Christina hung up before William could respond.

The Duke, puzzled, asked, "If you have no feelings for William, why tell him this?"

Christina sighed. The events of her past life were still fresh in her mind. Although William had changed in some ways, this time was different.

"I don't know how to explain it, and I don't think it's worth discussing."

"Alright, if you don't want to talk about it, I won't push. I trust you have your reasons."

"Let's proceed as you suggested."

The Duke sent his men to investigate. Given their clean records, they quickly uncovered the details.

"Did you expect Parker to do this?"

"I knew Parker had issues, but I didn't think he'd be so despicable."

The Duke sighed.

"Didn't you say it yourself? The human heart is the hardest to predict. This situation isn't uncommon."

"But I'm curious, how do you plan to retaliate? These pieces of evidence alone aren't enough."

"Let me come up with a plan."

"You mean finding evidence of their kidnapping and throwing me into the sea."

"I think it's not that simple. Parker can be stupid but also decisive and smart. Just investigating like this might not work."

The Duke waved his hand dismissively.

"Other methods might not work, but don't you trust my abilities?"

"I've always thought I was competent enough not to fail at this."

Christina sighed.

"It's not that I don't trust you. I just think your method might not work here."

"How do you know if you don't try? Leave it to me, and you'll see the results."

With that, the Duke instructed his men, and the room fell silent again.

"Since the plan is in motion, why not relax a bit? You've been tense since you got off the ship, frowning all the time."

Christina looked puzzled.

"Is it that obvious? I thought I was relaxed."

"Why don't you check the mirror yourself?" The Duke pointed to a mirror in the corner.

###chapter 267  Found Evidence

"Alright, I'll go check it out."

The Duke's cheerful tone was contagious.

Christina found herself swept up in it too.

So, the two of them chatted for a while.

After a few hours, the Duke's men brought over some entertainment.

Christina was taken aback by what she saw.

"I knew you were impressive, but I didn't expect you to be this fast."

The Duke shrugged off Christina's compliment.

"What's the big deal? I might be slow with other things, but when it comes to you, I'm always the quickest."

The Duke subtly expressed his genuine feelings for Christina again.

Christina understood, but chose to play dumb at that moment.

After all, if she acknowledged it now, things would get awkward between them.

"Alright, thank you."

Meanwhile, William couldn't stop staring at his phone.

He knew Christina was worried about Harper.

But he was more worried about Christina.

He had no idea who had hurt Christina, and she wouldn't tell him anything over the phone.

He thought there was a rift between them.

But after all this time, he thought they would have resolved some of it. Yet, Christina still didn't trust him at all.

"Daddy, where's Mommy? Where did she go?"

Harper had woken up and came out of her room, tugging at William's pant leg, looking up at him with big, sad eyes.

"Mommy's fine. She just called me and said she'll be back soon. Be a good girl, Harper."

William's tone softened, something that only happened when he was talking to his daughter.

"Are you sure? Don't lie to me. Mommy says liars are puppies."

"I'm not lying. Why would Daddy lie to you?"

Hearing Harper's words, William's heart softened a bit.

He hadn't thought much about it before.

He thought everything was fine as it was.

But lately, he felt like he was falling short compared to Christina.

Meanwhile, Parker noticed William was investigating.

They were getting nervous.

"We need to clean up all traces. Check if there's anything we missed."

"Christina can't come back to life, so even if William finds evidence, he can't do anything to us. But you need to understand what this situation could turn into."

Everyone was worried after hearing this.

"You're right, we shouldn't be in a rush, but we're afraid things might get out of hand."

"Yeah, are you sure everything's cleaned up? Something feels off. Maybe we should double-check. No one will find out anyway."

Mira was sure Christina was dead.

She was acting even more smug.

"Whatever, it's all in the past. I don't know why you're still worried."

"If there was a problem, it would have been discovered back then, not now. So, I don't think there's anything to worry about."

"Mom, it's not the time to be thinking like that. We need to let this blow over."

"Yeah, it's normal for William to investigate, but we can't let him find out too much. Otherwise, things might get out of control."

They exchanged worried glances, unsure about the situation.

Unlike Parker, Grace was unconcerned.

"Bro, don't you have any confidence in yourself? These are minor issues. Just eat and drink as usual."

"As long as Christina's dead, there won't be any more problems. So, relax. Even if William finds out, what can he do? The dead can't come back to life. When he finds out, we'll just make a deal with him."

Grace was naive.

She completely overlooked Christina's importance to William.

"Alright, I get it. I'll stop investigating for now."

The Duke, besides sending people to find evidence of Parker's actions, also found other clues.

"Honestly, this is a pleasant surprise. I didn't think they'd make a move, but they did."

Christina frowned deeply after reading the information.

"I knew Mira wasn't a good person, but I didn't expect her to be this vicious."

"Now I understand why you were so angry before."

The Duke's expression darkened.

"Don't worry. I'll send you back the same way you came. But are you sure you want to do this so openly?"

Christina shook her head.

"Of course not. These pieces of evidence aren't enough. I need to keep investigating the lead I was following before."

"If I uncover everything, Mira won't get away."

Christina had only suspected Mira was involved in her mother's death.

But she didn't expect Parker and the others to be so blatant.

Parker's direct actions were one thing, but what they did afterward was even more shocking.

Christina found it all quite laughable.

"Even though I'm prepared, I think this time it might be really tough for you."

Christina waved her hand dismissively.

"No matter how tough it is, I'm ready to face it all."

"But thank you. Once this is over, I'll treat you to dinner."

The Duke chuckled.

"With our relationship, why are you talking about dinner?"

"Do you think I care about that?"

"Besides, whether before or now, I don't think that's the point."

Christina fell silent again after hearing his words.

"Alright, enough of that. I know how you feel, but I really can't respond to it."

The Duke didn't press the issue. He knew his own persistence.

He also knew some things couldn't be forced, so he just sighed.

He arranged a boat for Christina.

"Thank you. Next time we meet, I hope it'll be different."

Before leaving, Christina gave the Duke a hug.

Besides communication equipment, the Duke also gave Christina a lot of money, something no one else could provide.

At first, Christina thought it was simple.

She just needed to get back. But then she realized she couldn't reveal her whereabouts.

Parker's people were everywhere.

If she exposed herself, she wouldn't be able to find the crucial evidence.

"I'll send two experts with you. They're great at surveillance. Don't worry, once the job's done, they'll leave. They won't be a burden."

The Duke was thorough, and Christina felt a bit guilty.

###chapter 268 Continue Investigating

"What's up?"

"Feeling guilty now? You know how much I care about this stuff."

"If you really feel bad, just work hard and get it done quick. Like you said, you can treat me to dinner next time."

Hearing this, Christina stopped worrying.

She turned and boarded the ship. The Duke watched her leave and sighed.

Just then, his friend walked over and patted him on the shoulder.

"Didn't think you'd care so much about her. Helping out such a beautiful woman, you're practically bending over backward."

The Duke smiled and looked into the distance.

There was a hint of confusion in his expression, but he knew what he wanted to do.

"Mind your own business. Everyone's got their own secrets."

"This is my issue. I don't meddle in yours, and this isn't what we originally planned."

His friend sighed.

"I can't control you. You're stubborn sometimes."

"But Christina's not easy to handle, except maybe when it comes to her dreams."

"You need to be ready for anything else, or it might get even tougher."

The Duke didn't say anything more. He already knew what was coming next.

Meanwhile, Christina, with the detective who was helping her, explained the situation.

The detective spoke fluently in Valorian with Christina.

"You speak Valorian?"

"Yeah, I studied there as a kid. After coming back, I got into this line of work. I'm loyal, don't worry, I'm not a spy."

Christina couldn't help but laugh at his words.

"That's good. But this time, it won't be easy. These people are really cunning, not like the Valorians you might imagine."

On their way, Christina chatted a lot with the detective.

"No matter what they do or think, I believe we can find out."

Half a day later, the ship reached its destination.

Christina had to take a different route this time.

Even though Parker and his team had confirmed Christina's death, they didn't let their guard down. Parker even sent people to investigate.

His intentions were hard to read, but now they had no choice but to investigate thoroughly.

"Once we arrive, I'll change clothes and give you the clues I've gathered. Then we'll stake out."

Christina needed to confirm that Mira poisoned her mother.

She had to find Mira's motive and the timing of the poisoning, which was complicated.

When Elisa was examined at the hospital, the doctors said it was cancer.

But Elisa's symptoms were strange, unless special drugs were used.

Initially, Christina didn't think much of it, attributing it to her mother's temper and reckless behavior.

But later, she realized it was different, not what she thought.

Now, her suspicion was even stronger.

"I didn't think it was possible at first, but now that you mention it, it does seem outrageous."

Christina and the detective organized the details and began their investigation.

Since Christina's whereabouts were unknown, Mira wasn't worried. She was even chatting at a beauty salon.

Christina decided to try her luck and unexpectedly overheard some details.

"Even if I did something to Elisa, so what?"

"No matter how skilled they are, they might not find out. So I think there's no need to worry about it."

"Is that what you think?"

"Yes, Elisa was a pain. I don't even want to talk about her."

They were gossiping wildly.

Christina frowned deeply, clenching her fists. She knew these people weren't normal. But she didn't expect them to be so foolish, openly mocking. They had no respect for the deceased, only caring about money.

After the attendant left, Christina used a stun gun. She knocked out the attendant, and the detective dragged her aside. Christina quickly took the attendant's coat, hat, and mask.

Inside, Mira was wearing a face mask and couldn't see who entered.

Christina lowered her voice.

"Is what you said true?"

"I feel like Christina isn't dead."

"How could she not be dead? With everything she's done, she should be dead a thousand times over. It's been so long."

"You're just too scared to understand these things."

"It's been so long, things should be as they are."

Christina frowned deeply.

"You talk a lot today, and your voice sounds different. What's up?"

"I wasn't feeling well earlier. But since you said Christina is dead, why worry? Her mom died of cancer."

Christina was fishing for information.

"Some things aren't as they seem. Even if I told you, what difference would it make?"

"You're not thinking of working with Christina, are you? If so, I'll make sure you can't work here."

"No, no, you misunderstood."

Christina quickly changed the subject until Mira applied another face mask. Christina pretended to push a cart out, then changed clothes and left with the detective.

"What are you two doing?"

At the front desk, they were noticed.

"Just looking around. Is this place a secret?"

The receptionist was intimidated by the detective's look and quickly shook her head.

"No, no, nothing like that. You're free to go."

With that, the receptionist fell silent.

They walked out briskly.

Outside, they reviewed the information they had gathered. Christina wasn't the only one asking questions; the detective also used his appearance to get information.

They managed to gather some useful details.

With this, they went to the place where Mira bought the drugs. Initially, the place was tight-lipped, but with money and threats, they got the information they needed.

###chapter 269 Publicly Announced

"Alright, now that I've got all the info, it's time to come back to life."

Christina's tone was serious, and the detective let out a sigh when he heard her.

"Even though I know this is different from before."

"There's really no problem, but I never thought it would end up like this."

After gathering all the information, Christina made sure to hire some online trolls.

Parker and his friends were on vacation.

Mira had just finished her facial mask and was about to invite some friends over for a card game.

But her friend's phone kept ringing, and when they saw the news online, they gave Mira some weird looks.

"Why are you all looking at me like that? What's going on?"

They sighed helplessly.

"We don't know how to say this. Just look for yourself."

Hearing this, Mira pulled out her phone and saw headlines about a bloody murderer and calls for justice.

At that moment, the supposedly dead Christina suddenly showed up at their doorstep.

She even brought some media along to hold a press conference, exposing the crimes of Mira and Parker.

"What nonsense are you spouting?"

Parker rushed to the scene as soon as he got the news.

"You're not real, right? How could Christina be here?"

Seeing Parker's twisted face, Christina couldn't help but sneer.

"Why can't I be here?"

"In other words, are you scared because you see me here? Why would you be scared of me? Is it because you killed me?"

Christina's smile was gentle, but the gentler it was, the more unsettling it felt.

"Why aren't you saying anything?"

"Didn't you have a lot to say just now?"

William was in a meeting at the company when he heard the news of Christina's return and rushed to the scene.

By the time he arrived, Christina had already called the police, and they were there.

"Officer, here is the evidence I found."

"I can help you investigate my mother's death. There must be something wrong."

"My mother was healthy, but after certain events, she suddenly got cancer."

"And if she hadn't taken that medication, she might have survived."

In other words, Elisa's cancer was caused by the medication.

If it weren't for that drug, Elisa wouldn't have gotten cancer, as she was very health-conscious.

"Rest assured, we will investigate. If the information is accurate, those responsible will be held accountable."

Christina's mother was already dead. The investigation was to seek justice for Elisa, nothing more.

"I believe in you."

Christina looked at them with determination.

Parker, however, was indifferent.

To him, Christina was just desperate, with nothing left to lose.

"If you can really find me, then fine."

"But I want to say that I've already taken care of everything."

He meant that he had erased all the evidence.

No matter how capable Christina was, she couldn't uncover everything in such a short time.

Just then, Christina pointed to the big screen.

"Why the rush?"

"Did you really think I'd confront you without being prepared?"

"When you dragged me out to sea, did you think I'd just disappear without a trace?"

"That seawater was salty and freezing. I thought I wouldn't make it."

"But maybe even God couldn't stand it and decided I shouldn't die unjustly. I came back to bring the culprits to justice."

Online viewers were in disbelief.

"Oh my God."

"Is this real? If it is, they're truly evil."

"Yeah, from what Christina said, it sounds terrifying."

"I know that area of the sea. Hardly anyone goes there. Maybe it really was divine intervention."

Parker gritted his teeth upon hearing this.

"I don't believe your evidence is flawless, so don't get cocky. As long as we don't admit it, it doesn't exist."

Grace, upon hearing the news, was furious and tried to get there, but the crowd was too thick. She could only listen from the sidelines.

Christina, Parker, and Mira were all taken to the police station.

"Cooperate with our investigation, and we'll uncover the truth."

"Of course, we won't wrong an innocent person, nor will we let a guilty one go. So rest assured."

Christina nodded slowly.

"I believe in you."

Christina's belief wasn't in their ability but in the fact that she had already uncovered the truth.

With Christina's evidence, the authorities only needed to do a little digging to uncover the entire chain of evidence.

What seemed like an ordinary beauty salon was actually hiding a massive operation.

"Oh my God, really? My relatives often go there for treatments."

"Who would've thought a murder investigation would uncover such a mess."

"Exactly, we all thought the salon was fine, but now this. It's shocking!"

Everyone was talking at once.

Christina, having provided the evidence and being a victim herself, went home.

When she got home, she saw William with Harper at the door.

"Mommy."

Harper ran to Christina as soon as he saw her.

All of Christina's exhaustion vanished at that moment.

"Harper, have you been good? Did you miss Mommy?"

"I missed you, Mommy. Daddy said you'd be back soon."

Hearing the word "Daddy," Christina's brow furrowed slightly.

Though it was fine for Harper to know who his father was, Christina couldn't forget what happened in her past life.

"Thank you for taking care of Harper."

Christina said, ready to walk past William into the house.

William wanted to show concern but didn't know how to start.

Hearing Christina's story had pained him deeply.

He didn't know how she survived, but he knew it must have been tough.

"Don't worry, I'll make Parker pay, and Mira won't get away either."

Christina had already closed the door, and William made his promise through it.

"You don't need to do anything. I have the evidence. The law will make them pay."

###chapter 270  Begging for Mercy

Christina's words left William speechless again.

"What's up?"

"Did I say something wrong?"

"No, are you feeling okay? Do you need to go to the hospital?"

After a long pause, that was all he could manage.

"No, I'm fine."

With the investigation still ongoing, Parker and the others were temporarily off the hook.

The police had found some new clues, but they were different from the previous ones.

Raymond was livid when he heard about it.

"What the hell are you all doing?"

"We're family, for crying out loud. Christina's married to William, so we can't just ignore this. How could you be so reckless?"

Mira was visibly upset at his words.

"What do you mean, reckless? I had to make this choice for the kids. Besides, what's done is done. How do you expect us to fix it now?"

Raymond was even more infuriated by Mira's response.

"Your choices are your own, but why drag the kids into it?"

If Parker hadn't gotten mixed up in this mess, there might not have been any issues. Now, not only were things spiraling out of control, but they were also tangled up with the law.

"Dad, stop it."

"This isn't Mom's fault. I wanted to deal with Christina myself. If you want to blame someone, blame Christina. It's obvious now, isn't it?"

Raymond sighed deeply.

"If you put it that way, there's nothing I can do. The evidence is clear, just like it was back then. I can't keep holding a grudge."

Parker's face was serious, and Raymond sighed again.

"Fine, whatever. If you think I'm talking nonsense, then handle it yourselves."

Two days later, the police had gathered all the necessary evidence.

"Let's go arrest them."

"Since the motive for murder is clear, we need to give everyone an explanation."

People online were buzzing with curiosity about the case and wanted to know what had happened.

Compared to previous cases, this one was even more baffling.

Christina believed the authorities would provide answers, so she sent the detective away.

The Duke called when he heard about it.

"I thought you'd use my people more, but you haven't changed a bit."

Christina sighed.

"This is just how I am."

"Why do you make it seem like I've done something wrong?"

"Am I wrong? You only take me seriously in those moments. It's like I never have a real place in your life."

Christina didn't respond.

They chatted about other things before hanging up.

After Parker was taken away, Christina went to the authorities to provide more information.

"I never thought you'd try to harm me when we had no beef. You were pretty ruthless back then, saying you wouldn't let me live. But you didn't expect I'd make it to today."

Seeing Christina's smug face, Parker was livid.

"I should've finished you off back then."

"That way, you wouldn't have survived. My mistake for being too soft."

"I wanted to leave you in one piece, but it backfired. Don't worry, if I get another chance, I won't let you be so cocky."

Parker's voice was low, only Christina could hear.

Christina chuckled.

"Let's see if you can get out. I'm known for holding grudges. Since you're so curious, let's see what happens now."

Parker was seething but helpless as the police took him away.

After he was taken away, Christina stepped outside.

A crowd had gathered, curious about how the case would be handled.

"I know everyone is curious, but I can't say much. We'll leave it to the police. I dislike these people and think they went too far, but I won't seek private revenge. I hope no one follows their example. It's wrong."

The authorities nodded in approval at Christina's words.

"Christina is right. Don't follow bad examples. We live in a society governed by law. Let's resolve issues without resorting to violence. Once a life is lost, it's too late for regrets."

The crowd murmured, feeling sorry for Parker's fate.

As Christina left, Raymond stopped her.

"Christina, Parker made a mistake. Can you forgive him?"

"If you sign a letter of forgiveness, Parker won't be in trouble. You can name your terms."

"We only have these two children."

Raymond's plea was sincere, but Christina laughed.

"You only have two children, but I only have one life."

"Why didn't you beg me to spare Mira?"

Raymond's face darkened at Christina's sarcasm.

"I know Mira did wrong and deserves punishment, but Parker just made a mistake. He doesn't deserve such a harsh penalty."

Christina sneered.

"That's funny. You think this isn't serious? You overestimate yourselves. I didn't care about your family before, but you tried to kill me. Now I'm just fighting back."

Ignoring Raymond's protests, Christina walked away.

After she left, Grace arrived.

"Dad, why did you say that?"

"Do you really think that cruel woman Christina will show mercy? If she would, Parker wouldn't be in trouble."

"What do we do now? This isn't what I wanted. I said we shouldn't let things get this bad. But Mom and my brother wouldn't listen."

"Forget it, don't say more."

Grace was furious, feeling that Christina had torn their family apart.

When Christina got home, she felt deflated.

Though the matter was settled, she couldn't feel happy.

"Mom, what's wrong?"

Harper noticed Christina's mood and came over to ask.

###chapter 271 Maintenance

"Mom's fine, just a bit tired lately. Harper, why don't you go play by yourself for a bit?"

Christina's nerves were on edge until this whole ordeal was over.

It wasn't until Parker and his crew were behind bars that Christina could finally relax. Now that these issues were resolved, she still couldn't find peace.

Because aside from this, she had many other things to deal with.

"Got it, Mom," Harper replied.

Christina looked at Harper with a sense of relief.

After resting at home for a few days, Christina returned to work, but she had fallen behind due to the previous situation.

"Is this really the best your company can offer me?"

"Even though there's nothing technically wrong, I've considered all these details, but I still think it's unacceptable."

Upon returning to the office, Christina's assistant mentioned that the partner was difficult to deal with, so Christina decided to handle it herself.

"If you have any thoughts, just say them. There's no need to make things difficult. The situation is what it is, what more do you want?"

"I think we should discuss this face-to-face. I'm aware of Ms. Windsor's capabilities. If we're not satisfied, we'll have to find another partner. I've given you ample time, and this is the result? How can we be satisfied?"

Christina fell silent because the partner was right.

If she hadn't encountered these setbacks, the proposal should have been submitted by now.

Since Christina's return, William had hardly seen Harper.

He was waiting outside Christina's office building as usual when he overheard her assistant discussing the matter.

"Even though the boss has tried her best, the partner is just too difficult."

"Yeah, if we can't secure this deal, future collaborations will be tough. Our influence in the industry is significant."

"But everyone has their own opinions. I really don't know what to do."

"Are you suggesting we beg the partner? If they don't listen to the boss, why would they listen to us?"

They were so engrossed in their discussion that they didn't notice William getting out of his car.

"What's going on?" William asked, trying to sound as gentle as possible.

But they were still startled.

"Mr. Cavendish-"

"Did I scare you? Sorry."

William gave a tired smile.

They quickly shook their heads.

"It's nothing, just some minor issues at the company. Are you here to see the boss?"

Due to previous events, they all knew William and Christina were married.

So William coming to see Christina wasn't surprising, though Christina's cold demeanor was.

"Yes, I'm here to see your boss. What were you talking about?"

They exchanged glances and then looked back at William, their eyes lighting up.

"Mr. Cavendish, with your connections, solving these problems should be a breeze."

As William looked puzzled, they quickly explained the situation to him. The proposal could have been approved, but Grace had pressured the partner.

"I've done my best, but I can't guarantee the outcome."

"I don't care. Just make sure Christina doesn't succeed."

"Don't forget, I have leverage over you."

Grace usually didn't get involved in company matters, but after Parker's incident, she had to step in and used some underhanded tactics to gain leverage over the partner.

"I get it. I'll do my best, but please keep the leverage confidential."

"Of course. As long as you handle this, there won't be any issues."

Christina was still upstairs working overtime.

She thought if this path was blocked, she'd just find another one.

She didn't have many options, and the subsequent matters were unrelated.

Christina and a few employees were working.

After hearing about the situation, they frowned deeply.

"Boss, maybe we should find another partner. This one has been acting strange. They were easy to deal with before, but after that incident, they've been difficult."

"Yeah, I don't think we need to work with them."

Christina waved her hand and rubbed her temples.

"I agree, but this contract has been in progress for so long. We've wasted so many opportunities to negotiate other deals."

"I don't want to give up just yet. Let's try again."

Downstairs, William frowned deeply after hearing their explanation.

"I didn't expect this. I understand now. I can handle it."

"Please help arrange a meeting with your boss."

He seemed a bit embarrassed as he said this.

They quickly nodded.

"Don't worry, we know there might be some misunderstandings between you and the boss. It would be great if you could resolve them."

"Yeah, you two are perfect for each other. You should be together."

William felt a bit happier hearing this.

"Thank you. I'll treat you to coffee."

They were a bit taken aback, but William was pleased.

Through his pressure, Christina got a chance to meet with the partner.

But when she arrived, she found William there, along with several other industry bigwigs.

"I think Ms. Windsor is very talented. Working with her would be great. How could you miss that?"

The person being addressed looked helpless.

It wasn't up to him. If he didn't have leverage held by Grace, he wouldn't miss the chance to work with Christina.

"You don't understand. Everyone has their own thoughts, and there are many details that aren't right."

Even under William's pressure, he had to nitpick.

William had asked for a chance, not a complete denial.

Christina arrived and saw the scene, her expression darkening.

Though they hadn't said anything, the environment clearly indicated William's involvement.

"Everyone, considering my relationship with Christina, I don't think there should be any issues working with her."

William's words shocked everyone.

They thought he was just asking them to review Christina's proposal and sign it if suitable, but he was directly pushing for it.

Christina frowned deeply.

Ignoring their identities, she refused in front of everyone.

"No need to worry, Mr. Cavendish. I'll handle my own affairs."

"Yeah, Mr. Cavendish, your relationship is making us a bit uncomfortable."

One of the bosses spoke up to ease the tension.

William stared at Christina for a few moments before turning to the speaker.

"What? Do I need your permission to help my wife?"

###chapter 272 Slim Chances of Victory

Everyone froze when those words were spoken.

All eyes turned to the partner who had initially given Christina a hard time.

If it weren't for the inappropriate setting, they would have teased him a bit, saying he must be quite the character to deliberately make things difficult for William's wife.

The partner's face fell, and he cursed Grace repeatedly in his mind.

If it weren't for that damned woman Grace, he wouldn't have nitpicked in the first place. Now, look at the mess he's in-he's offended William!

Of course, the most important thing now was to mend the relationship. The partner raised his glass, "Ms. Windsor, I mean Mrs. Cavendish, we've had some misunderstandings. I'll drink three glasses as an apology. I'll finish them, and you can drink as you please."

He downed three glasses in a row and then showered Christina with praise.

As for the collaboration, it was perfectly resolved. Now, even if he had the courage, he wouldn't dare to nitpick anymore.

But Christina wasn't happy.

Listening to everyone wishing them a lifetime of happiness and calling them a perfect match, she felt a lump in her throat.

But she couldn't lose her temper in this setting.

After finally enduring the dinner and seeing everyone off, Christina got up to leave.

William naturally followed, "Christina, let me drive you home."

"William, why did you take it upon yourself to help me?" Christina stopped and turned to him, "This is my issue, and I can handle it myself. Even if the collaboration falls through, the loss is mine to bear. What does it have to do with you?"

Yes, William had solved a big problem for her, and she should be grateful.

But did she need his help?

What kind of help was this, forced upon her?

"Christina, I did take it upon myself this time. You don't need to feel any burden, and I don't expect anything in return. I did it willingly." William genuinely had no intention of seeking repayment.

In his past life, he owed Christina and Harper too much. In this life, he just wanted to do everything he could to make their lives better, even a little bit better.

Christina didn't believe him at all, "I don't care what you're thinking. I just hope you stay out of my life as much as possible. You helped organize today's dinner, and I'll repay you."

No matter how much profit she made from this project, she would give every penny to William.

William would never take her money.

For those without money, money is everything. But for him, his wife and child were the most important. These feelings couldn't be bought with money.

"Christina..."

He wanted to say more, but Christina had already turned and left.

Back home, Christina played with Harper for a while and then read her a bedtime story.

"Goodnight, Mommy." Harper quickly closed her eyes and fell into a deep sleep.

Listening to her daughter's steady breathing, Christina thought about many things.

She didn't want the title "Mrs. Cavendish" or any connection to him. The best solution was to file for divorce.

Once she had the divorce certificate, they would truly be strangers, and Harper would be her daughter alone.

With this in mind, Christina went to see a lawyer the next morning to discuss the divorce.

The lawyer first asked about their marital status, then paused and shook his head, "Ms. Windsor, you're my client, and I shouldn't ask this, but I have to. Is this divorce absolutely necessary?"

"Yes." Christina's attitude was firm, "This divorce is absolutely necessary. I hired you to get the divorce certificate. Money is not an issue."

"To be honest, the chances of winning this divorce case are slim." The lawyer analyzed the situation for her.

"First, your husband isn't at fault. He hasn't betrayed the relationship. Plus, you have a child together, and I heard you say the child has contact with your husband. With the new marriage laws, divorce is much harder. One lawsuit won't be enough."

"What about two lawsuits?" Christina didn't care how troublesome it was.

As long as she could get divorced, even if it took a year or more, she was willing.

She had many years ahead of her. Spending a year to solve a big problem was worth it.

"Well..." The lawyer looked troubled.

He didn't say anything, but his expression told Christina everything.

She hadn't expected that getting a divorce would be so difficult.

The lawyer then added, "Ms. Windsor, you mentioned you want to fight for your daughter's custody. I don't know what your husband thinks, but if he wants to fight for custody, the chances of you getting it are very low."

"How can that be?" Christina was stunned, "I've been taking care of my daughter all these years. He missed her entire early childhood."

Could it be that just because William had seen Harper a few times since she returned, he could rightfully take her away?

What kind of logic was that!

The lawyer had handled many divorce cases and understood Christina's thoughts, "The law isn't up to us. Custody depends on which parent can provide a better living environment. Your husband's financial situation is much better than yours. If the child were under three, it would be easier."

Hearing this, Christina felt only deep disappointment.

She didn't know how she left the law office.

Sitting in her car, she replayed the lawyer's words over and over.

When she left with Harper years ago, she had only one thought: to completely escape William.

She thought that after a few years, William would remarry, maybe even have three kids.

He didn't love her, so how could he wait for her?

Who knew things would turn out like this?

William had promised her that no matter what, he wouldn't fight for the child. But promises were just words.

Changing his mind was just a matter of a single thought.

Considering Harper's custody, Christina had to put the divorce on hold. She needed to earn more money, so that if she had to go to court, her chances would be better.

Just then, her phone rang. It was Mia calling, "Christina, are you free now? Can we meet? I have something to discuss with you."

"Sure, I'm on my way." Christina drove to the address Mia had given her.

It was a large hotel, one of Mia's properties.

###chapter 273 She Is the Mistress's Daughter

As the boss, Mia made a quick call and reserved the penthouse suite.

She sat in the suite, waiting for Christina.

It wasn't long before Christina arrived. She pushed open the door and, upon seeing Mia, almost didn't recognize her.

Mia had changed so much.

When they first met, Mia was vibrant and full of energy. Even when she faced betrayal in her relationship, she never wallowed in self-pity.

But now, despite still wearing designer clothes, Mia looked drained and lifeless.

"Christina, it's just the two of us here. No need for formalities. Sit wherever you like and order whatever you want."

Christina pulled out a chair and sat down, ordering a few dishes.

Once the food was served, they exchanged a few pleasantries before Christina asked, "Have you been dealing with something stressful lately?"

"Yes, I" Mia's eyes reddened as she spoke.

"My dad passed away last year, and my mom died five months ago. Now it's just me and my daughter."

Losing her closest loved ones in such a short time was a heavy blow.

Christina didn't know what to say, so she just stayed with Mia, letting her vent her emotions.

After a while, Mia wiped her tears and sniffled. "You know my family situation. I was their only child, spoiled and given the best of everything. Before my mom died, she held my hand and told me to run the company well and take care of my daughter."

"I've been working at the company for the past two years. Managing it is tough, but not impossible. Yet, the senior executives who watched me grow up are now turning against me, trying to push me out."

The things they said disgusted Mia.

They told her that as a woman, she didn't need to work hard, just enjoy life. Sure, she had enough money to live comfortably, but she wasn't about to hand over her parents' legacy to a bunch of wolves.

No matter how tough it got, she was determined to keep the company. "So, I signed a bet-on agreement with them. If I can generate enough profit for the company in six months, they'll acknowledge me. If not, I have to leave and sell my shares to them."

By this point, Christina understood why Mia had called her. "You want me to help you secure a deal?"

Mia nodded.

They had known each other for a long time and had worked together many times. Mia trusted Christina's capabilities.

"Most importantly, you won't betray me or be an inside man for them." Mia handed Christina a document. "If you can help me secure this deal, I'll win. Christina, will you help me?"

Not wanting to pressure Christina, Mia added, "If you don't want to, that's fine. I won't force you. Even if you agree and the deal doesn't go through, it just means I wasn't capable enough."

Mia wasn't one to make unreasonable demands.

She had done everything she could for this bet-on agreement. Now, she could only hope for the best.

Christina didn't answer immediately.

She carefully reviewed the project, not missing a single detail. After finishing, she looked up. "Mia, I can help you, but I'm only seventy percent sure I can secure this deal."

"Seventy percent is already very high. You don't need to feel any pressure, really." Mia smiled at her. "I'm very grateful you're helping me in my time of need."

"We're friends. Plus, if I help you land this deal, I'll make some money too. It's a win-win," Christina said, not hiding her own situation from Mia.

"I'm trying to get a divorce, but my husband's financial situation is way better than mine. Fighting for custody is tough."

Mia didn't know what to say.

She sighed. "We're both in tough spots, dealing with the wrong people. I can't help much, but money is no issue. After this bet-on agreement, we can work together again, and I won't take a penny. All the profits will go to you."

Within her means, Mia wanted to help Christina as much as she could.

Christina didn't refuse.

After their meal, she returned to her office, continued researching the project, and came up with several plans. Then she called the project company's chairman's secretary to schedule a meeting for the next morning.

Before the meeting, Christina was confident about securing the project.

She had only mentioned seventy percent to Mia because she didn't like making promises she couldn't keep.

But she didn't expect to see Parker next to Sunshine Corporation's executive, Atlas!

After her mother's case was resolved, Mira was sentenced to death, and Parker got five years in prison. She didn't expect him to be out so soon!

Seeing an enemy always stirs strong emotions. Christina knew Parker must have pulled some strings to get out early, but there was nothing she could do now. Parker hated her and wouldn't miss any chance to cause trouble.

For now, she had to take things one step at a time. Eventually, she'd find a way to put him back in prison.

Today, Atlas was the client, and Parker was his friend, which wasn't good for Christina.

"Ms. Windsor, I'm impressed you're so young and already in charge. Quite an achievement." Atlas didn't know about the history between Parker and Christina.

Since Christina was there to discuss a deal, he made some polite remarks. Whether the deal would go through was another matter, but he didn't like making enemies.

Christina greeted him politely and sat across from them.

She expected Parker to cause trouble, but he hadn't done anything yet, so she couldn't start a confrontation.

Just as Christina was about to present her proposal, Parker interrupted, "Atlas, I remember two other companies also showed interest in working with you. How about we meet them later?"

"Those companies are a bit small and don't quite meet my needs. I'd like to hear Ms. Windsor's ideas first." Atlas was surprised by Parker's lack of tact.

Comparing options is normal in business, but not in front of Christina. It was rude.

"Company size doesn't matter as much as integrity." Parker's comment was pointed.

Atlas sensed something was off but didn't dwell on it.

After discussing the project and finishing their drinks, Christina went to get more wine.

While she was gone, Parker told Atlas, "She's the daughter of a mistress. Aren't you worried about being betrayed by someone like her?"

Atlas hesitated.

Being the daughter of a mistress was indeed distasteful, but Christina's proposal was excellent.

###chapter 274  Poor Alcohol Tolerance

If they switched to a different partner, the proposed plan might not meet his expectations.

Profit was the most important thing in a partnership. He was a businessman, not a moral judge. With that in mind, Atlas's internal scale was gradually tipping towards Christina.

Of course, he couldn't openly tell Parker this.

He sighed, looking troubled. "Mr. Cavendish, you know I'm just a department head. I still have to follow my boss's instructions. If we just give up on this partnership, it puts me in a tough spot."

Everyone present was smart. Parker understood what Atlas was implying.

Saying it was difficult rather than impossible meant there was room for negotiation.

Parker smiled. "For the deal we've been discussing recently, I'm willing to give you an extra half percent profit."

Half a percent profit!

Atlas's breath quickened. He tried to calm himself down and not lose his composure. "Mr. Cavendish, you can't be joking with me, right?"

"Absolutely not. I keep my word." Parker's assurance put Atlas at ease.

Initially, Parker wanted Atlas to refuse to work with Christina. But then he thought, even if Atlas refused, Christina could still find someone else to partner with.

In that case, he would be giving up half a percent profit for nothing, which would be too advantageous for Christina.

"As for this project, how about this: Atlas, you hand it over to me. I'll be the main party responsible, and I'll take on all the risks and rewards."

"Sure, Mr. Cavendish. Since you asked, I'll definitely follow your lead." Atlas agreed without hesitation.

Although handing over the project meant the company would earn less, projects had their ups and downs. Who could guarantee this one would be a big success?

On the other hand, the deal he had with Parker was clearly written in black and white. Parker was willing to give him an extra half percent profit, which was solid and risk-free.

Trading a risky project for guaranteed profit, and using this opportunity to strengthen his relationship with Parker-why not?

When Christina returned, Atlas's demeanor had changed.

He leaned back in his chair, showing little interest in the project. "Ms. Windsor, it's already late. Let's not talk business now. Let's have dinner first and sign the contract tomorrow after we've enjoyed ourselves."

Christina felt his attitude wasn't quite right for a business discussion.

But the client was always right. She couldn't force the conversation.

Parker kept pushing drinks on her, with Atlas occasionally chiming in.

"Ms. Windsor, if we're discussing a partnership, we should have the right attitude. We've both been drinking, but you're not. Isn't that a bit unfair?"

"I felt a connection with you the moment we met. If we enjoy tonight's dinner, I'll definitely agree to sign the contract tomorrow."

"I love drinking. It's my only hobby. Please understand, Ms. Windsor."

If Christina couldn't see they were teaming up against her, she would have wasted all her years of experience.

Christina endured and drank who knows how much until she felt dizzy.

But Parker wasn't done.

He had the waiter bring two bottles of strong liquor, placing one in front of Christina and splitting the other between himself and Atlas.

He raised his glass. "Christina, since you can drink so well, why don't we drink straight from the bottle?"

"I can do anything, but it has to be fair. If I drink from the bottle and you two use glasses, isn't that a bit unfair?" Christina protested.

It was bad enough they were forcing drinks on her, but now they were cheating. How was that fair?

Parker's smile deepened. "If you really can't accept it, we can cancel the partnership. You can leave anytime."

After all, Christina was the one seeking the partnership. They could do whatever they wanted.

Christina fell silent.

For any other project, she would have walked away. But this one was crucial for Mia's agreement.

Since she had agreed to it, she had to do her best. She couldn't afford to be petty.

She had to play by their rules.

Of course, she didn't forget to text her assistant: [I'm in a business meeting and can't leave. Please pick up Harper for me.]

After arranging for her daughter, Christina continued drinking with the two men.

In the end, Parker couldn't drink anymore.

He gritted his teeth, refusing to admit defeat. Losing to a woman, especially after cheating, would be too humiliating.

He had to outdrink Christina.

But the next moment, he passed out on the table.

Atlas wasn't much better off. His face was red, and he waved his hand. "No more, no more. Let's call it a night."

If they kept drinking, he feared he would end up like Parker, passed out and vulnerable.

Christina still had some sense left, but she was in no condition to drive. Luckily, there was a ride service outside the hotel. She closed her eyes and rested on the way home.

She had put her phone on silent during the meeting and didn't notice the numerous messages and missed calls from her assistant.

It wasn't until the driver stopped outside her building. "Ma'am, we're here. Please pay the fare."

After paying, Christina went upstairs, but Harper wasn't there.

The apartment was empty.

Where was Harper?

Christina was instantly wide awake. She checked her phone and saw the messages from her assistant.

[Ms. Windsor, there was a last-minute meeting. I'll be late picking up Harper.]

[I'm at the daycare now, but Harper's not here. The security said Harper's dad picked him up. Did he contact you?]

[Ms. Windsor, please answer my calls.]

And several missed calls.

Panic surged through Christina. Was it William who picked up Harper, or a stranger?

If it was the latter, the consequences would be unimaginable!

She stumbled out the door to find Harper, but as she reached the ground floor, she saw William's car.

He rolled down the window, revealing his handsome face.

###chapter 275  Belated Warmth

"Where's Harper? Did you pick her up?" Christina rushed over, her voice tinged with panic.

She glanced into the car, but the passenger seat and back seats were empty. No sign of Harper.

William caught a whiff of alcohol on her breath and frowned. "Christina, how much did you drink?"

Luckily, he had passed by Harper's preschool that evening and noticed all the other kids had been picked up. Harper was standing alone at the gate, so he decided to take her home and then come find Christina.

Otherwise, with Christina this drunk, she couldn't even take care of herself, let alone Harper.

"Where did you take Harper?" Christina's voice was frantic, her only concern finding her daughter.

Her eyes were filled with anxiety. "Are you doing this on purpose? Trying to take her away from me to win custody?"

"Christina, why do you always assume the worst about me?" William felt a pang of sadness.

He had only ever wanted to make things right with Christina, never to cause her distress.

Even for Harper's sake, he would never do such a thing.

"Harper is my daughter too. I want her to grow up healthy, with both a mom and a dad. Trust me, I won't fight you for custody."

"Stop talking so much. Just tell me where Harper is!" Christina was on the verge of tears.

She didn't want to hear anything else, just wanted to see her daughter.

"Harper is at my place. She's fine. Calm down and get in the car. I'll take you to her."

"You're not lying, right?" Christina asked again.

It wasn't until William showed her a video of Harper on his phone that she finally opened the car door and got in.

On the way to the Cavendish Mansion, Christina was exhausted but forced herself to stay awake.

She wouldn't be at ease until she saw Harper with her own eyes.

Finally, the car stopped outside the mansion. William got out and walked around to open her door. "Can you walk?"

"Of course I can." Christina ignored his outstretched hand.

It was completely dark now, and she was so drunk that she almost tripped over her own feet.

Luckily, William was watching her closely and caught her around the waist, preventing her from falling.

Before she could steady herself, he scooped her up in his arms.

"Put me down!" Christina immediately started to struggle.

But William held her tightly. "You're so drunk. If I let you walk, you'd fall a dozen times. Just be good and let me carry you."

"I don't need your help!"

Christina didn't want any physical contact with him.

Even falling would be better than being held by him. It made her feel extremely uncomfortable.

"Fine, I'll help you walk. Harper is inside. If you fall and get dirty, it wouldn't be good for her to see." William took a step back.

Christina reluctantly nodded.

The walk through the garden felt endless to her. Finally, she reached out and pushed open the front door.

"Is that Mommy?" Harper heard the door and ran over excitedly.

She hugged Christina with her bare feet. "Mommy, I missed you so much."

Christina scooped up her precious daughter, finally feeling a sense of relief. Thank goodness Harper was okay.

"Mommy, you smell like alcohol," Harper said, wrinkling her nose. "I don't want you to drink anymore."

Every time her mom drank, Harper felt awful. Sometimes Christina would even throw up in the middle of the night, and Harper could only watch, feeling helpless and worried.

"Sweetie, Mommy's back now. Go upstairs and get some rest. We'll talk in the morning, okay?" William reached out to Harper.

He had planned to put Harper to bed before going to get Christina, but Harper was very attached to her mom and refused to sleep without seeing her.

Harper nodded. "Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?"

Christina usually slept with her daughter, but considering how much she had drunk, she might throw up at night and didn't want to disturb her daughter. "Sweetie, tonight you sleep by yourself. Mommy will sleep with you another time."

"Okay, I'll go wash up. Goodnight, Mommy. Goodnight, Dad Cavendish." Harper ran off to her room, which William had designed to her liking.

After Harper left, William turned to Christina. "You should sleep in the master bedroom tonight. It's more spacious. I'll sleep in the study."

The master bedroom was his usual place, but Christina didn't want to go there. "Any guest room will do, or I can sleep on the couch."

She planned to leave with her daughter once she sobered up the next day.

William wouldn't let her sleep on the couch and led her to a guest room. "Everything you need is here. The housekeeper is off today. If you need anything, just call me."

"Thanks," Christina said, just wanting to lie down.

As soon as her head hit the pillow, she fell into a deep sleep. In the middle of the night, her stomach discomfort woke her.

She instinctively reached for the trash can by the bed and threw up for a long time, emptying her stomach.

A voice came from beside her. "Drink some honey water. It'll help your stomach feel better."

She looked up in surprise. "What are you doing here?"

"I was heading to the kitchen for a snack and heard you throwing up, so I came to check on you." William didn't tell the whole truth.

He knew she'd feel awful after drinking so much and wanted to be there to take care of her.

Christina took the honey water from him and drank a few sips, feeling a bit better.

"Rest a bit more. If you can't get up in the morning, I'll take Harper to school. You can sleep in." William stayed with her for a while before leaving.

Christina remembered setting an alarm, but she had been so exhausted lately that she slept through it.

When she finally woke up, it was already eight in the morning.

She quickly got up and washed, finding a note in the living room: [I took Harper to school. Breakfast is on the dining table. Make sure you eat.]

In the dining room, she saw all her favorite foods.

But what good were these belated gestures?

She wouldn't develop feelings for William because of them.

###chapter 276 That is Mrs. Cavendish

William had already dropped Harper off at kindergarten.

Standing at the school gate, he waved at Harper, "Go on, have a great day at school."

"Bye, Dad Cavendish." Harper greeted him but didn't leave immediately. She thought for a moment and ran back.

"Are you picking me up after school today?"

"Do you want me to, sweetie?" William squatted down and gently pinched Harper's cheek.

Harper nodded.

She had a natural affection for William, and he had always been exceptionally kind to her.

Kids are simple; they trust those who treat them well.

William extended his pinky finger for a promise, "Alright, it's a deal. I'll definitely come to pick you up tonight."

"Okay, I'm off to school now!" Harper ran into the school cheerfully.

William returned to his car and sent a message to Christina: [Dropped Harper off at school. Don't worry, and make sure to eat breakfast, or your stomach will hurt.]

After seeing the message, Christina set her phone aside.

For a moment, she felt conflicted. Raising a child alone always had its challenges, but having two parents would make things much easier.

Harper really did need her father.

But every time she thought about this, memories of her past life would surface, reminding her of William's coldness, and her rationality would return.

After eating a few sandwiches, Christina put down her fork. She had a busy day ahead, with a contract to sign with Atlas.

They had arranged to meet at a club, and Christina, dressed in professional attire, arrived early.

She waited in the lobby for two hours but never saw Atlas.

During this time, she sent messages to Atlas. Initially, he replied with excuses about being stuck in traffic, but eventually, he stopped responding altogether.

It was clear he was playing games with her.

But since she was already there, leaving without accomplishing anything felt like giving up.

Christina waited a bit longer, and finally, Parker arrived.

He walked up to her, looking her up and down, "Since you're here, come upstairs with me."

Suppressing her frustration, Christina followed him to a private room.

Once inside, Parker sat on the couch, "What are you standing there for? Don't you know to get me a glass of water?"

"Parker, don't you think you're being a bit too much?" Christina couldn't hold back any longer.

Yesterday, he had forced her to drink excessively, and now he wanted her to serve him water. What would he demand next?

Parker casually tapped his right hand on the table, "What's the matter? Can't handle it? You're the daughter of a mistress, and I'm just giving you a hard time. Are you already falling apart?"

"I don't want to argue with you. When is Atlas coming?"

"See this contract? The party listed as 'A' has been changed to me." Parker pulled the contract from his bag and tossed it in front of Christina.

He was clearly reveling in his moment of triumph, "If you want this deal, you'll have to negotiate with me, Christina. Don't tell me you're planning to give up."

Christina recalled Atlas's change in attitude during yesterday's dinner. It all made sense now.

Atlas didn't care about the project anymore because he had already decided to hand it over. Whether it was profitable or not didn't matter to him, so he didn't need to put in any effort.

Christina was determined to secure this project, but she didn't want to lower herself too much.

Parker's presence today indicated the situation.

"If you had a better partner, you wouldn't be here today. You've seen my proposal; cooperation is mutually beneficial."

Parker's expression darkened.

He hated Christina's confident demeanor, "You can sign the contract, but there's a clause that says you must provide a satisfactory plan after the collaboration, or the party listed as 'A' can refuse payment."

This clause was like a ticking time bomb, ready to explode at any moment.

Christina couldn't change the rules of the game; she could only choose whether to comply.

After handing the project to Parker, Atlas had more free time and often went fishing with friends.

Most of them were in the same industry, with business connections and good personal relationships.

As they chatted, the conversation turned to the project Atlas had handed over.

"Atlas, you were swamped with that project recently. How come you're so relaxed now, even going fishing?" The speaker was Bodhi, the partner who had previously given Christina a hard time.

Since then, Bodhi had been on edge, fearing William might retaliate for his wife's sake.

He agreed to go fishing with Atlas to unwind.

Atlas smiled smugly, "I handed the project over to Parker, the Cavendish family's young master. Not only did I earn his favor, but I also get half the profits for free. It's a win-win."

He adjusted his fishing rod, seeing a fish bite, and hurriedly reeled it in.

The next moment, the fish slipped off the hook.

Bodhi watched Atlas, his brows furrowing. He felt a sense of déjà vu.

"Atlas, we're all businessmen. There's no such thing as a free lunch. Parker wouldn't give you such a big benefit without a reason."

"He has a grudge against my partner and wants to use this opportunity to mess with her." Atlas could guess that much.

But what did it matter to him?

He only cared about the tangible benefits he received.

Bodhi was silent for a moment, "Who's your partner?"

"Bodhi, what's with you today? We're here to relax, don't be so tense." Atlas patted his shoulder, "My partner is Christina. Do you know her?"

The project was already handed over, and even if Bodhi had a connection, Atlas couldn't go back and offend Parker.

Now, not only Bodhi but the others also looked at him, shaking their heads.

Atlas was puzzled by their reactions.

The next moment, Bodhi patted his shoulder, "Do you know who Christina is? She's William's wife. If you want to get close to the Cavendish family, you should be pleasing her. Look at what you've done."

"Mrs. Cavendish?" Atlas's eyes widened.

For a moment, he thought Bodhi was joking, "Don't scare me. This isn't a joke. I've never heard of William having a wife."

Bodhi sighed, "Well, now you know. And you've just handed over a project that could have been your ticket in with the Cavendish family. Good luck dealing with that fallout."

###chapter 277: Round and Round, It's All Him

"Who's kidding around?" Bodhi's face turned serious. "I'm dead serious."

Atlas still couldn't quite believe him.

Then someone nearby chimed in, "Atlas, you and Bodhi really are best friends, you both fell into the same trap!"

Atlas felt his brain buzz.

Bodhi shook his head and said, "Mr. Cavendish told me himself, it's not a lie. I even checked it out when I got home. A few years ago, Christina was rumored to be involved with Mr. Cavendish."

The internet is full of traces, and he specifically looked into it. What more is there to understand?

Grace and Parker's issues with Christina stem from their parents' grudges. Bodhi didn't want to judge who was right or wrong.

The bottom line is, William's wife is Christina, and that's all he needs to know.

"But Atlas, there's still a difference between us."

"What difference?" Atlas asked instinctively.

"I'm working well with Mrs. Cavendish now, but you've already sent out that contract. I don't know if there's a chance to salvage it." Bodhi sighed.

To be fair, Christina's proposal was excellent, but they kept causing trouble.

Even the most patient person would have a hard time putting up with it.

Given how much William values his wife, if she complains to him, do you think William would tolerate it?

Just thinking about it made Atlas feel like he was going to collapse.

He's done for!

He lost all interest in fishing, quickly putting down his rod. "I have some things to take care of, let's reschedule."

He had verbally agreed with Parker yesterday, but the contract hadn't been finalized, the seal hadn't been stamped, so there was still a chance!

He drove hurriedly to the club.

Christina was suppressing her anger. If it weren't for Mia, she would have already confronted Parker.

"State all your demands at once, don't play games with me."

"What?" Parker interrupted Christina with a chuckle. "Don't you deserve to be toyed with?"

Christina was Elisa's daughter, and Elisa was a mistress.

If it weren't for Elisa, his father wouldn't have divorced his mother. Now Elisa is dead, and his mother is dead too. He wants Christina to pay for it all.

Parker's face turned ugly. "Christina, your mom deserved to die. You've managed to stay with William for so long, you must have some skills! But our grudge isn't over yet!"

She managed to get William to marry her, have a daughter, and even make William devoted to her. That's Christina's skill!

Christina's tone remained cold. "Since you know my skills and that William will help me, why are you still causing trouble? Aren't you afraid he'll punish you?"

Christina looked at Parker, her eyes showing a hint of provocation.

Parker understood her meaning clearly.

"William will help you, but how can he help with our cooperation? Christina, if you want to proceed, you have to meet my demands. But you also have the right to withdraw anytime, don't you?"

Christina said nothing, her red lips pressed tightly together.

This deal was crucial for Mia; otherwise, Mia wouldn't have come to her.

During the three years she was away from Stargate City, Mia had taken care of her.

"Fine, I'll see it through. But I have to go now. Mr. Parker Cavendish, send me all your demands at once." With that, Christina turned and left.

Just meeting his demands was already tough. Even if Christina showed a strong front now, he wanted to see how long she could keep it up!

Not long after Christina left, Atlas arrived.

Seeing Parker alone, Atlas anxiously looked around. "Where's Christina?"

"Atlas, why are you so eager to find Christina? Is something wrong?"

Parker held his wine glass, smiling faintly.

Seeing Parker like this made Atlas even more anxious. "Mr. Parker Cavendish, I just found out Christina is Mr. William Cavendish's wife. I can't give you this project. If you keep troubling Christina and Mr. William Cavendish comes after me, I'm done for!"

He didn't dare offend William.

William had been ruthless over the years.

Parker thought it was something else, but it turned out Atlas had discovered this.

Parker's face turned very ugly. "You're afraid of offending William, but you're not afraid of offending me?"

Atlas fell silent.

Parker was also part of the Cavendish family. Offending him wouldn't end well for Atlas either. But was this really offending Parker? When Parker approached him, he agreed without hesitation. He could help, but he had to consider his own situation too.

Atlas pursed his lips and said softly, "Mr. Parker Cavendish, I can't risk myself. You know Mr. William Cavendish's methods. I don't want to end up losing everything. Since the seal hasn't been stamped yet, if you need anything in the future, I'll be at your service."

After saying this, Atlas quickly went to contact Christina.

"Ms. Windsor, I apologize for causing you trouble. I didn't know about your relationship with Mr. Parker Cavendish. I'm willing to cooperate on this project!"

Atlas's sudden change in attitude made Christina suspect it was because of William!

"Did your attitude change because you found out about William?"

Christina asked, considering Atlas's reputation. It seemed William had found Atlas, otherwise, Atlas wouldn't have changed his attitude.

Atlas smiled. "I didn't recognize your importance before, Ms. Windsor, or rather Mrs. Cavendish. My apologies."

Just as she expected, Christina said nothing. Mia needed this project, and if she could secure it, what more was there to say?

But she felt a heavy weight in her heart, unable to express it.

She didn't want to have contact with William, but everything still revolved around him!

Even in two lifetimes.

Was she destined to be with William in this life too?

Christina didn't want to think further, sending Mia an "OK" emoji.

###chapter 278: Here We Go Again

Kaitlyn suddenly got a call from Stanley.

Since their divorce, she hadn't heard from him in ages.

Time sure flies. She once thought she couldn't live without him, but in these few short months, she hadn't even thought about him.

After a moment's hesitation, she answered the call.

"What do you want?"

Stanley sounded hesitant, struggling to find his words.

"If you have nothing to say, I'm hanging up," Kaitlyn said impatiently.

"Wait!" Stanley finally spoke up. "I want to see you. We need to talk."

Kaitlyn found it amusing but decided to be patient. "There's nothing left to talk about. We're divorced. Whatever you have to say, just say it over the phone."

Stanley felt like she was a completely different person.

He sighed, lowering his head. "I just want to see you one more time."

Kaitlyn was silent for a moment before speaking softly, "No, I don't want to see you. The best ex is one who might as well be dead."

She was about to hang up when Stanley suddenly asked, "Is this about Irvin?"

"Irvin?" Kaitlyn was momentarily surprised, repeating the name instinctively. Then she realized, "Have you been following me?"

"No," Stanley denied quickly.

Kaitlyn felt a surge of anger. "You have no right to ask me about this. If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up."

She ended the call, but her mind was still unsettled.

What did he mean by that? Was he jealous now? He was the one who had an affair and didn't want to come back. What was there to say now?

Her chest ached with anger, and her stomach felt uncomfortable, a dull pain gnawing at her.

She had plans to go out later, so she took a stomach pill.

She needed to buy a gift for someone, and Irvin was nearby, offering to pick her up when she was done. She agreed happily.

Halfway through her shopping, Stanley appeared out of nowhere.

Kaitlyn was startled. "What are you doing here?"

Stanley bit his lip. "I came to find you."

Kaitlyn frowned, her tone cold. "I told you, there's nothing left to talk about. Your sudden appearance is just bothering me."

Stanley's expression was complicated. He opened his mouth as if to say something but remained silent.

He glanced at the shopping bags in her hand and asked quietly, "Are you buying something? Let me help you."

"This has nothing to do with you," Kaitlyn replied, not wanting to explain further. She turned to leave.

Stanley suddenly grabbed her wrist, not forcefully, but enough to stop her.

Kaitlyn yanked her hand away, her voice tinged with anger. "Stanley, what do you want? We're divorced. You have no right to do this."

Stanley's face paled. He lowered his head, his voice pleading. "Kaitlyn, I know I was wrong. Does it really have to end like this?"

Kaitlyn found it laughable, her eyes full of sarcasm.

"End? Stanley, have you forgotten? You were the one who walked away first. You chose someone else. Now you come back saying this? Isn't it ridiculous?"

Stanley's face grew even paler. He gritted his teeth.

"I know I messed up, but I regret it now. I really regret it, Kaitlyn. I still love you."

Kaitlyn's heart skipped a beat, but she quickly regained her composure, looking at him coldly. "Stanley, do you love me, or do you love the resources I have? I heard you took half of our assets and failed to start a new business."

Stanley's eyes showed a glimmer of hope. "You know about me, so you still care, right?"

Kaitlyn burst out laughing. "I keep tabs on you hoping you'll crash and burn!"

Stanley felt a chill in his heart.

"Kaitlyn, you..."

Seeing the shock in his eyes, Kaitlyn suddenly felt a pang of guilt.

This was the man she had loved for years, her first love. How could she be so heartless?

"If there's nothing else, I'm leaving."

She threw out the words and lowered her head, ready to leave.

Unexpectedly, Stanley stepped forward, grabbing her like a drowning man clutching at straws.

"Kaitlyn, let's talk!"

"Let go! Let go of me," Kaitlyn screamed.

Stanley didn't expect her to react so strongly. He reached out to cover her mouth.

They struggled.

Stanley whispered, "Stop yelling, and I'll let go."

Kaitlyn couldn't calm down. She struggled to break free.

At that moment, Irvin appeared. Seeing the scene, he rushed over without hesitation.

"Kaitlyn!"

Irvin's voice was like a thunderclap, breaking the tension. He quickly pushed Stanley away, standing protectively in front of Kaitlyn, his eyes cold as ice. "Stanley, what the hell are you doing?"

Stanley stumbled back, looking at Irvin with a mix of panic and anger.

He gritted his teeth, his voice bitter. "This is between Kaitlyn and me. It's none of your business!"

"None of my business?" Irvin sneered, his gaze sharp. "Kaitlyn has nothing to do with you anymore. What right do you have to harass her?"

Kaitlyn stood behind Irvin, her heart still racing. But seeing Irvin, she felt a strange sense of calm. She gently tugged on Irvin's sleeve, whispering, "Let's go."

Irvin glanced back at her, his expression softening. He nodded. "Alright, let's go."

Seeing them about to leave, Stanley panicked and rushed at them, landing a punch on Irvin's face.

A man doesn't take a punch without reacting. Irvin punched back, and they started fighting.

"Stop it! Stop fighting!" Kaitlyn shouted, trying to pull them apart.

But she wasn't strong enough to stop two angry men.

Stanley punched Irvin in the stomach. Irvin grunted, stepping back, but quickly retaliated, hitting Stanley's jaw.

Stanley staggered, blood trickling from his mouth, but he didn't stop. He lunged at Irvin even more fiercely.

"Enough!" Kaitlyn screamed. "Stop it, both of you!"

###chapter 279: Got You Involved

Irvin and Stanley were going at it, fists flying, neither one backing down.

Kaitlyn was freaking out, unsure what to do, when security finally showed up.

"Hey! Knock it off!"

When they couldn't break up the fight, one of the guards grabbed his walkie-talkie and called for backup.

A few minutes later, more security guards arrived and managed to pull the enraged Irvin and Stanley apart.

Kaitlyn felt a wave of guilt wash over her when she saw Irvin's bruised face and torn clothes.

She rushed over, "I'm so sorry. This is all my fault, and you got caught up in it."

Irvin wiped the blood from his mouth with his thumb and shot a glare at Stanley, "Guys like him need to be put in their place."

Stanley, already pissed seeing Kaitlyn run to Irvin, was about to explode.

"What did you just say?"

"I said you! You cheated, got divorced, and still harass your ex. Have some self-respect, man!" Irvin, usually calm, had lost it.

His voice was cold, but his eyes were blazing with anger. Stanley's face went pale, his fists clenched, ready to go at it again.

Kaitlyn grabbed Irvin, trying to calm him down.

"You're hurt. Let me take you to the hospital."

Irvin pressed his lips together and nodded.

Unexpectedly, Stanley followed them to the same hospital.

While Irvin was getting checked out, Kaitlyn called Christina.

"Christina, I'm at the hospital. Can you come over? I need your help."

The situation was too much for her to handle alone.

Christina, hearing Kaitlyn was at the hospital, got worried.

"Are you okay? Is it serious?"

"It's not me, Christina. Just come quickly." Kaitlyn sighed, glancing at Stanley watching her from a distance.

Christina, sensing the urgency in Kaitlyn's voice, didn't ask more questions. She got the hospital's address and hung up, heading over immediately.

After hanging up, Kaitlyn felt a sharp pain in her abdomen.

She brushed it off and went back to the examination room.

The doctor was discussing Irvin's condition.

"Your injuries are pretty bad, and with the dizziness, we can't rule out a concussion. You should stay for observation for a day."

Irvin, not wanting the hassle, was about to refuse when Kaitlyn agreed for him.

"Alright, let's do that. We can't take any chances."

Seeing her agree, Irvin didn't argue and nodded, "Okay, I'll stay for a day."

Stanley, also badly injured, was getting checked out when Christina arrived.

Kaitlyn met her outside and quickly explained the situation.

Christina was incredulous, "I can't believe he's regretting now."

"Probably just broke," Kaitlyn scoffed, "I don't want to deal with him. You know him, try to talk some sense into him."

Christina took a deep breath and smiled wryly.

"Alright."

Stanley was surprised to see Christina.

She sat next to him and handed him a bottle of water.

"Want to talk?"

Stanley, feeling lost over the years, found a moment of clarity seeing her, remembering his dream of being an architect. But he had strayed far from that path.

Stanley's voice was subdued, "Is there anything left to talk about?"

"We were colleagues once, and you were my mentor," Christina said, glancing at him. "Kaitlyn asked me to come."

Stanley gritted his teeth. "What did she want you to say?"

Christina smiled faintly. "She didn't say much, just that she doesn't know how to resolve this, but she's certain she doesn't want any more ties with you."

Stanley's lips trembled. "She's really done with me!"

"Don't be fooled by my calm demeanor. I also want to punch you," Christina was blunt. "When she had a miscarriage, she called you multiple times, and you never answered. I was the one who stayed with her. If she wasn't done with you, how could she bear it?"

Stanley was speechless, rubbing his head furiously. He didn't know if he felt more guilt or if he wanted to use her feelings more.

Christina stayed with him until his check-up was done. His finger was slightly fractured, and he had it splinted, waiting for it to heal.

"I drove here. Let me take you home."

"I want to see Kaitlyn one more time," Stanley took a deep breath, "to apologize. I promise I won't say anything else."

Hearing this, Christina reluctantly agreed. "Alright."

Kaitlyn was accompanying Irvin to his room. Her abdominal pain worsened, causing her to break out in a cold sweat. Irvin noticed immediately and asked urgently, "Are you okay?"

Kaitlyn shook her head, trying to stand up, but the pain intensified. She couldn't help but kneel on the floor.

Stanley saw this from afar and rushed over. "Kaitlyn, are you alright?"

Kaitlyn waved her hand but couldn't utter a word. Stanley tried to lift her to take her to the ER, but his fractured finger made it difficult. He failed on his first attempt.

Irvin quickly understood and picked Kaitlyn up. Christina ran ahead to call the doctor.

Irvin carried Kaitlyn, rushing towards the ER. Her face was pale, beads of sweat forming on her forehead, her body curled up in his arms, looking incredibly fragile.

"Doctor! Doctor!" Christina's voice echoed down the hallway. Soon, several medical staff arrived with a stretcher.

Irvin carefully placed Kaitlyn on the stretcher, softly reassuring her, "Don't worry, the doctors are here. You'll be okay."

Kaitlyn barely opened her eyes, glanced at him, her lips moved as if to speak, but no words came out.

The medical staff quickly wheeled her into the ER, the red light outside the door turning on, heightening the tension.

Irvin stood outside, his fists clenched tightly, knuckles white from the pressure. His face still bore dried blood and bruises, but he was entirely focused on Kaitlyn's well-being.

Stanley stood a short distance away, his gaze fixed on the ER door, filled with complex emotions.

Christina patted his shoulder, speaking softly, "Let's wait. The doctors will take care of her."

###chapter 280 Why Haven't You Left Yet?

Time seemed to crawl by, the hallway so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

Finally, the emergency room door swung open, and a doctor stepped out.

"Who's here for the patient?" the doctor asked.

Irvin and Stanley both stepped forward at the same time, saying in unison, "I am!"

The doctor glanced at them, frowned slightly, and continued, "The patient has acute appendicitis and needs immediate surgery. Who's signing the consent form?"

Without missing a beat, Irvin said, "I'll sign."

Stanley opened his mouth as if to say something but then closed it, staying silent.

After a few more hours of waiting, Kaitlyn was wheeled out.

The doctor removed his mask and began explaining the situation to them.

"The anesthesia hasn't worn off yet, and given her medical history, she's pretty weak. She needs to rest and fully recover before doing anything strenuous."

"Got it!" Christina nodded, feeling a bit relieved deep down.

Thank goodness, it was just acute appendicitis.

Over two hours later, Kaitlyn finally woke up, seeing Irvin and Christina by her side.

She tried to sit up, but Irvin immediately pressed her back down onto the bed.

"You just had surgery, don't move around."

"Surgery? What happened to me?" Kaitlyn touched her stomach.

"Acute appendicitis," Irvin said seriously.

"Oh, I see." Kaitlyn smiled weakly. "I've always been a bit of a sickly person, had all sorts of illnesses."

Irvin looked at her gently. "Then you need to eat more and get stronger."

Kaitlyn smiled but didn't say anything.

Stanley suddenly spoke up.

"Kaitlyn, you need to get better soon."

Hearing his voice, Kaitlyn's smile froze.

"Why are you still here?"

Christina tried to smooth things over. "He's just here to apologize, nothing more."

This was also a reminder to Stanley.

Kaitlyn was sick now, so he shouldn't say anything inappropriate.

Stanley coughed. "Yes, I'm here to apologize."

"I've received your apology. You can go now." Kaitlyn waved her hand, not even wanting to look at him.

Christina walked to the door. "I'll see you out."

At this point, Stanley had no choice but to leave. He nodded reluctantly.

As they were about to leave the hospital, he looked at Christina earnestly. "Can you put in a good word for me with Kaitlyn?"

Christina smiled faintly. "I've said all I can. It's up to her now. I won't interfere in other people's matters."

Stanley suddenly blurted out, "Have you been bought off by Irvin too?"

"Don't be so extreme, okay?" Christina frowned. "It's Kaitlyn's decision to make."

"Sorry." Stanley took a deep breath and walked away.

When Christina returned, she briefly explained the situation.

Kaitlyn, lying in bed, sighed. "So annoying."

Irvin handed her a cup of warm water, half-jokingly saying, "Marry me, and he won't have anything to say."

Kaitlyn stiffened, feeling shy, and glanced at Christina.

"Christina's still here!"

Christina immediately raised her hand. "I didn't hear anything. You two carry on."

Irvin smiled and held her hand. "Kaitlyn, I don't know what you're worried about, but I'll take good care of you."

Kaitlyn mustered the courage to ask something but lost confidence and burrowed under the covers.

"I just had surgery. I want to rest."

Christina stayed with her until late before leaving. The next day, when she returned to the hospital, she found Irvin already there with lots of food.

"Kaitlyn, my mom made some porridge. It's really good. Want to try some?"

Kaitlyn sat up. "Your mom's cooking must be great. You didn't tell her I was sick, did you?"

"When I got home, she asked casually, and I just mentioned it." Irvin brought the porridge to her mouth.

Kaitlyn looked at his face, still not fully healed.

"Did she ask how you got hurt?"

Irvin nodded. "She did."

Kaitlyn's heart skipped a beat.

Irvin laughed. "Don't worry, I didn't tell on you. I said I was being a hero and chased off a robber."

Kaitlyn felt relieved.

"Good, I thought you couldn't lie."

Irvin chuckled. "What gave you that impression?"

"You just seem like a very upright person." Kaitlyn shrugged.

"Really?" Irvin suddenly leaned in, their eyes just inches apart. "I can be not so upright too."

Kaitlyn panicked and glanced at the door, seeing Christina standing there. "Christina, you're here? Why didn't you say anything?"

Christina, seeing their affectionate moment, had planned to leave quietly but was caught. She walked in awkwardly.

"Sorry to interrupt."

"No problem, you're not interrupting." Kaitlyn cleared her throat. "Christina, did you bring me something good to eat too?"

Irvin, feeling a bit awkward, scratched his nose. He didn't understand why Kaitlyn always seemed so evasive when this topic came up.

But with Christina there, he didn't want to ask.

Christina smiled, placing a thermos on the bedside table, her eyes shifting between them.

"Yes, I heard you just had surgery, so I made some fresh fruit juice and a bowl of steamed eggs, light and easy on the stomach."

Kaitlyn's eyes lit up. "Thank you, Christina. You're so thoughtful."

Irvin stepped back, giving Kaitlyn some space.

He smiled. "With so many people caring for you, you have to get better soon."

Kaitlyn pouted, picking up the steamed eggs and porridge, eating slowly.

Irvin poured some water.

Christina watched them, a smile on her face. "Looks like you have company. I'll leave now."

She gave Irvin a meaningful look and turned to leave.

Kaitlyn glanced at Irvin and quickly called out, "Christina, don't go. Stay and chat with me."

Christina stopped, smiling back. "You two chat. I won't intrude. Besides, I have to pick up my kids. I'll visit another day."

She nodded to Irvin and quickly left the room.

###chapter 281 Three Years Without Seeing

She never thought she'd run into someone she knew at the hospital.

It was Walter, someone she hadn't seen in three years.

"Hey, Walter," Christina said, surprised.

She knew all about Walter and Rhea, including the things Walter had done to her in the past. But he had also helped her.

When it came to harm, William was the one who was truly unforgivable. Walter had only intended to catch a glimpse of Christina from afar, but she noticed him.

Seeing the joy on Christina's face, Walter was a bit taken aback. "Christina, you don't hate me?"

He had almost caused her harm.

Christina smiled. "I get why you did those things. But you also helped me."

In the Cavendish family, he had been kind to her and had helped her. One shouldn't abandon their family because of a momentary mistake. In her heart, she always considered Walter as her brother.

Hearing Christina say this, Walter felt a deep sense of shame. "Christina, I'm really sorry. You don't blame me, yet I did those things that hurt you. I was really awful."

"That's all in the past. I haven't seen you in three years. How have you been?"

Walter's eyes stung, but he held back his emotions and smiled, nodding. "I've been good. How about you?"

After William found out about the things he and Rhea had done together, he personally sent Walter abroad. He had been abroad for three years, constantly restricted. Most importantly, he had been obsessively thinking about Christina. He had just returned a couple of days ago.

Christina nodded. "I've been good too. Let's have dinner sometime. I have some things to take care of."

She was working on a project with Atlas. Atlas had promptly sent out the project proposal and ensured Mia had a stable position in the company. However, there were still some details that she was responsible for. She had planned to finish the project early, but then Kaitlyn had another incident. Honestly, she hoped Kaitlyn would get away from bad men soon.

"Seeing how different you are now, I'm really happy for you. Christina, I hope you're doing well. If you don't choose to be with William, can I be your daughter's father?"

Walter pursed his lips and took a deep breath. He looked at Christina with hope. Before her child was born, Walter had said he was willing to accept her child. Now, with Walter saying this, it was clear he knew everything about her. He had been watching from the shadows, and Christina realized that this encounter with Walter was no coincidence.

"Walter, you deserve someone better. Let the past be the past. I don't want to dwell on it. I only want to focus on the future," Christina said slowly.

She had little hope for marriage or relationships. Her only belief now was Harper. She wanted to take good care of her daughter and make up for the regrets of her past life. Although this daughter looked somewhat similar to the Harper from her past life, she was not Harper. If the Harper from her past life hadn't died, how wonderful it would be.

Despite taking so many contraceptives, she still ended up pregnant, still had William's child, and was still entangled with William.

But she was certain of one thing: she wouldn't let this Harper suffer the same tragic fate as the Harper from her past life.

"I get it," Walter nodded.

He knew Christina's stance, but he wasn't ready to give up. As long as Christina didn't accept William and didn't live a happy family life with him, Walter still had a chance.

Christina walked away.

Not long after, a sleek black Maybach pulled up in front of her. She knew exactly whose car it was.

She didn't want to engage, but William stepped out of the car.

"Do you have to be so cold when you see me? Are we really going to ignore each other for the rest of our lives?" William grabbed Christina's arm.

Christina didn't like his demanding tone. "Is there any reason for us to interact? I've made things clear to you, but you still act like you don't get it. What more can I do?"

She felt helpless. Every time she tried to avoid William, he found a way back into her life.

In front of her daughter, she had to be a good-tempered mom and couldn't get angry at William. But Harper wasn't here now. She didn't want to tolerate William at all.

William pursed his lips and spoke softly, "We've been through so much together, things that no one else can understand. Our daughter is back with us now. Without anyone else's interference, we should enjoy the present. I can take care of you both and won't let you be hurt. Christina, please don't be stubborn anymore."

Hearing William ask her not to be stubborn, Christina found it laughable.

If William hadn't remembered their past life, she might have forgiven him for not knowing. But William remembered everything. He knew how tragically she and their daughter had died in the past.

Knowing all this, he still said these things to her. It was unbelievable!

Christina raised her hand and slapped William hard.

"William, even killing you wouldn't be enough to vent my anger. Harper died so painfully, she didn't even have a complete body, and what were you doing? You were with Jennifer, with your son!"

Even if William and Jennifer hadn't had a physical relationship in this life, it didn't matter. At the beginning, William had unconditionally favored Jennifer.

In the past life, William had hurt her both mentally and physically. Why should she forgive him?

William didn't get angry, nor did he retaliate.

Bob, in the driver's seat, saw this and pursed his lips, sighing inwardly.

William had been chasing Christina for three years. When he thought Christina was dead, he became a shell of a man. When he finally saw Christina return, with their daughter, he felt alive again. But Christina's attitude was even stronger than before.

William's path to winning her back was going to be long!

William didn't get angry. He blocked Christina's way, "Harper's birthday is coming up. Christina, can I attend?"

Christina frowned, "You came to find me just for this?"

"Not entirely. I also wanted to see you."

William was straightforward.

But Christina wasn't a naive teenager. She wouldn't be moved by a few words from William.

She coldly replied, "How you attend or prepare is your business, not mine."

Harper liked him too. She couldn't interfere with the father-daughter relationship.

Right now, her priority was work.

With that, Christina left William behind.

###chapter 282: Daughter's Birthday

William watched Christina walk away, his heart aching, but he held back. He knew he had brought this upon himself and didn't blame her.

But he wasn't going to give up on her and their daughter.

Seven days later, it was Harper's birthday.

Christina got up early and dressed her daughter Harper beautifully, like a little princess.

Harper wore a pink dress and a small princess crown on her head. Christina had styled her hair herself, making Harper look adorable from head to toe.

"Our Harper looks so pretty today," Christina said, giving Harper a kiss. Harper snuggled into her mother's arms, her big eyes blinking.

"Mom, when is Dad Cavendish coming to my birthday party?" Harper asked.

Christina's smile faltered for a moment at Harper's question, but seeing the hopeful look on her daughter's face, she gently patted Harper's hair. "Dad Cavendish should be here soon. Do you want to see him?"

"Of course!" Harper nodded enthusiastically. "Dad Cavendish is so good to me. He'll definitely come to my birthday party!"

Christina couldn't help but laugh at Harper's grown-up demeanor. "Alright," she said, holding Harper's hand and gently tapping her nose. "Be a good girl, and Dad Cavendish will be here soon."

Harper cheered and hugged Christina, giving her several kisses. "Great! I can't wait to see Dad Cavendish!"

Harper's big, lively eyes sparkled with excitement, and it wasn't long before William arrived as expected.

"Dad Cavendish, you're here!" Harper ran to him, wrapping her small arms around his and swaying with joy.

"Harper is three years old today. What gift did you bring me, Dad Cavendish?" Harper asked, looking at William with eyes full of anticipation, glancing at the gift box in his hand.

"You!" William chuckled at Harper's cuteness and handed her the gift he had prepared. "Of course, Dad Cavendish brought a gift for such an important day. Open it and see if you like it."

Harper eagerly nodded, holding the gift box tightly, reluctant to open it. Curiosity eventually won, and when she saw the toys inside, she jumped with joy.

"Dad Cavendish, how did you know I love toys the most? And it's a whole set! This is my favorite!" Harper hugged one of the toys, unable to let go.

"Because Dad Cavendish has magic," William said with a smile, glancing at Christina. "Christina, I'd like to spend some time with Harper."

Christina gave him a brief look and, seeing Harper's happiness, reluctantly agreed. "Since Harper likes you, you can stay for a while."

William sighed in relief, though he still felt a bit down about Christina's cold attitude. But she had allowed him to stay, and he wasn't going to waste the opportunity. He sat on the floor with Harper, playing house with her.

Harper loved the gift, and William decided to spend more time with her. He believed that if Harper liked him, he could eventually win Christina's heart again.

"Dad Cavendish, can we play house where you're my dad?" Harper asked, glancing at Christina, who didn't object. Harper sighed in relief, thinking her mom might get mad. She knew William was her dad, but her mom didn't seem to accept him, so she pretended not to know. But her dad was so good to her.

If her parents could reconcile, that would be the best.

Harper's eyes sparkled with a new idea. "Okay, Dad Cavendish, let's play house. You be my dad first!"

Harper's innocent smile made her look like she didn't understand anything. Christina sighed. Harper was rarely this lively and liked William so much. They were father and daughter, after all, and blood ties couldn't be denied.

Christina accepted it, and William smiled. "Alright, I'll be Harper's dad first."

They played until Harper got tired. William noticed Christina sitting at the table, busy with her computer. He looked at Harper and tentatively suggested, "Harper, it's your birthday. How about Dad Cavendish takes you to see fireworks?"

Harper jumped with joy at the mention of fireworks. "Yes, yes! I love fireworks!"

Harper hugged William's arm, and William nervously looked at Christina, afraid she would refuse. "Christina, Harper wants to see fireworks. Can we..."

Before he could finish, Christina was about to refuse. But Harper, sensing her mom's thoughts, let go of William and pleaded with Christina, pouting. "Mom, it's my birthday. I really want to see fireworks. Please let Dad Cavendish take me, and you come too."

Christina couldn't refuse Harper's innocent, pleading eyes. They were father and daughter, and Harper longed for her dad's love. She shouldn't keep them apart.

Christina sighed and nodded. "It's your birthday, so I'll agree this time. But you must behave and not run off, okay?"

Harper nodded eagerly, almost jumping with joy. "Don't worry, Mom. I'll be good!"

Harper's quick agreement made William sigh in relief. Without Harper, he wouldn't have been able to get Christina to go out.

Thinking about his plan, William felt nervous but kept a calm demeanor, smiling at Christina. "Since Harper wants to see fireworks, Christina, why don't you come too? It'll be a nice outing for Harper."

Christina didn't want to engage with William, but with Harper there, she reluctantly agreed. "Alright, let's go out for a bit."

###chapter 283 Daughter's Affection

William had gotten used to Christina's icy attitude a long time ago. Just getting her to come out today was enough to make him happy.

So, he chose to ignore Christina's frosty expression and instead gave her a gentle smile.

"Alright, it's still morning. How about we take Harper to the amusement park first, grab some lunch, and then follow Harper's plans for the afternoon? In the evening, we can watch the fireworks together."

Before Christina could respond, Harper jumped up excitedly and shouted, "Yay!"

"Yes, yes! Harper loves Dad Cavendish's plan!"

Of course, her dad knew exactly what she liked and had planned the day perfectly!

Christina looked at her daughter's joyful face and sighed, rubbing her forehead in resignation.

There was no helping it. Harper adored her dad, and even though she didn't know William's true identity, she still had so much fun with him.

Christina was often busy with work and didn't spend as much time with Harper as she would have liked.

Today, Harper was happy, and Christina didn't want to spoil her daughter's fun.

So, Christina gently stroked Harper's hair. "Of course, but Harper, don't be too much trouble for Dad Cavendish, okay? Be a good girl."

Seeing her mom finally not giving her dad the cold shoulder, Harper was overjoyed and quickly nodded.

"Don't worry, Mom. Harper will be good!"

Harper, like a little adult, tried her best to keep the atmosphere lively.

Christina could sense that her daughter might have picked up on her dislike for William, which was why she was trying so hard to make her happy.

Christina exhaled slowly, pushing down the guilt she felt, and decided not to keep up her cold demeanor.

After all, it was her daughter's birthday, and Harper's happiness was the most important thing.

So, William carried Harper all the way, with Christina walking beside them.

William and Christina were both very attractive, and Harper, who had inherited the best features from both of them, looked like a perfect blend of the two. They looked like a picture-perfect family, drawing many admiring glances.

At the amusement park, Harper ran around excitedly.

Whenever she found something she wanted to play with, she would drag William and Christina along, insisting they join her.

Christina, though a bit helpless, did her best to go along with all of her daughter's requests.

As evening approached, Harper started to get tired from all the playing.

William then suggested they go to the rooftop revolving restaurant for dinner.

The atmosphere was warm and cozy, and there were toys nearby that Harper loved to play with.

Harper was all smiles.

Having both her mom and dad with her all day for her birthday made her very happy!

"Dad Cavendish, where are my fireworks?"

Suddenly remembering something, Harper looked at William with a serious expression.

Her earnest look made William chuckle.

"Harper, don't worry. Close your eyes and count down from three. When you open your eyes, you'll see what you want."

"Really?"

Harper blinked skeptically but, seeing William nod seriously, she hesitantly closed her eyes.

"Three, two, one!"

Harper counted down and, guided by William, opened her eyes.

"Boom!"

The large floor-to-ceiling window lit up instantly as brilliant fireworks exploded outside.

"Wow, it's real! So beautiful!"

Harper was so excited she almost jumped up, grabbing William's arm and giving him a kiss on the cheek.

"Dad Cavendish, you must know magic! It's amazing!"

Harper danced around happily, while the dazzling fireworks lit up the entire revolving restaurant.

William's gaze instinctively fell on Christina.

Christina, momentarily lost in the beauty of the fireworks, suddenly felt William's eyes on her and looked over, meeting his tender and affectionate gaze.

"Christina."

William walked towards her seriously and suddenly knelt on one knee.

"I know I messed up before. No matter how much I apologize, I can't make up for the hurt I caused you."

"So, I'm willing to spend the rest of my life making it up to you and Harper, ensuring you never suffer again."

As he spoke, William grew nervous, like a boy confessing his love for the first time, even breaking out in a sweat.

Guessing what William was about to say, Christina instinctively took a step back, feeling a sharp pain in her heart.

This William had helped her countless times when she was in need, always extending a helping hand.

But he was also the one who had hurt her deeply, leaving her scarred and unwilling to believe in love again.

And now, William wanted to propose to her.

With an incredulous look on her face, Christina was about to speak.

But William hurriedly interrupted her, afraid of hearing something he didn't want to.

"Christina, will you marry me?"

"I want to love and cherish you again, never letting you suffer. If you don't believe me, I can give you and Harper all my assets, just to make you feel secure."

The expected proposal came, but Christina bit her lip, suppressing the pain in her heart, and decisively shook her head.

"No, I don't want to."

Christina looked at Harper, who was still cheering at the fireworks, and said softly, "Whether in the past or the future, I don't want to have too much to do with you."

The expected answer still couldn't mask the pain in William's heart, and he smiled bitterly.

"I knew you would refuse, but I still wanted to hear it from you."

"Now that you've heard it, stop having unrealistic fantasies."

With that, Christina turned away from him and walked over to Harper, joining her in watching the fireworks.

Though she refused the proposal, she wouldn't deny William's contact with their daughter.

Since Harper liked William, there was no need to deprive her of the little fatherly love she had.

This was something William owed to both of them.

As the night deepened, William carried a sleeping Harper out of the revolving restaurant.

Christina stood silently beside him.

They waited in the lobby until William's assistant brought the car around.

"Mr. Cavendish."

The assistant handed William the keys and left.

William turned, still holding the small, sleeping Harper, and looked intently at Christina.

###chapter 284 Pursuer

"Hey Christina, need a ride home?"

Christina glanced at William, her face still indifferent, and shook her head.

"No, I'm good."

Realizing her tone might've been a bit harsh, she added, "Thanks for spending Harper's birthday with us. I can call a cab and head home with Harper."

"It's pretty late. It's not safe for you and Harper to take a cab. Let me drive you home."

Christina's refusal made William smile wryly. "Don't worry, I just want to make sure you get home safe. I won't do anything weird."

Considering it might be tough to find a cab here, Christina decided not to be stubborn and nodded in agreement.

William finally breathed a sigh of relief and, in a gentlemanly manner, handed Harper over to Christina.

Once they were both settled in the car, he drove them home.

This time, William didn't say much. He sat in the car, watching the mother and daughter enter their home. The lights went on and off, but he still didn't leave.

The night was deep, and William looked at the distant room, his eyes revealing a hint of sadness.

How could he win back Christina's heart?

Days passed uneventfully. William no longer clung to Christina as he used to, but he would occasionally use work as an excuse to make his presence known to her.

With Harper's fondness for him, Christina found it hard to refuse. Besides, William hadn't done anything inappropriate, so she allowed him to be close to Harper.

"Ms. Windsor, today's collaboration went smoothly. How about lunch?"

After finishing a collaboration with Henry Lewis, the only son of the Lewis Family, Christina looked at Henry, who had invited her, and smiled politely but distantly.

"Thanks for the invite, Mr. Lewis, but I have other matters to attend to today, so I can't."

Henry's smile faltered slightly. Despite Christina's refusal, he didn't give up. He stepped forward, blocking her path.

"What are you doing, Mr. Lewis?"

Christina's smile faded, but she held back harsh words, considering he was a future collaborator. "If you have any questions about the collaboration, you can talk to my assistant. I have work to do and can't spare the time."

"If you can't spare the time, then make time."

Henry's smile was insincere. Looking at Christina's indifferent face, he felt a strong desire.

Everyone said Christina was beautiful. Since collaborating with her, Henry had wanted to conquer this unattainable flower.

So, being rejected by Christina didn't anger him. Instead, he flashed what he thought was a charming smile.

Just as he was about to speak, a cold voice came from behind Christina.

"Didn't you hear her say she's not interested?"

Hearing the cold voice, Christina felt a ripple in her heart, even though she had decided not to have any more interactions with William.

"Mr. Cavendish?"

Seeing William, Henry's smile froze instantly.

Everyone said William wasn't interested in women, but he had a wife he cared deeply about.

Yet today, he openly defended Christina.

Henry quickly understood, his forehead sweating, but he didn't dare wipe it. His face was full of forced smiles.

He didn't know the history between William and Christina, but he had heard bits and pieces from his elders, so he pieced the story together himself.

"So, Ms. Windsor is your... uh, kept woman. I didn't recognize her and almost offended her. Mr. Cavendish, please don't hold it against me."

"What kept woman?"

William coldly interrupted Henry. "Ms. Windsor is not a mistress or a kept woman. Don't impose your assumptions on others."

"If Ms. Windsor doesn't want to, don't pester her."

Henry didn't dare say anything else, nodding repeatedly.

"Get lost. If you bother Ms. Windsor again, I won't hesitate to make the Lewis Family lose some important projects!"

With just a few words, Henry didn't dare say anything more. He quickly wiped his forehead and left in a hurry.

After Henry left, William walked up to Christina.

Christina looked at William calmly, but her heart wasn't as serene.

"Mr. Cavendish, thank you."

Her distant words pained William, but he didn't show it. Instead, he smiled gently.

"I happened to be passing by. I didn't expect the Lewis Family to be so presumptuous. It was just a small favor. Don't feel burdened."

Christina nodded.

He had helped her, so there was no need to treat William like a snake.

She had decided not to have much interaction with William, so this distant relationship was fine.

However, William said he was passing by, which Christina didn't believe.

But she didn't expose his lie. Instead, she casually asked, "Do you have any other business?"

"Can't I stay if I don't have any business?"

William smiled, worried that Christina might be upset by his words, and quickly added, "Of course, since I ran into you, I wanted to tell you something."

He had been waiting nearby for a long time, hoping to see Christina leave the office building.

But when he saw her, he didn't dare get out of the car, afraid of offending her and making her dislike him more.

Apart from meeting Harper, he couldn't find any other excuse to appear in front of Christina.

"What is it?" Christina asked.

"It's nothing major. Our company, Cavendish Corporation, has a design collaboration with your firm. The contract was signed this morning, and you'll be working with me directly."

He handed the contract to Christina, carefully observing her expression.

"What design contract?"

Christina took the contract. Seeing the contents, her smile faded a bit.

"So, I have to go on a business trip to Drakoria with you the day after tomorrow?"

The contract clearly stated that she, as William's partner, needed to go to Drakoria with him to negotiate with a renowned design team.

But...

Christina frowned. Why hadn't her boss mentioned this to her?

###chapter 285: Going on a Business Trip Together

Seeing the confusion on Christina's face, William knew she didn't believe him.

He wasn't upset. Instead, he took the initiative to explain, "Your boss just finalized the deal with me. This afternoon, you were out negotiating with the Lewis Corporation, so it's normal you haven't heard the news yet."

"You'll probably hear about it tomorrow morning, but I'm giving you a heads-up so you can start packing. The sooner we leave, the sooner we can wrap up the deal."

William paused and gave a bitter smile, "You won't have to see me every day and have me be a bother."

He knew that if it weren't for his personal motives and using his position, he wouldn't have become Christina's client.

Christina would never have accompanied him abroad in her lifetime.

Hearing William's words, Christina remained silent.

William had just become her client, and now she had to travel with him to Drakoria for business.

If this collaboration was just a coincidence, Christina would never believe it.

She wasn't a child anymore. The Cavendish Corporation collaborating with her company was definitely due to William's direct influence. Such a high-level collaboration wouldn't have happened otherwise.

But since the collaboration was already set, and the payment was substantial, if it went smoothly, Christina could earn nearly a million dollars.

No one would turn down money, and Christina was no exception.

It was just a business trip. Even if William had other intentions and wanted to use this opportunity to get closer to her, Christina wouldn't agree.

Having made up her mind, Christina looked at William, who was clearly anxious, and nodded lightly.

"What time is the flight the day after tomorrow?"

William didn't expect Christina to accept so easily. He suppressed his joy and quickly said, "I've already had my assistant book the tickets. It's roughly the afternoon the day after tomorrow, but the exact time isn't confirmed yet."

"If you don't mind, I'll have my assistant pick you up from the office. Just have your luggage ready by tomorrow night, and my assistant will handle the rest."

William originally wanted to say he would handle it, but feared Christina would reject him, so he chose to compromise.

The sudden business trip only gave Christina a day to prepare.

She still needed to arrange care for Harper during the trip.

After thinking it over, Christina didn't reject William's arrangement and nodded.

"As for Harper..."

Seeing the concern in Christina's eyes, William volunteered, "If you don't mind, I can arrange care for Harper while we're away."

Harper liked his personal assistant, so having the assistant look after Harper during the trip would put him at ease.

After all, William was Harper's biological father, and he had become more reliable in this lifetime. Christina had seen his dedication to Harper.

The trip was only for a month, and they would be back soon.

Thinking of this, Christina nodded, "Alright, thank you."

She remained polite and distant towards William, which made him feel bittersweet, but he still smiled warmly.

"Alright, I'll get everything sorted right away."

The collaboration was set in stone, just as William had said. Early the next morning, Christina received a call from her boss, telling her to prepare for the trip.

Having heard from William in advance, Christina had already packed her luggage.

She wasn't new to business trips, so packing was quick and efficient. William had also arranged everything for Harper.

Knowing her mom was going on a trip, Harper didn't cling to Christina, as it wasn't the first time they were apart.

Upon learning that her mom was traveling with her dad, Harper was overjoyed.

If her dad could win her mom's forgiveness and they could be together, it would be a dream come true!

The next afternoon, Christina was picked up by William's assistant.

The car drove straight to the airport.

William had been waiting there, eagerly looking towards the entrance.

He wanted to pick Christina up himself but feared she would resist, so he held back.

Now that Christina had arrived smoothly, William breathed a sigh of relief, feeling a weight lifted off his shoulders.

Drakoria.

After arriving at Drakoria airport, they were quickly picked up by the local design team and taken to a farm on the outskirts.

The design collaboration was inspired by the farm, and the Drakoria team had arranged for William and Christina to stay there.

The farm was full of local charm, with plenty of farmland ahead.

Many residents lived nearby, giving it a unique village feel.

Christina settled her luggage and breathed in the fresh air of the farm, closing her eyes slightly.

After sitting on the plane for so long, she was exhausted.

But the scenery was so beautiful that she couldn't help but look out the window for a while.

Just then, there was a knock on the door.

Christina went to open it and saw William standing there.

She frowned and instinctively tried to close the door.

William quickly extended his right hand, showing the tray in his palm to Christina.

The door almost caught William's hand, but Christina quickly stopped, frowning at him.

If she had been a bit slower, William's hand would have been caught, with dire consequences.

"Sorry."

William smiled, his eyes fixed on Christina.

"I know you like tiramisu. The farm owner made it specially and asked me to bring it to you."

Looking at the small cake on the tray, Christina pursed her lips.

She wanted to say that she might not like what she used to anymore.

But the cake was a kind gesture from the farm owner, and Christina didn't want to waste it, so she took it.

"Thanks. You can go now."

Christina didn't want any unnecessary interaction with William outside of work.

However, William wasn't discouraged. Despite Christina's cold demeanor, he still smiled.

"Christina, I can't find my copy of the contract. Could you help me find yours so I can review it and prepare a plan? I don't want to be caught off guard when we meet with the Drakoria design team."

###chapter 286 Unexpected

Christina frowned, but William was dead set on staying, using work as an excuse, which left her with no way to refuse.

"Fine, come in then."

With no other choice, Christina stepped aside, letting William enter. She turned away, not wanting to look at him, and bent down to open her suitcase, searching for the documents.

Christina's room was on the first floor, and the sunlight streaming through the window lit up her pale face. Her long eyelashes cast shadows, making it hard to read her emotions.

William was entranced, only snapping out of it when Christina shoved the contract into his hand.

"Here's the contract. Can you leave now?"

Her voice was cold and emotionless. William tightened his grip on the contract, wanting to find another excuse to stay, but the ground suddenly shook!

The ceiling beams began to collapse, and Christina nearly fell.

"Watch out!"

William quickly pulled Christina into his arms, moving them to the side just in time to avoid a falling beam.

The shaking intensified, and they quickly realized it was an earthquake. The ground shook violently, and debris rained down.

Christina had no choice but to let William protect her, her heart pounding.

"William..."

She wanted to suggest they escape, but William's steady voice interrupted her.

"Don't be scared. I'm here. I won't let you get hurt."

William scanned the room and quickly chose a spot. He led Christina to a corner, a relatively safer spot despite the danger.

"Cough, cough..."

The dust from the earthquake made Christina cough violently. William, still holding her, grabbed a bottle of water from the corner and tore a piece of his shirt, wetting it.

"Cover your mouth and nose. Save your strength. We'll figure out how to get help once it calms down."

They hadn't expected an earthquake right after arriving. Christina struggled to cover her mouth and nose with the damp cloth. When the shaking subsided, she noticed William's left leg was pinned by a beam, and he was covered in injuries.

Even his face had scratches. In contrast, Christina had only a few scrapes on her arm, thanks to William's protection.

"William, are you okay?"

Seeing his severe injuries, Christina's heart tightened. She didn't realize she was gripping his hand, her body trembling.

"Don't worry. I'm still here with you."

William forced a smile, wincing as it pulled at a cut on his lip.

"You're not okay!"

Christina's eyes filled with tears. "You risked your life to protect me!"

She looked at the beam pinning his legs and around the room. After several aftershocks, the ground was still.

Christina bit her lip and tried to move the beam, but it was too heavy.

"Don't waste your strength. Rest for now. We need to conserve our energy."

Seeing her red eyes, William smiled and handed her the remaining half bottle of water.

"Drink some water. We're in a village. Help will come."

Water was crucial after an earthquake. The half bottle they had could save their lives, but William gave it to her without hesitation.

Christina bit her lip and pushed the bottle back to him.

"No, you drink first."

Reluctantly, William took a sip, then watched until Christina did the same before relaxing.

"Help! Is anyone there?"

After resting, Christina called out, but only silence answered.

Her phone was on the bed, just out of reach, blocked by debris. They were trapped, and William's legs were pinned. If they stayed like this, he might lose his legs.

Christina was desperate, trying to move the beam every few minutes. Fortunately, there was some space between the beam and William's legs, preventing further damage.

Looking at the injured William, she saw how exhausted he was, his eyes drooping.

"William, stay awake! Let's talk. You wanted to spend time with Harper, right? If we get out of this, I'll let you take Harper out."

William struggled to open his eyes, smiling weakly at the blurry Christina.

"Okay..."

"You wanted to see me more often, right? If you survive, I'll let you see me twice a week, no, three times!"

Christina wiped her tears, her heart aching. William had saved her repeatedly, protecting her during the earthquake, but he was severely injured.

If he passed out, he might never wake up.

She resented him for their daughter's sake, but she couldn't accept him. In her past life, her daughter never got to see William before she died.

No matter his reasons, Christina could coexist with him now but would never accept him again.

"Is anyone there? Help!"

Seeing William about to close his eyes, Christina screamed in desperation.

###chapter 287: William, You Can't Die!

No matter what, in this lifetime, William had saved her countless times from danger.

Putting aside all other grievances, if it weren't for William saving her this time, she would have been buried under the rubble long ago.

So, Christina absolutely couldn't just watch William die in front of her!

The sky was getting darker, and William felt increasingly drowsy, his eyelids heavy as if weighed down by stones, making it impossible to open them.

But he still remembered tightly holding Christina's hand, mouthing something silently.

Christina couldn't understand, so she leaned her ear close to William's lips, tears welling up as she finally heard the few words he managed to say.

"Take care... of yourself..."

With great difficulty, William finished the sentence, and then he could no longer keep his eyes open, gradually losing consciousness.

"William, wake up!"

Christina's eyes widened, but no matter how she called out to William, he remained tightly shut-eyed, showing no signs of waking up.

The sky was getting darker, and Christina, who had always been afraid of the dark, felt her heart race with panic as William lay unconscious beside her.

The countryside manor was extremely cold at night, and being in a sparsely populated area, finding rescue seemed unlikely.

There were no thick clothes around to keep them warm, and if this continued, they would both die from hypothermia.

Looking at the disheveled William in front of her, Christina gritted her teeth, took off her heavy coat, and covered him with it.

"William, you can't die!"

Christina's voice was choked with sobs as she warned, "If you die, you'll owe me in this life and the next, and you'll have to repay me in the next life!"

"I know we can't be together, but if you die because of me, I won't allow you to leave me with such guilt!"

She wiped away her tears, rambling on about their past lives and present, afraid that if she stopped talking, her mind would wander.

The temperature kept dropping, and Christina was shivering from the cold, but she didn't take the down jacket off William, wrapping him tightly instead.

"Even if you die, stay away from me. Don't die because of me, do you hear?"

"So wake up now, or I'll leave right now!"

As she spoke, Christina pretended to leave, but suddenly, voices came from above the rubble, followed by the light of a flashlight.

"Is anyone there?"

Seeing this, Christina quickly shouted, afraid that if she delayed even a second, the rescuers would disappear and miss them.

Fortunately, Christina's voice was loud enough, and the rescue team outside soon heard her.

"There's someone here! Come quickly!"

Amidst the sound of hurried footsteps, rescue team members began digging through the rubble.

After about three or four hours, with occasional aftershocks making them cautious, fearing further harm to those trapped, Christina and William were finally rescued by morning.

Christina was exhausted, and William was still unconscious, but thankfully, he didn't seem to be in any immediate danger.

His left leg was stiff from being trapped under a rock for too long, but otherwise, he was okay.

At a safe location, Christina and William were taken to a medical tent for a temporary check-up.

"Doctor, how is he?"

The doctor put down his tools and reassured Christina, "Don't worry, your boyfriend is fine. He's just unconscious. I've arranged for a nurse to give him an IV. Let him rest, and he should wake up in two or three hours."

Ignoring the doctor's use of "boyfriend," Christina focused on the fact that William was okay, finally breathing a sigh of relief.

Thank goodness William was fine. If he had been in danger because of her, she would have felt guilty forever.

"Thank you, doctor."

Watching the doctor leave, Christina sat back down beside William, her thoughts growing more complicated as she looked at his sleeping face.

He had saved her so many times, all in hopes of getting back together with her.

But Christina no longer had the same heart as before. She couldn't bring herself to accept a man who had once hurt her daughter.

Perhaps it was the relief of being back in a safe place, or knowing that William was out of danger, but Christina soon fell asleep in the small chair beside William.

When William woke up, he saw a tired Christina curled up in the chair, her brows furrowed even in sleep, as if she couldn't find peace even in her dreams.

Looking down at himself, William realized that all his wounds had been bandaged.

He was in a medical tent, with several other beds occupied by residents injured in the earthquake.

He tried to sit up, but pain shot through his back, and he collapsed back onto the bed.

"You're awake?"

Hearing the noise, Christina opened her eyes, rubbing her sleepy face as she looked at the now-awake William.

"Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you."

William hadn't expected Christina to be such a light sleeper. He had only accidentally fallen back onto the bed, and she had immediately woken up.

His heart ached slightly, and despite his injuries, he asked with concern, "Are you hurt from the earthquake? Are you feeling okay?"

"I'm fine."

Christina didn't avoid William's gaze, calmly shaking her head. "Just some minor injuries. They'll heal in a few days."

"But you, do you need me to call the doctor?"

"No need."

William shook his head, looking at Christina with serious eyes. "As long as you're okay, I'm relieved."

Perhaps his gaze was too intense, and Christina couldn't help but turn her face away, her cheeks flushing, though her heart remained calm.

He wanted to rekindle their relationship, but such tricks wouldn't work on her anymore.

To ease the awkward atmosphere, Christina stood up and walked out. "I'll see if there's anything to eat. You should drink something to regain your strength."

Watching Christina leave in a hurry, William smiled, undeterred.

There were too many misunderstandings between him and Christina. It didn't matter if she didn't like him now.

There was still plenty of time, and William believed he could slowly heal Christina's wounded heart.

When Christina returned, she was holding two sets of disposable utensils and a bowl of plain oatmeal.

"The doctor said you haven't eaten in a long time, so you need something light. Have some to regain your strength."

Christina handed the utensils to William and took the other set for herself, sipping the oatmeal slowly.

"My hand hurts, I can't hold the spoon."

William pouted, looking at Christina with a pitiful and helpless expression.

Christina sighed. If it were the old her, she might have given in.

But now, she simply said, "If you can't hold it, wait a bit. The oatmeal is still hot."

Her words made William's heart ache, and sadness welled up uncontrollably.

"But I got hurt protecting you. Are you really going to let me starve?"

The medical tent was crowded, and an elderly woman on the next bed saw the scene and couldn't help but tease.

"Did you have a fight with your boyfriend?"

Christina was taken aback, instinctively denying, "We're not a couple..."

"Alright, I get it, you're still mad."

The elderly woman smiled knowingly. "Your boyfriend is already making concessions. Besides, it was an earthquake. He protected you the whole time. No matter how angry you are, you should let it go."

The elderly man beside her also chimed in with a smile, "Yes, you look like a couple in love. It's normal to have little arguments, but don't let it affect your relationship."

Others in the tent joined in the teasing.

"Ah, young love. My boyfriend used to coax me to eat too, but now we're old!"

Some of the residents were locals, while others, like Christina, were from Valoria, and most could speak the language.

Embarrassed by the teasing, Christina glared at the smirking William, reluctantly taking the utensils from his hand and feeding him the oatmeal.

William looked pleased, but seeing Christina's unhappy face, he obediently lowered his head and ate.

After finishing the oatmeal, Christina hummed and borrowed a phone to call home and let them know she was safe.

Fortunately, the earthquake wasn't too severe, and after a few hours of aftershocks, it finally subsided.

Christina and William were temporarily housed in an apartment provided by their partners to recover.

Their business trip would have to wait until William was well enough to continue.

Their partners were understanding, knowing that the earthquake was an act of nature and that the collaboration wasn't urgent.

So, besides resting and recovering, Christina and William had some extra time to explore and relax, treating it as a chance to unwind.

###chapter 288: Put Me Down!

Christina rolled her eyes, watching William, who was almost fully recovered but still using the excuse of protecting her to boss her around.

Even though it was just small tasks like fetching coffee or grabbing a file, William clearly wanted to use this as an opportunity to spend more time with her. Christina had no choice but to grit her teeth and comply.

By the time William was almost fully recovered, a month had passed.

During this period, William found various reasons to create opportunities to spend time with Christina.

Besides that, the collaboration project was nearly complete, with only the final touches remaining.

As for Christina, she hadn't been much help from the start, mostly just tweaking some design images, so she wasn't too exhausted.

A month flew by, and Christina finished the final version of the design proposal. She stretched lazily, looking at the darkening sky outside the window.

This month, she had been balancing rest and work, and the collaboration project was successfully completed.

Thinking back to her time here, first experiencing an earthquake and then being busy with work, she realized she hadn't even had a chance to properly explore this small foreign town.

Christina decided to change clothes and take a simple stroll around.

Just as she was about to leave, she ran into William, who was taking a walk in the courtyard.

Seeing William, Christina instinctively frowned and tried to walk past him.

However, William wasn't about to let such a good opportunity slip by. He quickly caught up to her and asked with concern, "It's getting late. Where are you going? How about I come with you?"

"No need."

Christina shook her head and continued walking, but William persistently followed her.

"The town's not very safe at night. Don't worry, I won't bother you. Just think of me as a free security guard, okay?"

Faced with William's persistence, Christina felt helpless.

Remembering how he had risked his life to protect her a month ago, she couldn't bring herself to refuse him too harshly. She nodded reluctantly.

"Fine, you can come along."

Though Christina still wore a cold expression, William didn't mind. He confidently walked beside her.

Due to the earthquake at the estate, they were now staying in an apartment in a small suburban town.

The town's scenery was quite nice, and the fresh scent of rain-soaked earth filled the air, making it refreshing.

As Christina walked, she admired the scenery and almost forgot William was there.

William, on the other hand, couldn't help but speak softly as he watched Christina's relaxed profile.

"If you like it here, why not stay a bit longer?"

Christina snapped back to reality at William's voice and shook her head.

"No, we should head back in a couple of days."

Although she had only been here for a month, Christina's thoughts were constantly with Harper.

She wondered how Harper was doing with the assistant.

Harper was usually quiet and well-behaved, though sometimes mischievous, he knew his limits and shouldn't be causing trouble.

Seeing Christina's sudden return to rationality, William couldn't help but feel a bit regretful.

He wished he could keep Christina happy and not let his presence affect her.

But he couldn't bear the thought of leaving her side.

They walked in silence, neither saying a word.

As night fell, the town became quite lively. A nearby quaint bar caught Christina's eye.

The bar had a vintage, elegant exterior that didn't quite match the typical bar vibe.

But through the windows, the retro decor inside piqued Christina's interest as a designer.

Noticing Christina's interest, William walked alongside her without saying much. Soon, they reached the bar's entrance.

"Moonlit Spirits."

The bar's name intrigued Christina, and she pushed open the wooden door handle to enter.

Inside, a bartender was mixing drinks at the bar, while a wall of books lined the other side, filled with a variety of titles.

The room wasn't crowded, and the patrons were quietly reading or drinking, creating a serene and pleasant atmosphere.

"What can I get you? Maybe a coffee?" A young woman with a friendly smile approached Christina.

"A latte, please," Christina replied automatically and found a place to sit.

William also ordered a coffee, and they sat in silence. Christina glanced around the bar and noticed a small potted plant on the counter.

The plant had a miniature tree with red strings tied to it, each string holding a wooden plaque.

Curious, Christina examined the plaques and saw they were covered in people's wishes.

"Would you like to make a wish?" The young woman returned with their coffees and placed them in front of William and Christina.

"Are these all wishes from customers?" Christina asked, intrigued.

The plaques had wishes for family happiness, work success, and more.

"Yes," the girl smiled and glanced at William with a hint of envy. "You and your boyfriend are both so good-looking. If you make a wish, it will surely come true."

Christina was used to being mistaken for a couple with William and didn't bother to correct her. She smiled faintly, took the blank plaque the girl handed her, and wrote a line.

Seeing this, William also picked up a plaque and wrote something.

After they hung their plaques on the tree, Christina had nearly finished her coffee. Without looking at William, she paid and turned to leave.

From start to finish, Christina hadn't said a word to William.

William didn't mind and was about to follow her when he noticed the words on her plaque.

"Hope Harper stays safe and happy."

He was momentarily stunned but quickly chased after Christina as she was about to leave.

But just then, something unexpected happened!

As Christina left the bar and turned the corner of an alley, a knife suddenly appeared, aiming straight for her abdomen!

Fortunately, Christina reacted quickly, and the knife wasn't too close. She dodged in time, avoiding the knife but still getting a cut on her arm.

Seeing this, William's heart tightened. He rushed over and kicked the assailant before they could strike again.

The masked and hatted attacker fell to the ground and fled in panic.

William wanted to chase after them but saw Christina's injured arm and turned back.

He tore a piece of cloth from his shirt and wrapped it around her arm, saying, "I'll take you to the hospital first!"

Christina shook her head to refuse, but William scooped her up and walked forward without hesitation.

"Put me down!" Christina was furious, trying to hide the strange feeling in her heart. "If you don't put me down, I'll never speak to you again!"

"Fine, don't speak to me then," William replied with a bitter smile, walking forward while looking at Christina's lips. "If you keep talking, I'll kiss you right now."

People around them started to stare, and Christina had no choice but to take a deep breath and look away.

She was frustrated, but William was being stubborn and shameless, like a rogue. She didn't know how to deal with him!

No, once they returned home, she had to draw a clear line with him! She couldn't let him take advantage and win Harper's favor!

They soon arrived at the hospital. Though small, the town's hospital could handle a cut.

Seeing her arm bandaged, William still wasn't reassured.

The earlier dangerous moment kept replaying in his mind, making it hard to stay calm.

Even though they were abroad, someone still targeted Christina.

If they didn't find out who, Christina would remain in danger!

This potential threat had to be eliminated before it could grow.

His eyes were cold, but when he looked at Christina, they were warm and gentle.

###chapter 289 Acute Leukemia

"You sit tight here for a bit, I gotta handle something."

Christina watched William leave, his face cold and stern. Even if he didn't say anything, she knew exactly what he was dealing with.

She had narrowly avoided being stabbed in the stomach earlier, and William was extremely concerned about her safety. He was definitely going to find out who was behind it.

She sighed at the thought.

In her previous life, no matter what she did, she couldn't win William's heart.

But in this life, William treated her like a precious gem, getting anxious over the slightest bump or scrape.

The stark contrast between the two lives brought a sarcastic smile to Christina's face.

When William returned, he saw the mocking smile on Christina's face.

His heart ached, but he approached her with a gentle, concerned smile.

"Feeling any better? Hungry? How about I grab you something to eat?"

Christina shook her head and looked away calmly. "Since the business deal is almost done, if there's nothing else, maybe we should head back home in the next couple of days."

She was eager to see Harper again.

Although she had traveled for work before and left Harper in the care of a good friend, this time was different.

This time, she had almost been harmed abroad. If someone was targeting Harper back home, what would she do?

The thought made Christina anxious, wishing she could fly back home immediately to be with Harper.

William noticed Christina's worry and nodded.

"Alright, I'll book the tickets back home. We can leave tomorrow morning."

Hearing they could go home didn't ease Christina's mind.

As long as she wasn't with Harper, she couldn't fully calm down.

But when they returned home the next day, seeing Harper run towards her at the airport, Christina finally breathed a sigh of relief and hugged Harper tightly.

"Did you miss Mommy while she was away for a month?"

Christina's smile was almost melting as she looked at Harper.

"Of course I did!"

Harper counted on her fingers, looking serious. "I counted the days every day, waiting for Mommy to come back. I'm so happy you're back!"

Christina couldn't help but laugh at Harper's serious expression, feeling amused.

She playfully tapped Harper's nose, her heart softening.

"Mommy missed you too, Harper. You look like you've gained a little weight. Have you been sneaking snacks?"

"No way!"

Harper put her hands on her hips, her round face full of guilt. "I only ate a little bit every day. I listened to the assistant and waited for Mommy to come back!"

Then Harper ran to William, hugging his arm.

"Of course, I also thought about Mr. Cavendish every day!"

William laughed and picked Harper up with his long arms.

"Such a good girl. How about I reward you by taking you and Mommy out for dinner?"

Harper's eyes lit up instantly, nodding eagerly.

"Yes, yes! Harper will do whatever Mr. Cavendish says!"

Harper, like a little doll, was so obedient and sweet that William couldn't bear to let her go.

Christina watched the warm scene, feeling increasingly uneasy.

They were father and daughter, but in the previous life, they never had such moments of warmth.

Even if they did, it was fleeting.

If it weren't for William, how could their daughter have lost her heart?

But in this life, Harper was with her again, and Christina would never let the tragedy of the previous life happen again.

She collected her thoughts and didn't stop William and Harper from interacting, allowing the three of them to go out for dinner together.

The assistant drove them to a large shopping center.

Inside, there was a burger joint. Considering she hadn't spent much time with Harper recently, Christina generously allowed Harper to have a burger.

Harper was overjoyed, playing happily in the kids' area after eating, completely forgetting about the two adults.

Watching Harper laugh and play in the kids' area, Christina couldn't help but smile.

William was about to say something to Christina when his phone rang unexpectedly.

He was about to hang up but frowned at the caller ID and decided to answer, stepping aside.

Christina noticed, glanced at William's cold expression, and calmly looked away.

Whatever William did now had nothing to do with her. Why should she care?

After just two minutes, William returned.

He looked at Christina, worried she might misunderstand, and explained, "They found the person who tried to attack you abroad."

Christina's expression turned serious.

"Who was it?"

William's jaw tightened, his face cold.

"It was a foreign resident, but he was an illegal immigrant. He confessed that someone paid him a sum of money, promising more if he succeeded in killing you."

"But the person who hired him, I'm still investigating. It likely has something to do with Jennifer."

Christina's face turned cold, her lips curling in a mocking smile.

"So, if Jennifer is behind this, will you take action?"

William panicked and quickly shook his head. "Don't worry, if I find out Jennifer is behind this, I won't let you suffer."

Christina just smiled, not taking his promise to heart.

In the previous life, William did even worse things for Jennifer.

Even if he knew everything in this life, Christina wouldn't bet on it.

Knowing Christina didn't trust him, William felt defeated and sighed.

"I know you don't trust me, but I'll prove it to you."

Christina smiled indifferently. "Alright, do as you see fit. Just don't let it affect me and Harper."

William felt a wave of helplessness but wanted to explain further when Harper walked over, looking unwell.

"Harper, what's wrong?"

Seeing Harper suddenly looking ill, her face flushed, Christina's heart tightened. She quickly checked Harper's forehead.

"You're burning up, Harper! You have a fever!"

Harper weakly leaned against Christina, whispering, "Mommy, I feel awful..."

"Harper, hang in there. Mommy will take you to the hospital!"

Christina's heart raced as she picked Harper up and hurried outside.

William, equally anxious, immediately brought the car around, stopping beside them.

"Get in, I'll take you to the hospital!"

Christina got in the car with Harper, and William drove quickly to the hospital.

Fortunately, the hospital wasn't far, and they arrived shortly.

At the pediatric department, Christina paced anxiously while William tried to comfort her.

"Christina, don't worry. Harper just has a fever. The hospital will treat her quickly. She'll be fine."

Christina shook her head, lips tightly pressed, saying nothing.

William wouldn't understand.

In the previous life, she and Harper depended on each other, but Harper still left her.

In this life, she managed to change Harper's fate, saving her.

But now Harper had a fever, and they didn't know what was wrong.

No matter how hard she tried, was it all in vain?

Christina's mind was filled with doubt, but just then, the doctor came out.

"Doctor, how is Harper?"

Seeing the anxious couple, the doctor sympathetically looked at Christina and sighed. "Please come to my office."

Christina's heart sank.

If it were just a fever, the doctor wouldn't be so serious.

Her mind raced, but a warm, dry hand gently held hers.

She looked up to see William's reassuring eyes.

"Don't be afraid. Let's go in and see. Harper will be okay."

Christina nodded instinctively, forgetting to pull her hand away in her worry for Harper.

They entered the office, where the doctor looked at them seriously.

"Your child has acute leukemia. You need to be prepared."

"Doctor, what did you say?"

Hearing "acute leukemia," Christina felt her mind explode, almost unable to stand.

"Christina!"

William quickly supported her, suppressing his shock and forcing himself to stay calm. "Doctor, tell us what we need to do next."

The doctor sighed and said, "You need to admit her to the hospital immediately. If you can find a bone marrow match quickly, surgery is the best option."

William nodded, holding Christina close. "Christina, don't worry. I'll do everything I can to make sure Harper is okay."

With the Cavendish family's resources, finding a bone marrow match worldwide shouldn't be difficult.

Christina was too panicked to think about her issues with William, just nodding.

Harper was also William's daughter, so he should help.

But she had worked so hard to change Harper's fate, and now Harper had leukemia.

No matter how hard she tried, was she still trapped by the previous life's fate?

Christina couldn't help but smile bitterly. The doctor, seeing this, sympathetically suggested, "I recommend you consider having another child. The new baby might save Harper and give her a future companion."

"There aren't many suitable bone marrow matches for children. You should think about it."

Christina instinctively looked at William, hesitating for the first time.

She had wanted to avoid any connection with William for Harper's sake.

But now, for Harper's survival, Christina had no other choice.

Harper was her everything. She couldn't lose her.

William saw Christina's expression and sighed softly.

"Thank you, doctor. We'll consider it."

###chapter 290: Altering Memory

As they left the doctor's office and entered the hospital room, they saw Harper still asleep on the bed.

The child was curled up, even her breathing was restless while she slept.

Such a small child, yet she had leukemia.

Christina's eyes instantly reddened, and she wiped away a tear, looking particularly fragile.

Remembering what the doctor had just said, Christina turned around and, for the first time in her life, looked seriously at William.

"William, let's have another child, for Harper's sake..."

She couldn't finish her sentence. Seeing William's tightly pressed lips and silence, she forced a bitter smile.

"Of course, if you don't want to, just pretend I didn't say anything."

"I want to."

At that moment, William gently pulled Christina into his arms, his voice firm and serious.

"Whether it's for Harper or for us, as long as you need me, as long as it's for Harper's good, I'll do anything you ask."

Feeling the strong, steady heartbeat next to her ear, Christina couldn't hold back anymore, and her tears quickly soaked William's shirt.

For a moment, they were both silent. Even when they returned to William's house, Christina's eyes were still red.

In the empty living room, it was just the two of them. Christina looked at William and forced a smile.

"I'm going to take a shower first, wait for me."

William nodded, his eyes deeply fixed on Christina's retreating figure, his heart filled with complex emotions.

Their daughter urgently needed help, and if this was a way to save Harper, he was willing.

Thinking of his past actions, William felt both guilt and relief that he had found a way to help his daughter.

He hoped that this time, it wouldn't be too late, and Harper could safely get through this.

After about ten minutes, Christina came out wrapped in a towel.

Looking at Christina, William sighed softly and pulled her into his arms.

Everything seemed to be falling into place, but just as William, slightly breathless, was about to kiss her, Christina turned her face away, her mind flashing back to the past.

In the previous life, Harper's body had gradually grown cold in her arms, her breath fading away.

Yet William hadn't spared them a glance, his heart entirely occupied by another woman and her son.

William knew Christina had a mental block.

So he suggested, "How about we try IVF?"

Christina was about to agree when her phone rang: "Ms. Windsor, something's wrong, your daughter has been taken!"

Christina immediately panicked.

She and William rushed to the hospital.

Jennifer looked at the child in her arms, her eyes filled with malice.

She stared out the window, muttering to herself.

"Christina, since you were heartless, don't blame me for being ruthless. I thought we wouldn't have to be so ugly, but I was wrong."

As Jennifer finished speaking, the car stopped, but her gaze remained fixed outside.

The driver's voice came, "Ma'am, we've arrived."

Jennifer snapped out of her thoughts, carrying the child out of the car.

Jennifer entered an apartment she had bought earlier, initially planning to sell it, but it turned out to be useful now.

She threw the child onto the couch and made a call, "Are you sure?"

Jennifer was stern, "I need 100% memory alteration, 100% success."

The person on the other end was silent for a moment before speaking, "It's not impossible, but your request is difficult. I need foreign drugs, and you'll have to do the brainwashing yourself later."

He even emphasized, "Memory alteration only gives the child a basic idea, the rest is up to you."

Jennifer scoffed, "I never said I wasn't willing. Do it, and I'll bring the child over."

After hanging up, Jennifer caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror.

Her face was twisted and terrifying.

She was startled and furious.

If it weren't for Christina, she wouldn't have become like this.

Thinking of this, Jennifer didn't care anymore. She grabbed the child from the couch.

Holding the child, Jennifer called a cab and left.

At the facility, Casey West saw the child in Jennifer's arms and hesitated. "Are you sure you wanna do this?"

Casey had liked Jennifer for a long time and was willing to do anything for her, but using a child for this experiment felt wrong.

Jennifer's face hardened. "Didn't you say you'd do anything for me? If you won't, I'll find someone else."

Seeing her so extreme, Casey knew he couldn't persuade her. He pressed his lips together and said softly, "I didn't mean that. I'll do it. Leave the child here."

Jennifer placed the child on the nearby equipment.

Casey began the procedure.

Jennifer looked at her phone and asked, "When will the memory alteration be complete?"

Casey was honest, "It's difficult. The child's nerves are fragile. If it goes wrong, the child could be paralyzed or mentally impaired."

The child's body wasn't fully developed, so there were risks.

But Jennifer didn't care.

Hearing this, Jennifer sneered, "I don't care. Just give me a time, and I'll come back."

"To completely alter the memory, it will take about two weeks. Don't worry, I'll take good care of the child during this time."

Casey's words made Jennifer frown, "Why so long? You said it wouldn't take this long."

"Do you want to take a bigger risk?"

There were risks, but Casey didn't mention them.

He could see Jennifer was anxious.

Even if he told her, she would argue, so he ignored the small percentage of risk.

"Fine, let me know when it's done."

Jennifer left with her phone.

Originally, Jennifer planned to directly retaliate against William and Christina, demanding a large sum of money after kidnapping the child.

But thinking of William's situation, Jennifer felt unsatisfied.

So she changed her mind halfway.

Meanwhile, William and Christina were frantic.

Christina was breaking down, "How could this happen? Who took Harper?"

She had been willing to have another child with William to save Harper.

But now, Harper was missing.

Christina thought of Parker, Raymond, and Grace, but they all had alibis.

William held Christina, "I'm here. I won't let anything happen to Harper. I'll find her!"

Christina suddenly thought of someone.

Matthew!

He had saved her from the sea, and she had started to see him as a friend, but the events of four years ago were still fresh in her mind. She had rejected him again on the cruise, and she couldn't be sure his obsession was gone.

Maybe Matthew was trying to force her!

She immediately contacted Matthew.

Matthew was straightforward, "Christina, if I wanted to keep you, I wouldn't have let you off the cruise, nor would I have arranged for someone to help you avoid Parker."

If it wasn't Matthew, then who?

Matthew also offered, "I'll help you find this person."

Christina weakly hung up.

William, standing beside her, heard every word of her conversation with Matthew.

He didn't know Matthew.

But even if he was jealous, what could he do?

He had brought this upon himself.

Unexpectedly, Christina received another call.

An unknown number.

Christina quickly answered.

"Want to know where your child is?" Jennifer used a voice changer.

Christina was frantic, almost shouting, "Where is my child?"

Jennifer laughed softly, "The child is fine with me."

Jennifer thought for a moment, "How about this, I'm not unreasonable. Give me $30 million, and I'll send you a video of the child alive. Otherwise, prepare for the worst."

Christina was stunned.

William gently patted her back and gave her a look.

Christina took a deep breath, calming herself, "How can I be sure you're telling the truth? Is the child really with you?"

"You've pushed me this far. If I don't retaliate, it's impossible. You know me, I don't do things I'm not sure of."

Jennifer shouted angrily.

At that moment, Christina remembered Jennifer, "Are you Jennifer?"

###chapter 291 You Really Make Me Sick

Jennifer saw that Christina had already figured her out, so she decided to drop the act.

She turned off the voice changer and sneered, "It's me."

Christina exploded, "Jennifer, are you nuts? Harper's just a kid!"

"Innocent? If it weren't for you messing things up, William would be mine! It's been four years. You were supposed to be dead, so why did you come back?"

Jennifer's eyes burned with anger.

It was bad enough that Christina came back, but she had to bring a child with her.

What hope did Jennifer have left?

So she had a thought: if Harper died, Christina would lose all hope.

If Christina and her daughter both died, Jennifer could try harder, and William would naturally be hers.

But she hadn't expected that Christina would see through her carefully laid plan.

No way!

Jennifer immediately hung up the phone; she had no interest in talking to Christina anymore.

She had only one thought now: she couldn't be Jennifer anymore.

So she went straight to Casey.

Casey saw her rushing in and frowned, "Jennifer, what's going on?"

Jennifer said, "Quick, turn me into someone else, and then send Harper back to Christina. No, wait, we need to fake my death first."

That way, in Christina and William's eyes, Jennifer would be dead. When she returned as someone else, they wouldn't be suspicious.

Casey understood.

And so, they began their meticulous preparations.

As for Harper?

Casey altered her memory and, to avoid her waking up distressed, injected her with a sedative, saving a lot of trouble.

Jennifer took a photo of Harper and sent it to Christina.

Christina was frantic when she saw it, "What have you done to Harper?"

Christina bombarded her with voice messages.

But Jennifer didn't reply. After a long time, she finally sent Christina a message, "If you want your daughter safe, have William come to me personally for a deal!"

Christina saw the message and immediately showed it to William.

William used his phone to contact Jennifer.

Jennifer knew William's number by heart.

So she answered instantly.

"William."

Jennifer called out intimately, but William was uninterested, "Where's Harper?"

Jennifer felt a pang of sorrow. She had followed William for so many years, and he had once been grateful to her for saving his life.

But since Christina appeared, everything changed.

Jennifer gritted her teeth, "If you want to know where Harper is, come to the abandoned iron factory at 23 Suburban Road!"

She hung up immediately, not giving William time to think.

Of course, William wouldn't ignore Jennifer's whereabouts.

He and Christina had the same goal: to rescue Harper!

William quickly informed Bob of the location. After investigating, Bob found out that 23 Suburban Road was an abandoned iron factory.

Bob, who had been with William for many years, didn't need William to spell it out. He immediately started planning.

Meanwhile, Jennifer had one request for Casey, "Casey, whether I live or die depends on you!"

Casey held Jennifer's hand, "Don't worry, I won't let you die!"

Three hours later, at the abandoned iron factory.

Jennifer appeared, holding Harper.

William arrived on time, but Christina was with him.

Christina was immediately anxious, "What have you done to Harper?"

When Jennifer sent the photo, Harper was asleep. Now she was still asleep, which was very unusual!

Jennifer's face darkened, "Didn't I tell you to come alone? William, what is this? If you don't follow my instructions, I'll throw Harper to her death!"

"No!"

Christina screamed, heart-wrenchingly.

William was desperate to negotiate, "Jennifer, what do you want?"

"William, if you're willing to marry me and be with me now, I'll let your daughter go. How about that?"

Jennifer smiled at William.

She had liked William for many years, but he was a cold person. She had been eager to drug him.

She hadn't expected Christina to beat her to it.

And then Christina joined the architecture firm, ruining her career. Every time she thought about it, she was furious! Why?

Even if some of her work was plagiarized, most of it was her own effort. But Christina destroyed it all.

Christina was her nemesis!

No! Christina was targeting her specifically.

Jennifer gritted her teeth, "Christina, if you die now, I'll let your daughter Harper go."

"Then let Harper go first!"

For her daughter, Christina was willing to die. But she had to ensure Harper's safety first.

Jennifer sneered, "Do you think you have the right to negotiate with me now?"

Jennifer raised Harper high. Harper was in her hands; she had the leverage!

"You die first. Isn't William still here to take care of Harper? Don't worry, I've already altered Harper's memory. She doesn't remember you now. Hahaha!" Jennifer laughed maniacally.

This enraged Christina. In her past life, Jennifer had flaunted her son Mike in front of her.

Now, she was targeting Christina's daughter.

If Jennifer was going to do this to her, she might as well take her daughter and perish with Jennifer!

Christina went berserk and charged at Jennifer.

She wanted to snatch Harper away!

But Jennifer wouldn't let her succeed.

Jennifer threw Harper aside. William, who was rushing over, caught Harper. Jennifer pulled out a knife to stab Christina.

Christina dodged, and they wrestled.

William tried to help, but Jennifer, like a madwoman, charged at him.

The difference in strength between men and women was clear; Jennifer was no match for William.

William grabbed Jennifer's wrist, but she turned the knife on herself, "William, I've loved you for so long, but you love Christina. If I'm going to die, I'll die in your arms!"

Jennifer stabbed herself, blood gushing out.

She collapsed to the ground.

William didn't help her up; he looked at her coldly, "Jennifer, you're truly disgusting!"

With that, William turned away, never looking back at Jennifer.

###chapter 292 Thora White

Jennifer forced a bitter smile. "Look at that, cold-hearted William," she muttered. She was supposed to be the one married to William, but Christina had swooped in and taken her place!

She was filled with hatred!

William and Christina left with their child, but soon after, a massive fire broke out at the steel mill.

This was William's doing. He wanted Jennifer to die cleanly, ensuring she could never appear before him again!

However, they hadn't anticipated that after they left, Casey would quickly arrive, pick up Jennifer, feed her a small pill, and administer acupuncture.

He held Jennifer close. "Jennifer, you're too foolish. How could you take such a risky move?"

Jennifer smiled bitterly. "Because I love him..."

Meanwhile, Christina took the child to the hospital.

Joseph personally examined the child, finding no abnormalities.

But Jennifer's words still echoed in Christina's mind.

Christina was frantic. "Joseph, please, you have to check again. I can't let anything happen to Harper!"

No matter the cost, Harper couldn't be harmed!

Joseph was doing everything he could to examine Harper.

There were still no abnormalities until Harper woke up and vehemently rejected Christina. "Get away from me! You're not my mom! Where's my mom? I want my mom!"

This was heartbreaking for Christina.

Her beloved daughter didn't remember her!

Not just her, but William too!

Harper was rejecting both of them. "I don't know you! Stay away from me! Don't come near me!"

This was devastating for them. Harper's leukemia hadn't even been cured yet, and now this was happening. It was like tearing Christina's heart apart.

William was deeply hurt, but he knew he had to be stronger than Christina.

He comforted Christina. "Christina, don't be afraid. As long as we persist and work together, we can bring Harper back to her senses."

Joseph even suggested, "Given Harper's current condition, she needs treatment. Since she's rejecting you, why not hire a nanny?"

Given their situation, hiring a nanny was the most reliable option.

Christina wanted to care for Harper herself, but since Harper was rejecting her, this was the only solution.

Meanwhile, Jennifer was being rescued by Casey, and everything was going according to plan.

Casey transformed Jennifer, giving her a new identity as Thora White, the youngest daughter of the White Family, and she returned to Stargate City.

Casey used the best medication, but her recovery period was supposed to be half a month.

Jennifer was anxious. "Half a month is too long! I need to be back in Stargate City within five days!"

"Jennifer, that's impossible. Everything takes time..."

"I don't want to hear that, Casey. You're the best medical researcher, right? You know so many people and have achieved so much! This should be a piece of cake for you!"

Jennifer interrupted Casey before he could finish.

Jennifer's agitation made her look somewhat ferocious.

Casey felt sorry for her. "Don't get so worked up. It's bad for your health. I'll help you. I'll do everything as you say."

Casey not only felt sorry for her but also loved her, willing to do anything for her, even if it meant risking his own life.

For the next five days, Jennifer endured a grueling regimen of medications and injections.

Her body fought against the drugs, and some reactions nearly killed her. But she pushed through it all with one thought in mind: she had to return to William under a new identity!

During these five days, Christina and William were desperately searching for a nanny but had no luck.

Until the seventh day.

Joseph, as Harper's attending physician, took Harper for a walk. Harper saw a woman in a white dress approaching and immediately ran up to her.

"Mommy!"

Joseph quickly ran over. "Harper, you've got the wrong person. This isn't your mom!"

"No, I didn't get it wrong. She is my mommy!" Harper clung to the woman and refused to let go, leaving Joseph helpless.

Until Christina and William arrived.

They couldn't let their daughter cling to a stranger and call her mommy, nor could they let Harper affect others.

Christina wanted to forcibly take Harper away.

Unexpectedly, the woman squatted down and gently stroked Harper's head. "Sweetie, you've got the wrong person. I'm not your mommy."

"No, you are!"

Harper was stubborn.

The woman had no choice. "Okay, I am. But can you listen to mommy and let go of me first?"

"Okay."

Harper obediently complied.

This scene surprised Christina and William, but it pained Christina even more.

Her well-behaved, closest daughter was calling someone else mommy and being so intimate with her!

Unexpectedly, Harper followed the woman.

Christina had an idea. Why not let this woman take care of Harper first, and then she could slowly build a relationship with Harper?

For Harper's sake, she approached the woman.

The woman was startled. "I just arrived in this city to reunite with my family. I'm not even married yet. Asking me to take care of your daughter might not be appropriate. I still need to get married in the future."

"You can stay at my place. As long as you don't go out, no one will know." Christina's mind was solely focused on Harper, not considering the consequences.

William secretly took a photo of the woman and investigated her, discovering that she was Thora White, the youngest daughter of the White Family, recently brought back from the countryside.

Her background was clean.

So, William shared Christina's idea and even proposed, "It's not free to take care of Harper. I'll pay you one billion dollars."

Thora secretly sneered. She hadn't expected William and Christina to go to such lengths for Harper!

But then again, how could she pass up such a good opportunity?

So, Thora was invited into William's mansion to take care of Harper, and the White Family was also supported by William.

However, William remained cautious, having someone secretly observe Thora.

For over half a month, Thora showed no abnormalities. Under her care, Harper gradually returned to her lively self.

Thora even facilitated interactions between Christina and Harper, becoming good friends with Christina.

But Christina never expected that her newly made friend would eventually cause a rift because of a photo, a shocking revelation that left Christina unable to react for a long time.

###chapter 293 You Don't Need to Explain to Me

One was William, who had been chasing after her, constantly begging for her forgiveness and professing his love.

The other was Thora, whom she had just started to trust and consider a friend.

William and Thora were together now, and they had sent Christina a suggestive photo.

Especially when Christina saw the photo, she was in the middle of giving her daughter Harper some medicine!

If Christina said she didn't believe it at all, that would be a lie.

If William and Thora really had nothing going on, then how was this photo taken?

Unexpectedly, William found her, and he was so anxious, "Christina, let me explain..."

William, in a hurry, quickly tried to explain the situation.

However, Christina didn't want to listen anymore. She took a step back, raised her hands to block him, and resisted William's approach.

"Enough, I don't want to hear any of your explanations."

Christina shook her head, her angry expression disappearing completely, replaced by cold indifference and detachment.

It was as if there had never been any relationship between them.

"You can be with whoever you want; that's your choice. There's really no need to explain so much to me, right?"

Christina said coldly and turned to leave.

She didn't go home but went outside.

She felt a bit frustrated, and unexpectedly, Harper called her!

But it was William's voice.

"Christina, it's really not what you think!"

William was extremely anxious, feeling very disappointed that Christina didn't believe him, but he had no grounds to blame her.

If it weren't for Harper being the link between them, they probably wouldn't have any relationship at all right now.

"Enough, you really don't need to explain to me."

Christina felt a sharp pain in her heart and didn't want to say another word to William. She hung up the phone directly.

After hanging up, she slowly exhaled, trying to ease the sadness and disappointment in her heart.

Although she had long since come to terms with everything and told herself not to care about William anymore.

The painful consequences of the past had already made her not want to have any connection with William.

But deciding is one thing.

To immediately sever all ties with someone she had truly loved for so many years wasn't something that could be done instantly.

She tried hard to push such thoughts out of her mind, but the more she tried, the clearer the sad emotions became in her mind.

And the fleeting pain on Christina's face was caught by Thora from a distance.

Thora's face instantly showed satisfaction, and she felt extremely pleased.

As long as she could see Christina in pain, see William and Christina tormenting each other.

Thora's goal was achieved.

However, when Christina looked up and saw Thora again, Thora walked over with a face full of sadness, feeling guilty and remorseful.

"I'm sorry, Ms. Windsor."

Thora wiped away the tears from the corner of her eyes, looking as sad as could be.

"I really didn't know these things would happen, and I didn't know it would cause such a big rift between you and Mr. Cavendish."

"If I had known, I shouldn't have stayed here and caused you so much trouble. It's all my fault."

After saying this, Thora didn't wait for Christina to respond and continued with guilt, "Forget it, since Harper has found her biological mother, I should leave to avoid causing you more trouble."

As soon as she finished speaking, Thora turned to leave.

But in the next second, Christina grabbed her arm.

Christina looked at Thora with a complex expression, her heart already a tangled mess.

"Wait a minute, Thora."

Christina took a deep breath, looking at Thora's sad and remorseful appearance, and sighed helplessly.

"Harper still needs you right now. If you leave her so abruptly, it will definitely have a bad impact on her."

"And this isn't your fault. I believe you wouldn't do something so excessive. Why don't you stay?"

Although she had some doubts in her heart, feeling that something was off.

But she remembered how Thora had taken care of Harper meticulously during this time, always by her side.

Just for this reason, Christina believed Thora wouldn't do such a thing. There must be some misunderstanding.

Moreover, she had been extremely busy these days, with no extra time to spend with Harper.

Having another woman to take care of her daughter, and this person genuinely caring for Harper, wasn't necessarily a bad thing.

"But William..."

Thora hesitated, looking very sad, "Christina, I don't know if I should say this, but if I don't, I really feel guilty."

Christina's heart moved slightly, and she said, "Go ahead, I'm listening."

Thora nodded, as if gathering courage, and said, "It's like this, that day, William grabbed my arm and mumbled your name, Christina."

She seemed to find it hard to say, "I think William mistook me for you, which is why he acted out of line."

"So, please don't be mad at him, okay? It's all my fault. If it weren't for me..."

Thora's words made Christina feel even worse.

Clearly, it wasn't Thora's fault, but because of Christina, a rift had formed.

"It's not your fault."

Christina forced a smile, her emotions extremely complex.

"Just stay here peacefully. Harper still needs you."

"As for the matter with William, I'll handle it. You don't need to worry."

Thora reluctantly nodded, still looking very apologetic.

In the end, it was Christina who comforted her for a while before Thora left, taking Harper to the toy room next door.

But.

Watching Harper walk away holding another woman's hand without even looking back at her, Christina still felt an uncontrollable pain in her heart.

She slowly exhaled, trying to suppress the indescribable emotions in her heart.

She recalled the photo she had seen earlier and decided not to think about it anymore. The most important thing now was to focus on preparing for the company's matters and find a way to minimize the impact of the negative rumors.

If it weren't for this, she wouldn't have temporarily handed Harper over to another woman.

She really didn't have the time to take good care of Harper, so she had no choice.

But thinking about Thora's fleeting guilty expression when she questioned her earlier.

Christina still felt a trace of doubt in her heart.

After thinking for a while, she decided to call the housekeeper.

###chapter 294 Observing Ms. White

"Clea, when you get a chance at home, keep an eye on Ms. White and see how she treats Harper, okay?"

"Got it, Ms. Windsor."

The nanny nodded without a second thought.

Christina and William had been living apart, but because of Harper's situation, they decided to stay together for a while. They wanted to take better care of Harper and help him get his memory back as soon as possible.

After getting everything sorted, Christina hurried to her studio. Seeing everyone looking stressed out, she instinctively rubbed her forehead. Harper's issue was still hanging over her, and now the studio was facing another crisis. It felt like there was a connection between the two, but Christina couldn't quite put her finger on it. She decided to set it aside for now.

"Ms. Windsor, thank goodness you're here!"

As soon as Christina walked in, the employees felt a wave of relief and quickly gathered around her.

"What's going on?" Christina asked, rubbing her temples as she sat at her desk, her expression serious.

"The situation online is getting worse. People are saying our studio survives by ripping off other people's ideas. A lot of companies and individuals we work with are threatening to cut ties," Zachary, Christina's assistant, said anxiously. "If this keeps up, our studio will lose its partnerships, and business will tank. We might even have to shut down..."

Realizing he was being too negative, Zachary quickly corrected himself, "I mean, we're being falsely accused. We'll be fine!"

The office fell silent. Christina pressed her lips together, feeling more and more agitated as she watched the negative comments online pile up. Kaia was swamped with calls from partners wanting to end their collaborations.

Determined, Christina made a call. "Dig into the source of this mess, especially the background of the party we just partnered with."

Christina had a gut feeling that the crisis was tied to the sudden new partnership. But she needed to confirm it through investigation.

"Ms. Windsor," someone asked hesitantly, "do you think this crisis is connected to the big contract we took on?"

Christina nodded, then shook her head. "It's just a hunch. We'll know for sure once we investigate."

She then had a flash of insight and opened the defamatory article, zooming in on a photo within it. The photo was of a design draft from their company, but it looked older. Christina was certain it was her original design, which no one else could have accessed. How it ended up with the reporters, she didn't know. But this breakthrough might help resolve the studio's crisis.

She immediately instructed Zachary, "Analyze this photo and prove it was deliberately aged."

"So, Ms. Windsor, you think someone is trying to smear us with this photo, right?" Zachary asked, excitedly.

Christina nodded, and Zachary almost jumped with enthusiasm. "Got it, Ms. Windsor. I'll get this evidence out ASAP!"

Christina's expression grew more serious as she looked at the photo. "This design draft is my original work. The computer at home has the original file, with timestamps proving it's mine."

"And Zachary, when we clarify this, make sure to involve a reputable studio to back us up."

Zachary understood immediately, "I get it, Ms. Windsor. If we clear our name ourselves, people might not believe us. But if a respected studio supports us, their word will be trusted."

Only then could they cleanse the studio's reputation and resolve the crisis.

With a plan in place, Christina calmly organized the team. "Zachary, handle the technical analysis. Xyla, gather the team for a meeting to draft a PR plan. Coordinate with Zachary and contact me once you have results."

Christina's composed demeanor and clear plan reassured everyone, easing their anxiety.

After arranging everything, Christina stretched, feeling exhausted but unable to think about anything else. Harper and the studio were her top priorities now. The thought of William gave her a headache.

Just then, someone knocked on her office door. Christina didn't think much of it and let them in. It was Zachary, looking hesitant.

"Is there another issue with the studio, or is there a problem with the PR plan?" Christina asked, concerned.

"Neither," Zachary replied, looking conflicted. "Mr. Cavendish is waiting outside the studio. He says he won't leave until he sees you."

Christina's expression froze. Why was William here? She knew he wanted to explain about Thora. With a cold smile, she said, "Tell him I'm not in the mood to talk. He should go home."

"But Mr. Cavendish said he knows you'd say that, and he won't leave until he sees you, even if he has to wait outside," Zachary said, looking more conflicted.

"Let him wait then. Don't bother with him," Christina said coldly, not looking up from her files. "Tell him he can wait for ten days or half a month; it doesn't matter to me."

###chapter 295: I Believe You Are Innocent

Christina's firm tone left Zachary with no choice but to nod in agreement.

"Alright, I'll let you get back to it. Once the planning's done, I'll swing by to hand things off."

Christina gave a slight nod, not looking up until she heard the office door click shut. Her face showed signs of fatigue, and her emotions were a tangled mess.

If William hadn't done anything wrong, why was he resting with Thora?

Even if nothing happened, it was enough to bother Christina deeply.

But if William had done something wrong, according to Thora, it was because he mistook Thora for her.

This indicated that William still had strong feelings for her.

Moreover, she had no right to blame William now.

The only thing connecting them was Harper, and nothing else.

Pushing aside her chaotic thoughts, Christina threw herself into her work, trying not to think too much.

Once everything was settled, Zachary managed to restore the original images, proving that everything had been doctored.

The PR department also had a solution ready.

After confirming there were no more issues, Christina glanced at the night outside the window and then at her watch.

It was already past ten at night.

Rubbing her tired temples, Christina stood up and instinctively thought of William.

Zachary had said that William would be waiting for her outside.

It was already past ten. Would he still be there?

A hint of worry flashed across Christina's face, but she quickly regained her composure, feeling annoyed with herself.

What did it matter if William was waiting outside?

If he wanted to wait, let him wait.

With a cold expression, Christina picked up her handbag and left the office.

As soon as she stepped out of the elevator, she saw William sitting anxiously on the sofa in the lobby.

He was staring intently at the elevator.

When he saw Christina, he quickly stood up and walked briskly towards her.

"Christina, I..."

Seeing the weary look on William's face, Christina turned away and walked past him without a word, her expression as cold as ice.

Watching her walk away, William felt a pang in his heart. He followed her, his face filled with anxiety and regret.

"Christina, please believe me. I didn't do anything with her."

"We're innocent. Others might not know, but you do. My heart has always been with you. How could I be interested in another woman?"

"William."

Christina suddenly stopped and turned to face him.

Seeing her resolute expression, William felt a sinking feeling, sensing something bad was about to happen.

But then Christina gave a wry smile, tinged with self-mockery.

"I believe you're innocent."

William's eyes lit up, but before he could say anything, Christina continued, "But you didn't control yourself. If you really cared about me, you would've kept your distance from other women. You wouldn't have ended up in the same bed as Thora."

With that one sentence, William felt a chill, understanding Christina's point.

She meant that William had allowed himself to be in a compromising situation with another woman, leading to unnecessary misunderstandings.

Though relieved that Christina believed him, the fact that he was suspected still pained him.

"Christina, I don't know how I ended up in the same bed as her, but believe me, I drank something spiked that night."

"I was set up. I haven't figured it out yet, but once I do, I'll prove my innocence to you!"

Thinking about being set up, William felt a surge of frustration.

As the CEO of Cavendish Corporation, he had been tricked at his own party.

If he hadn't been sure that he was unconscious and couldn't do anything, he couldn't imagine how furious he would be.

"Proving your innocence is your business."

Christina looked at him calmly, her voice steady.

"As for me, apart from Harper, there's nothing between us."

"I have no right to blame you. What you do next is none of my concern."

After saying this, Christina looked at the exhausted William and couldn't help but leave him with one last remark before walking away.

"Go home and rest. If there's anything about Harper, contact me. Otherwise, don't reach out."

With that, Christina walked away without looking back, disappearing from William's sight.

William stared blankly at her retreating figure, clenching his fists, his eyes darkening.

He vowed to find out who had drugged him. When he did, he would make them regret ever being born.

But with Christina's studio also in trouble, William had no time to dwell on his own issues. He picked up his phone and made a call.

"I need you to handle something for me."

After explaining the situation, the person on the other end replied respectfully, "Mr. Cavendish, don't worry. We'll take care of it!"

"We'll prove Ms. Windsor's studio's innocence and find out what happened at the party. No suspicious person will be overlooked!"

Nodding, William hung up.

Thinking of Harper, who was being cared for at home, his expression darkened.

First, Harper went missing, then was suddenly found but with amnesia, and Jennifer was dead.

Then Christina's studio had problems, and he was drugged, ending up in bed with Thora.

Though nothing happened between them, the series of events felt too coincidental.

William, always alert, felt something was off, as if he was missing something.

Frowning, he thought for a moment before making another call, his face stern.

###chapter 296: Find Out About This Woman Named Thora

"Hey, Mr. Cavendish, got any instructions for me?"

As soon as the call connected, the man on the other end spoke respectfully.

"Yeah, look into a woman named Thora. She's taking care of Harper at our place right now."

"Got it. You want the full scoop on her?"

"Exactly. I want to know everything about her, down to the last detail."

The man quickly responded, "Understood, Mr. Cavendish. We'll get on it right away. But..."

He hesitated, "Isn't Ms. White doing a good job with Miss Cavendish? Are you suspecting something..."

"I'm just being cautious," William interrupted calmly. "There's no evidence linking her to anything yet. Just do the investigation and don't ask questions."

The man on the other end broke into a cold sweat and quickly agreed, not daring to say more.

Meanwhile...

Christina dragged her exhausted body back home.

As soon as she opened the door, she was greeted by Thora's smiling face.

"Ms. White."

Christina forced a smile, trying hard not to think about Thora and William.

"Christina, what's wrong?"

Thora looked at Christina's tired face and the worry etched in her brow.

Thora felt a surge of satisfaction but maintained a concerned expression.

"You look exhausted. Is the studio work overwhelming you?"

"It's nothing," Christina shook her head and glanced towards Harper's bedroom.

"Where's Harper?"

"Harper's already asleep. She ate well, and I took her for a walk in the garden before putting her to bed."

Christina nodded and let out a small sigh of relief.

If there was one thing that could still comfort her, it was Harper's safety.

Even though the child hadn't fully regained her memory and treated her like a stranger, as long as Harper was alive, there was hope.

She just had to be patient and not rush things.

Seeing Christina sit back on the couch, Thora seized the opportunity to sit beside her, looking genuinely concerned.

"Ms. Windsor, if it's okay, can I call you Christina?"

Seeing Thora's sincere expression, Christina pushed aside her doubts and nodded.

"Of course. I thought we were already friends."

Thora smiled and took Christina's hand warmly.

"Seeing you so tired these days makes me feel uneasy."

"After all, I only need to take care of Harper at home. I feel like I'm causing you trouble."

"Honestly, I know a bit about design. If you need help, just let me know. I don't want to feel like I'm freeloading."

Christina felt a warmth in her heart and nodded.

"Thank you. The studio issues should be resolved soon. If you want to help, I'll find a suitable position for you."

Thora's smile faltered for a moment but quickly returned. She nodded.

"Great. I just want to help. After what happened at the party, I feel so guilty."

Thora looked troubled and guilty.

For some reason, Christina felt a bit irritated but shook her head.

"It's not your fault. Just take care of Harper. I won't dwell on it."

After reassuring Thora, Christina dragged her tired body to the study.

She sat at her desk, staring at the design drafts.

Suddenly, Christina's eyes widened as she remembered what had flashed through her mind earlier.

The design draft!

She had designed it herself, and it had never been released. It had always been in her study.

But now, an identical, aged-looking design had appeared online, causing a stir.

Christina couldn't believe it was a coincidence.

Someone had taken her design and posted it online to sabotage the studio.

But who could it be?

Christina couldn't figure it out. She trusted everyone at home.

Unable to make sense of it, she decided to stop thinking about it.

She had a solution, and she would find out who was behind it eventually.

As the night grew darker, Christina thought of William.

She wondered if he was still nearby, working.

Realizing she was thinking about him, Christina frowned and shook her head.

Why was she thinking about him?

They had no relationship anymore. He just needed to take care of Harper and fulfill his duties.

Pushing the thoughts away, Christina was about to go to bed when the door opened.

William was back.

Their eyes met, but before William could speak, Christina looked away and went to her bedroom.

William watched her leave, feeling dejected.

Did he blame Christina for not trusting him?

No, he didn't.

He had been a jerk before. Anyone else would have done the same.

It was his own fault.

With a bitter smile, William decided to wait for the investigation results to prove his innocence.

As for rebuilding trust, that would take time.

He had to be patient.

###chapter 297 Harper Will Definitely Remember

The next morning, Christina was up bright and early.

She remembered how Harper used to love her cooking. If she made breakfast today, maybe Harper would remember the past.

Christina wasn't willing to miss any opportunity. She was ready to do anything to help Harper remember her.

But as she walked into the kitchen, she glanced out the window and saw something that made her heart ache.

In the backyard, Thora was holding Harper's hand. Whatever Thora was saying made Harper smile sweetly.

Then Harper wrapped her arms around Thora's arm, acting all cute and affectionate.

Thora just shook her head with a helpless smile and gently patted Harper's hair.

The scene was so harmonious and warm that it made Christina's eyes sting and her heart ache.

Harper was her daughter, yet she treated another woman like her mother.

The smiles that used to be just for Christina were now for someone else.

It would be a lie to say she didn't care at all.

"Christina, don't worry. Harper will remember."

William's voice came from the kitchen doorway.

Seeing Christina's sad expression, he couldn't help but feel sorry for her and walked over to comfort her.

As William approached, Christina quickly masked her sadness with a cold expression.

"Of course."

She said it coldly, not wanting to talk to William any further.

She went back to her work.

William felt a pang in his heart but pushed his own feelings aside and stepped forward to help.

Seeing Christina glance at him, he quickly explained.

"I'm Harper's dad, after all. She used to love the porridge I made. I'm just helping out so she can remember everything sooner."

Hearing this, Christina looked away and continued her work without saying anything.

Seeing her accept his help, William sighed in relief and worked even faster.

They both focused on their tasks, not saying a word, but the atmosphere was tense.

Meanwhile, in the backyard, Thora held Harper's hand, listening to her childish chatter while glancing at the kitchen.

Through the window, she could clearly see William and Christina cooking side by side.

Even though they weren't talking, the scene looked unusually harmonious, and a flash of malice crossed Thora's eyes.

So, they were showing off their love on purpose!

With everything happening outside, they could still act all lovey-dovey!

Thora couldn't stand it and clenched her hand tightly.

She had brought Harper to the backyard early in the morning, hoping Christina would see them and feel hurt, which would make Thora happy.

But before she could achieve her goal, she saw William helping Christina cook!

How could Thora tolerate this?

"Mommy, it hurts!"

Harper's pained cry snapped Thora back to reality. She realized she had been gripping Harper's hand too tightly, making it red.

Suppressing her annoyance, Thora forced a smile at Harper.

"Sorry, Harper. Mommy didn't mean to. I just saw your dad with Ms. Windsor, and it made me upset."

Even though Harper was young and had lost her memory, she had been brainwashed to believe Thora was her mother.

Hearing Thora's words, Harper looked towards the kitchen and saw her dad with Christina.

The scene looked very harmonious.

Harper immediately got angry and, before Thora could say anything, she huffed, "Mommy, Daddy should be with you. Ms. Windsor has no right to take Daddy away. I don't want Daddy to leave us!"

Thora was delighted by Harper's reaction and couldn't help but smirk.

See? With just a little manipulation, William and Christina's beloved daughter was about to turn against them!

If she couldn't have something, no one else could either!

"Harper, you shouldn't say that."

Thora pretended to be upset, shaking her head and tearing up.

"She's your real mom. It's normal for your dad to be with her."

"I'm not your mom. You can't say that. If Ms. Windsor hears, she'll be mad."

"No way!"

Harper clung to Thora's arm, her eyes welling up with tears. "Mommy, don't you want Harper anymore? I'll be good. Please don't leave me..."

Seeing Harper's tears, Thora panicked. If Harper kept crying, Christina and William would notice.

Thora wanted to pinch Harper's arm out of frustration but held back. She hugged Harper and softly comforted her.

"Mommy would never leave Harper. Don't cry anymore, or I really might leave."

Hearing this, Harper quickly stopped sobbing, looking both sad and determined.

"Mommy, don't be mad. I won't cry anymore. I'll be good."

Seeing Harper stop crying, Thora sighed in relief.

Kids were such a hassle, always crying!

If Harper hadn't stopped, it would have been trouble if William and Christina noticed.

"But Daddy still likes Ms. Windsor, and she's your real mom. Even if you like me, you have to be with your real mom."

Hearing this, Harper got anxious but remembered not to cry. She stubbornly held Thora's hand.

"I don't care. Daddy should be with Mommy. If Ms. Windsor tries to take Daddy, I won't forgive her!"

"That's my good girl."

Thora smiled, satisfied, and hugged Harper.

She was about to say more when she saw the nanny, Clea, approaching.

Thora quickly hid her smug smile and greeted Clea.

###chapter 298 Injustice in the Heart

"Up so early, Clea?"

Thora's face softened into a gentle smile. Clea nodded, not thinking much of it.

"Yeah, Ms. White. I just got up and saw you taking Miss Cavendish for a walk in the backyard."

Clea's gaze fell lovingly on Harper.

"Ms. White, you're so good to Miss Cavendish. Getting some fresh air in the morning is great for kids."

Thora smiled modestly, her lips pressed together.

"I just think it's not good for kids to sleep in too late. Harper went to bed early last night, so I thought I'd take her for a walk in the garden."

Clea casually agreed, watching Harper cling to Thora, clearly dependent on her. She couldn't help but feel emotional.

Harper used to rely on no one but Christina.

But after everything that happened, Harper not only forgot everyone but also started seeing another woman as her mother, relying on and caring for her deeply.

It was truly bittersweet.

But then again...

Watching Thora speak so gently to Harper, Clea sighed helplessly.

Everyone in the apartment knew Thora was incredibly kind to Harper.

Yet Christina had asked Clea to keep a close eye on Thora, to ensure her affection for Harper was genuine.

Clea was puzzled.

Their relationship was so good; it was obvious Thora genuinely cared for Harper.

What was there to watch?

But regardless of her thoughts, Clea was employed by Christina and William.

She had to follow their instructions.

Not thinking much more, Clea turned her attention back to her own tasks.

Unbeknownst to everyone, Thora held Harper's hand, ensuring no one was around before turning to Harper.

"Harper, it's almost time for breakfast. Your dad and Ms. Windsor made it together, so you need to eat it nicely, okay?"

Harper's face fell instantly, unhappy.

"I don't like Ms. Windsor being with Dad. I don't want to eat her food. She'll definitely take Dad away!"

Thora smiled with satisfaction but gently persuaded Harper.

"Harper, Ms. Windsor won't take Dad away. No one can take away your mom and dad."

Harper nodded firmly, gripping Thora's hand tightly.

"Don't worry, Mom. I'll help you get rid of that bad woman!"

Thora stroked Harper's hair, a flash of malice and triumph in her eyes where Harper couldn't see.

Just wait. She would reclaim everything that belonged to her!

Soon, breakfast was ready. When Thora led Harper into the living room, Christina immediately spotted Harper.

"Harper, come eat."

Christina tried to make her expression gentle, smiling.

But Harper pouted, glaring at Christina angrily.

"I don't want to eat your food. You're trying to take Dad away. Go away, I hate you!"

With that, Harper stepped forward, pushing Christina aside and shielding Thora behind her, her face full of vigilance.

"I won't let you bully my mom. If you try to take Dad away, I'll make sure Mom gets justice!"

The sudden change left Christina stunned.

She watched her beloved daughter confront her, favoring another woman.

She could endure it.

After all, Harper had lost her memory; everything had to be taken slowly.

But Harper's eyes, filled with dislike and hatred, mostly anger, were hard for Christina to accept.

Her eyes reddened, and she instinctively stepped back, feeling a deep sense of grievance.

William quickly stepped forward, supporting Christina.

"Christina, don't rush. We need to handle this slowly."

He then looked at Harper, not sparing a glance for Thora.

"Harper, who taught you to say that?"

"No one taught me!"

Harper pouted angrily, seeing William holding Christina's hand. She stepped forward, pulling William's hand away from Christina's arm.

"Dad, I don't want you to be with Ms. Windsor. She's a bad woman, trying to take you away from Mom!"

William felt uncomfortable but didn't scold Harper. He glanced at Thora, his eyes filled with suspicion.

"Ms. White, everything was fine yesterday. What's going on with Harper today?"

Though William didn't say much, Thora could feel his doubt.

She bit her lip, looking helpless.

"I don't know. Everything was fine when she went to bed, and she seemed normal this morning. But just now..."

Thora looked sadly at Christina.

"Ms. Windsor, I didn't teach Harper anything bad. I'm really sorry for what happened. I'm truly sorry!"

Seeing Thora's genuine sadness and guilt, Christina had her doubts but couldn't think much.

Being hated by her daughter made her heart ache, leaving no room for other thoughts.

"It's okay."

Christina sniffed, forcing back her tears.

She managed a smile at Harper, who looked at her with caution, afraid she might hurt Thora. Christina lowered her voice.

"Harper, I don't want to take your mom or dad away."

Christina's voice was strained.

"If you think I'm trying to take your mom and dad away, I'm sorry. Okay?"

Thora and Harper were both taken aback by the sudden apology.

Harper looked confused, not expecting this.

But since Christina apologized, Harper blinked and reluctantly agreed.

"Okay, as long as you don't take my mom and dad away, I won't hate you."

"But you have to apologize to my mom first. If she forgives you, then I will too."

###chapter 299 Farce

Harper's sudden outburst made Christina's heart ache even more, but she forced a smile at Thora to avoid upsetting her daughter.

"I'm really sorry, Ms. White. I didn't see this coming today. Hope we didn't bother you too much."

Thora felt a surge of satisfaction at Christina's apology, but she didn't show it. Instead, she waved her hand dismissively.

"Ms. Windsor, this isn't your fault. I must've done something wrong to make Harper act out like this."

"I think my being here is just making things harder for your family. Maybe I should leave. Harper might adjust to you better if I'm not around."

With that, Thora turned to leave.

Seeing Thora about to go, Harper panicked and rushed forward, clinging to Thora's legs.

"Mom, don't go! You can't leave me!"

"It's all Ms. Windsor's fault! If it weren't for her, you wouldn't be leaving me!"

"If you have to go, take me with you. I don't want to stay here at all!"

Harper's cries were heart-wrenching, as if Thora would disappear from her world any second.

Thora's lips curled into a smug smile as she turned her back to the others. She had no intention of leaving. This was all an act for Christina and William.

She wanted them to see their beloved daughter clinging to someone they didn't respect.

If she left, how could she continue to watch Christina's breakdown and enjoy the drama that would unfold?

Turning back, Thora saw Harper nearly fainting from crying. She gently held Harper in her arms, then looked apologetically at William and Christina.

"I'm sorry, Mr. Cavendish, Ms. Windsor. Harper's reaction is normal. You should take her away. She'll probably calm down after I leave."

"No, I don't want that!"

Harper quickly broke free from Thora's embrace and pushed against Christina's legs.

"You're the bad woman trying to take me away from my mom and steal my dad!"

"Go away! I never want to see you again!"

Christina's heart broke at her daughter's rejection. She wiped away her tears and forced a smile at Thora, though it looked more like a grimace.

"Harper needs you the most right now, Ms. White. Please stay. We need to take things slowly and not upset Harper any further."

Thora felt triumphant but stepped forward and gently held Harper.

"Harper, Mom's not leaving. Please stop crying, okay?"

"If you keep crying, Mom might really leave."

Harper immediately stopped crying but continued to sob quietly.

"I won't cry. Harper won't cry. Just don't leave me, Mom."

Harper's sobs shattered Christina's heart. She couldn't approach Harper, as any step closer made Harper cling to Thora even more, her eyes filled with distrust.

This was the hardest part, but Christina had to endure it.

"Okay, Harper. Mom won't leave you."

Thora smiled warmly, her face full of affection. Harper stopped crying at Thora's words, making Christina feel even worse.

She looked at William, who understood her unspoken plea. Despite their separation, their long-standing connection allowed him to grasp her meaning.

Harper wasn't entirely rejecting him, so he might be the key to breaking through.

William stepped forward, crouching to Harper's eye level.

"Harper, how about Dad joins you for breakfast?"

Harper's tear-streaked face lit up, and she nodded seriously, a smile breaking through.

"Okay, but Dad has to sit with Mom."

William nodded, not sparing Thora a glance. He let Harper lead him to the table, sitting beside her.

Harper looked at them and shook her head.

"No, I want Dad and Mom to sit together!"

She looked at William, her face full of hurt.

"Dad, if you don't sit with Mom, I'll think you don't like her and want to be with Ms. Windsor."

William sighed. Normally, he wouldn't indulge such behavior, but Harper was his daughter, and the doctor had warned against upsetting her.

Reluctantly, he switched seats to sit next to Thora.

Seeing her parents together, Harper finally smiled.

She then noticed Christina standing awkwardly and hesitated.

"Even though you're mean, you apologized to me and Mom. If you want to join us, you can sit down."

Despite Harper's amnesia, her politeness touched Christina. She forced a smile.

"Okay, let's eat together."

With Christina seated, the morning's drama finally wound down.

Harper happily served food to William and Thora, occasionally remembering Christina.

Christina's heart ached, but she hid her feelings, not wanting to upset Harper.

After breakfast, William had to leave for work. Christina, with fewer obligations, planned to check on her studio but saw Harper clinging to Thora, begging for attention.

###chapter 300 Still Have Doubts

"Mom, can you take me to preschool today?"

Thora had been the one taking Harper to preschool these past few days. But a couple of days ago, Thora had promised Christina that Christina could spend two days with Harper. So for the last two days, Christina had arranged for a nanny to take Harper to school.

Today, Harper thought she would be taken to preschool by the nanny again and looked at Thora with a hint of reluctance in her eyes.

Thora smiled helplessly, her face full of love. "Sure, I'll take you to school today."

Harper nodded vigorously, her face lighting up with a joyful smile.

Watching Harper and Thora disappear from her sight, Christina felt a sharp pain in her heart, an unbearable sadness. William saw everything and felt even more heartbroken.

"Christina, don't worry. Everything will get better eventually."

William tried to comfort her, but to Christina, his words felt empty and powerless. Anyone can offer comforting words, but making them come true is incredibly difficult. So Christina forced a smile, wanting to say something but finding herself at a loss for words.

What could she say? Her daughter didn't recognize her and even spoke harshly to her. This was something that would have been impossible in the past, but now it was happening right in front of her.

"There's something strange going on here. I'll help you figure it out and see if we can find anything unusual."

Seeing Christina remain silent, William sighed softly. After saying this, he stepped forward, trying to take Christina's hand. Christina stepped aside, just missing William's outstretched hand.

Not touching Christina and seeing her cold, distant expression, William felt a sharp pain in his heart and could only force a smile.

"You're not feeling well right now. If you don't want to see me, I'll go to the office. When you feel like seeing me, I'll come back to be with you."

William could see that Christina's emotions were unstable and she didn't want anyone around her. Given what had happened between him and Thora, he was probably the last person Christina wanted to see right now.

After taking a deep look at Christina, William finally turned and left.

Once the living room was empty, Christina covered her face with her hands, silently shedding tears. She could do without William, and the issues at the studio could be resolved slowly. But if Harper never remembered her, Christina would truly fall apart.

Harper was all she had left. If anything happened to Harper, Christina couldn't imagine how she would cope. She didn't know how long she stayed like that, maybe it felt like an eternity, or perhaps just a moment.

Christina wiped away her tears, making sure there were no traces of crying on her face, then left the living room, heading towards the studio. As she opened the apartment door, she saw Clea walking towards her from the garden.

Seeing Clea reminded Christina of the task she had given her earlier. As Clea approached, she greeted Christina with a warm smile.

"Ms. Windsor, I've been keeping an eye on the matter you asked me to handle," Clea said enthusiastically. "Don't worry, Ms. White doesn't seem like a bad person. Every time I pass by them, Ms. White is always very kind to Miss Cavendish. And Ms. White is very considerate. Whether Miss Cavendish recognizes you as her mom or not, she won't be mistreated by Ms. White."

Listening to Clea's words, Christina opened her mouth, unsure of what to say. Clea seemed quite satisfied with Thora. Clea was known to be picky, so if she praised Thora, it meant Thora was indeed good to Harper. But after hearing this, Christina felt even more confused. She couldn't pinpoint why, but something felt off. However, she couldn't say exactly what was wrong.

"Alright," Christina smiled, then reminded Clea, "Please keep an eye on Ms. White for me. It's not that I don't trust her, but since Harper doesn't like me right now, I want to understand what Harper has been doing these days so I can address the issue."

Clea, being just a servant, naturally wouldn't question Christina's arrangements and requests. She agreed readily, "Don't worry, Ms. Windsor. I'll keep you informed of any developments!"

After seeing Clea off, Christina was about to head to the studio when she received a call from her assistant, Zachary.

"Ms. Windsor, our plans are almost ready. The photo evidence is very clear. When should we release the clarification online?"

Christina could hear the excitement and enthusiasm in Zachary's voice, and her previously saddened heart felt a bit better with this good news.

"Have we found a suitable authoritative institution in the industry?" she asked, pointing out the most crucial aspect. Zachary hesitated.

"Sorry, Ms. Windsor. The partners we've worked with before, especially the more authoritative ones, said they need to think about it."

Although Zachary phrased it politely, Christina instantly understood the meaning. They said they needed to think about it, but they really didn't want to get involved. Even with the evidence, these reputable studios didn't want to be dragged into the mess. Even if it could bring them attention, they wouldn't easily take on such matters.

"Ms. Windsor, they're so frustrating!" Not hearing a response from Christina for a while, Zachary felt awkward and quickly tried to lighten the mood. "They don't appreciate how great our studio is! But it's okay. We can release the news ourselves and still get attention without them!"

Listening to Zachary, Christina raised an eyebrow. She had anticipated that no partners would help. But hearing the news still surprised her. However, it wasn't a big deal.

"It's okay," Christina quickly regained her composure, walking forward while rapidly considering alternative plans.

###chapter 301 Continuing the Investigation

"Alright, I'm heading to the studio now."

Christina spoke calmly, "Whatever's going on, we'll figure it out together when I get there."

With Christina's reassurance, everyone seemed to relax a bit.

Zachary let out a sigh of relief. "Okay, Ms. Windsor, drive safe. We're all waiting for you!"

Christina nodded, hung up the phone, and quickly drove towards the studio.

Meanwhile, William had just arrived at the company and was greeted with some good news.

"Mr. Cavendish, about Mrs. Cavendish's situation, a studio is willing to step in and prove that it's all false, just a smear campaign to discredit competitors."

William raised an eyebrow, not surprised at all. The Cavendish family had started this mess, and with William's influence, many were eager to help, hoping to stay in his good graces.

"Alright, I get it."

William nodded, his expression turning serious. "What have we found out about that woman, Thora, and what happened at the party?"

His assistant looked a bit uneasy but, recalling the investigation results, braced himself to answer.

"Sorry, Mr. Cavendish, maybe I'm just not good enough. About Thora, all I know is she had a tough life, got pregnant by accident, but then had a miscarriage."

"As for anything else, there's nothing suspicious worth noting."

William frowned, feeling something was off. The more they couldn't find anything, the more he felt there was something strange. Though Thora's background seemed insignificant, the lack of any suspicious details made William more convinced there was an issue.

He frowned, thought for a while, and finally asked, "Have we figured out what happened at the party?"

Talking about the party made William's expression even colder. Someone had dared to target him at his own event and succeeded! No matter who was behind this, if left unchecked, it could further damage his relationship with Christina! This person was definitely trying to sow discord. To reconcile with Christina, he had to find this person quickly!

Having gathered enough information, William raised his chin slightly, pondered for a moment, and then calmly instructed, "Proceed with the plan. First, let the reputable design agency release evidence proving Christina was falsely accused and smeared."

"With a credible design agency backing it, many should be convinced."

"As for Thora..."

Mentioning Thora, William's face turned icy, his voice cold enough to freeze. "Keep a close watch on Thora. Don't miss any clues, got it?"

The assistant wiped the sweat from his forehead, ignoring the intense pressure, and quickly nodded. "Yes, Mr. Cavendish, I understand."

Watching his assistant leave, William finally looked away. But the lack of progress in the investigation made him increasingly frustrated. Could his suspicions be wrong? Was Thora really innocent, and he was just paranoid from past experiences? For the first time, William doubted his own judgment.

Meanwhile, the assistant followed William's instructions and soon contacted the design agency. Within just ten minutes, a reputable design studio posted a clarification online. The content strongly supported Christina, proving she hadn't plagiarized. They even vouched for it with their own reputation, calling out the smear campaign as malicious competition. They urged everyone to reject such unethical practices.

The well-organized statement quickly gained tens of thousands of views and continued to rise. The evidence was solid, proving Christina's innocence from start to finish. To ensure authenticity, the statement included their credentials for verification. With the situation reaching this point, no one doubted its truth.

Those who had previously insulted Christina now apologized loudly.

"I can't believe it was all fake, malicious competition. I was wrong!"

"Yeah, I thought Christina was a thief, but turns out I was the fool, used as a pawn!"

"Sorry, Christina!"

"Before knowing the truth, we shouldn't jump to conclusions. Christina was unfairly slandered and insulted, truly innocent!"

"Agreed. I never commented because I wanted to see how it unfolded. Christina's studio has always been innovative, never similar to others. How could she plagiarize?"

Online discussions confirmed Christina's innocence.

Christina had just arrived at her office when her assistant informed her that their statement was rejected by the reputable design studio. But another company was willing to provide proof. Christina, relieved by the good news, was about to relax. However, Zachary excitedly approached her, almost incoherent with his words.

###chapter 302 Crisis Averted

"Ms. Windsor, you gotta check the front page right now!"

Zachary was practically bouncing with excitement, while Christina was still trying to catch up with what was happening.

Skeptical, she picked up her phone. Before she could even open the app to check the headlines, a notification popped up on her screen.

The notification was directly related to her studio. It detailed, in an orderly fashion, that Christina's studio was not guilty of plagiarism and provided comprehensive evidence to prove her innocence.

Though the article wasn't lengthy, it was thorough and well-supported with evidence. From every angle, it strongly demonstrated that Christina's studio was a top-notch content creator with a spotless record.

With this evidence, the narrative quickly shifted in her favor. If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, she wouldn't have believed that an authoritative source had already cleared her name.

This was far more effective than anything she could have done on her own.

Christina felt a wave of gratitude but was puzzled as to why this authoritative source had helped her. This studio was a giant in the design industry, one she hadn't even considered approaching when she had Zachary reach out to potential partners.

She never imagined they would step in to help. Yet, here they were, like a scene out of a fantasy, leaving Christina both surprised and confused.

Why would someone help her? Especially when Zachary had contacted so many design studios, all of which had refused to assist.

However, as Christina was still mulling over this, Zachary, brimming with excitement, said, "Ms. Windsor, with this studio's help, things will be much easier for us moving forward!"

"I can't believe someone helped us out like this. It's amazing!"

Hearing Zachary's words, Christina suddenly thought of William. If anyone could have pulled this off, it would be him. No one else came to mind.

The possibility made Christina's expression darken. She hadn't intended to ask William for help, yet he had quietly paved the way for her without saying a word.

If this had been the old her, she would have been overwhelmed with gratitude. But now, as she looked at the article gaining traction online, clearing her studio's name, she felt conflicted.

She didn't want to owe William another favor. If this continued, their relationship would become even more entangled.

Taking a deep breath, Christina picked up her phone and dialed William's number. But just as the call connected, she quickly hung up.

What was the point? William had already helped her, and he owed her from their past. He should be repaying her now.

Christina kept telling herself this, but William had already seen the missed call and immediately called her back.

Seeing his name on the screen, Christina felt a wave of frustration. She knew he would call back. Why had she called him in the first place?

Annoyed, she ignored the call, but William was persistent. He didn't hang up until the call went to voicemail. Then, a message notification appeared.

Christina glanced at her phone and saw a short, simple message: "Christina, don't feel any pressure. Just consider this my way of repaying you. Accept it as my compensation."

Christina's mind was in turmoil, but she didn't have the energy to deal with her personal feelings. With the media battle underway, she needed to focus on her studio and clear their name completely.

"Zachary, with this studio paving the way, let's stick to our original plan. Once our studio is back on track, I'll give everyone an extra month's bonus!"

Zachary's excitement was palpable. "Ms. Windsor, you're the best!"

He quickly spread the good news, and the team, seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, threw themselves into their work with renewed vigor.

Meanwhile, at the kindergarten entrance, Thora knelt down to Harper, who looked reluctant to part.

"Harper, Mommy isn't leaving you. I just have a lot of work today," Thora said, forcing a gentle smile. "So, Ms. Windsor will pick you up after school, okay?"

Seeing Harper's unhappy face, Thora quickly added, "Don't worry, Mommy isn't abandoning you. I just need to work to make money. Be good, okay? Ms. Windsor will bring you to me soon."

Harper, though unhappy, pouted and nodded reluctantly. "Okay, Mommy. Harper will be good and won't make you angry."

After saying goodbye, Harper entered the kindergarten, and Thora's lips curled into a barely noticeable smile.

If Harper already disliked Christina, she would fan the flames. She would make sure the fire burned so brightly that Christina would have no way out.

This was the fate William and Christina deserved.

With that thought, Thora turned to leave, only to receive a call. It was Casey.

"Ms. Spencer, someone's started digging into your background. Be careful."

###chapter 303 Meeting

Thora thought she had prepared so thoroughly that failure was impossible.

But she hadn't expected William and Christina to uncover her plan, and Harper suddenly regained her memory, indicating the brainwashing experiment had failed. If she hadn't reacted quickly, she might not have been able to escape.

Not long after she got out, Thora thought of Casey.

Her current situation had a lot to do with him.

Although she wasn't completely out of options, she didn't want to let William and Christina off the hook, so she dialed Casey's number.

"Hey, Jennifer? What's up? Thought you were busy with your plans."

"Cut the crap. I'm not Jennifer anymore. I changed my name to Thora, remember?"

"Alright, alright. Where are you now?" Thora couldn't stand Casey's teasing over the phone.

"Okay, don't get mad. I'll send you my location."

Thora hailed a cab and headed to the location Casey sent.

Casey was already waiting at the door. The moment he saw Thora's face, he felt a bit dazed.

Honestly, in his mind, Thora still looked like Jennifer.

He liked Jennifer from before, even though she was a bit arrogant, disorganized, and didn't care about much. To him, she was incredibly cute.

"Why are you staring at me? You helped design this face, didn't you?"

Thora got out of the car and saw Casey looking at her face with a hint of sadness.

She immediately threw her belongings into Casey's arms, feeling annoyed.

"Yeah, yeah, you're right. But why are you looking for me now?"

If Casey remembered correctly, Thora had prepared so much to go after Christina and William.

But it seemed like nothing had happened to them?

"Haven't you seen the news online? I don't even want to explain it to you. Let's go."

Thora walked ahead, and Casey carried her things to his place.

"So, what's your plan now?"

Talking about plans made Thora grit her teeth in anger.

If her last plan hadn't failed, she wouldn't have had to come to him for advice.

But even so, Thora wasn't willing to let it go.

"Of course, but I'm hungry. Make me something to eat."

He nodded quickly, put her things on the couch, and went to the kitchen to prepare some food.

He made her a meal and brought it out.

After Thora had eaten enough, she relaxed and started sharing her thoughts.

"I think they've become more cunning recently, so I need your help."

Casey looked at her with some confusion.

He handed her a glass of water.

"Here, have some water."

She took the water from his hand and looked at Casey with frustration.

"What's wrong? Are you unwilling to help me? You know you're the only one who can help me now."

He shook his head.

"I didn't say I wouldn't help you. It's just that it's difficult. If you've already changed your face and identity, and they can still recognize you, then..."

"I've hidden well. It's not that I've been discovered; they're just too vigilant. No matter what identity I use, they seem to sense it."

To Thora, this was a very bad situation.

In other circumstances, she might consider it more carefully, but now she couldn't wait.

She was eager to see them punished.

As for Casey's suggestions, Thora hadn't considered them.

"Your previous ideas were good, but too complicated to implement. Think of something more practical. I'm not planning to go out for a while, so I'll stay at your place. Is that okay?"

Thora still had that arrogant demeanor.

Casey smiled faintly at her words.

"Why wouldn't it be okay? Even though your face isn't the same, you're still the same person, and you haven't changed much."

He wanted to say she was still as arrogant as before, still unwilling to let others off easily.

But he had fallen into this trap, and some things were hard to describe.

"Glad you understand."

Before they could say more, Casey's phone rang.

"Yes? I understand. I'll handle it here. Just follow the usual procedures."

He hadn't hung up yet when he noticed Thora's curious gaze.

He quickly wrapped up the call.

"What's up?"

"I'm curious. With your abilities, couldn't you do better? Why are you so low-key about these things?"

He smiled faintly at her question.

"Maybe it's because of certain things and certain people. But don't worry, since I said I'd help you, I'll do my best. If we're going to go after them, we need to understand the current situation first."

"Got it. Stop nagging."

Meanwhile, Christina had just signed a contract and was rubbing her temples in exhaustion.

She had thought it wouldn't go smoothly, but the partner was surprisingly agreeable.

"Ms. Windsor, based on their requirements, we can start by sketching the design and then create a prototype. If that's okay, I'll get started." Her assistant came in to ask about the next steps after receiving the contract.

"Alright, start with the sketches and then make a prototype. Make sure it's detailed."

She couldn't take the partner's easygoing nature for granted.

"Got it. I'll take care of it."

The assistant went out to gather the relevant team members for a meeting.

Christina looked for potential collaborators.

Their studio was now on the right track and gaining some recognition. With proper development, they could grow significantly.

Just then, her phone rang.

"Should I pick up the kids today?" William's gentle voice came through.

After everything that had happened, their relationship had eased a bit.

But to Christina, it was all superficial.

She never thought she would end up like this with William.

But some things had to be handled with surface-level politeness. Christina checked her schedule for the day.

"Go ahead. I might be a bit late getting off work. Tell Harper I'll bring her something tasty tonight."

After saying this, Christina was about to hang up.

William quickly interrupted.

"Wait, what time will you be home tonight? What do you want to eat? I'll have the nanny make it or buy it in advance."

"No need."

She hung up before he could respond.

William looked at his phone with a sense of melancholy.

Even though he had tried so hard, the damage was done, and changing things seemed difficult. But he wouldn't give up. Whether big or small, he would keep trying.

###chapter 304 First Signs

After hanging up the phone, Christina should have dived back into her work.

But she stared at the documents in her hand for a long time without absorbing any of it.

Feeling a bit agitated, Christina was about to call her assistant in to discuss some details of the draft.

Her phone rang again.

Assuming it was William, she answered without looking, her tone a bit impatient.

"I told you, it's not necessary. Just take care of yourself."

But as soon as she finished speaking, a slightly teasing voice came through the phone, "Whoa, what's got our Ms. Windsor all riled up?"

"Ah..."

Christina instinctively let out a sound and then looked at her phone, realizing it wasn't William calling, but Stefan Hensley, the new business partner she had just signed a contract with.

"Haha, did someone upset Ms. Windsor? I actually have some contract details to discuss with you. Do you have time?" Stefan smoothly changed the topic.

"Yeah, I do." Christina had been trying to distract herself from those thoughts anyway.

Her call with William had only lasted a short while.

For some reason, though, Christina couldn't stop replaying those moments in her mind, making it hard to focus.

"Great. I'm downstairs at your office. Why don't you come down, and we can discuss it over lunch?"

"What?"

Christina was surprised. She looked out the window and indeed saw a flashy sports car parked below.

Seeing this, Christina couldn't help but recall the beginning of her collaboration with Stefan.

Back then, Christina didn't have any big deals and had heard about Stefan's temperament from a friend.

He had inherited his parents' company but had innovative ideas that took the company to new heights.

Christina decided to take a chance, and to her surprise, he was unexpectedly pleasant.

Not only did she not have to drink a single glass of wine, but she also didn't face any sarcasm or inappropriate looks. They signed the contract directly.

This stark contrast left a deep impression on Christina.

"What's wrong? Is it not convenient?" Stefan asked politely when she didn't respond for a while.

"No, it's fine. But I should be the one treating you to lunch." Christina quickly gathered her thoughts and replied.

"Oh, come on. It doesn't matter who treats whom. Since it's convenient, come on down. I'll be waiting."

"Alright, I'll be right there." Christina hung up, got up, and tidied herself up a bit before heading out.

She bumped into her assistant at the door, who was coming to discuss the next steps of the project.

"You go ahead and start the meeting. I'll discuss some follow-up details with our partner. If you have any questions, post them in the group chat, and I'll respond when I can."

"Got it."

When Christina got downstairs, Stefan was already out of the car. He had a sunny disposition and was dressed casually, leaning against the car door with a smile that was almost blinding.

"Mr. Hensley, you're too kind."

Seeing him waiting, Christina hurried over.

He smiled and opened the passenger door for her.

"Don't mention it. I was just passing by and thought we could discuss some details. No need to feel pressured."

His emotional intelligence was off the charts. He immediately sensed Christina's discomfort and reassured her.

"Well, I feel bad about it. You pick the place, and I'll treat."

"You can't refuse, or I'll really feel bad."

Honestly, Stefan was the most agreeable business partner Christina had ever worked with.

He was extremely gentlemanly and spoke kindly.

Though he seemed a bit unreliable on the surface, he was organized and smart.

Working with someone like him meant they could achieve their goals without beating around the bush.

This was exactly what Christina hoped for. Stefan just smiled lightly in response.

"Don't worry about it. It doesn't matter who treats whom. Let's go."

After buckling his seatbelt and driving a bit, he asked, "Do you have any dietary restrictions? Or anything specific you'd like to eat?"

Christina looked at him anxiously.

"Aren't I supposed to be the one asking that? And then I decide?"

"Oh, come on. It's all the same. I'm more familiar with the area. Just tell me."

"I don't have any dietary restrictions. Since it's lunchtime, we can just grab something. If you don't have any restrictions either, I'll just pick a place."

"Alright, no problem."

When they arrived at the restaurant, Christina realized that Stefan's idea of "just picking a place" was a restaurant that only accepted fewer than 50 reservations a day.

"Mr. Hensley, you're too kind. I thought I was supposed to choose. This is quite extravagant."

"Enough with the formalities. The owner is a friend of mine. Let's go."

A waiter greeted them at the door.

They weren't seated in the main dining area but in a private room upstairs.

The room was small, only accommodating four or five people.

With just the two of them, it didn't feel too spacious.

"The usual set, please."

The waiter, familiar with Stefan, began setting the table.

"Sure."

Before the food arrived, Christina adjusted her mood and started discussing work details.

In casual conversation, Stefan was warm and a bit playful.

But when it came to work, he was serious and had specific requirements.

"Although the design is good, I think it's too generic. Since it's a personal brand, it should have some unique features."

"I understand your design concept, but this is our company. I think we should add a bit more to it."

Christina nodded at his words.

"Alright, we'll do it your way."

"However, after signing the contract, I already drafted some sketches and had a meeting to revise them. You can take a look at the general idea."

Christina pulled up the sketches on her phone and handed it over.

She expected Stefan to take the phone, but he leaned in close to look at it.

Their proximity made Christina a bit uncomfortable.

But Stefan didn't seem to notice and continued pointing out details.

"This cuff here, I think it could be raised a bit to make the arm look longer. Everything else is great. I really appreciate your design."

After looking, he started to pull back, but their heads almost bumped as Christina was about to respond.

The moment became awkward.

Just as Christina was wondering if she should say something to break the tension, the waiter knocked and announced that the food was ready, easing the situation.

"Let's eat first. We can discuss more after."

Stefan awkwardly rubbed his nose.

###chapter 305 Scandal Spread

"Alright."

Christina had never been in a situation like this before, but she didn't dwell on it.

After finishing their meal, they continued discussing other details.

"How about we go somewhere else?"

Normally, after a meal, they would part ways. But Stefan showed no signs of wanting to leave or send her off.

Christina had noticed several calls coming in for Stefan earlier. Out of politeness, he didn't answer them, but she saw his furrowed brows as he glanced at the numbers, which seemed odd.

"Mr. Hensley, maybe we should reschedule. I'd like to go back and refine the design. I'll send the updated plans to your account later."

Christina thought this would be a polite way to decline, but Stefan waved it off nonchalantly.

"No rush. Your company is already pretty quick. The last studio I worked with promised a two-week turnaround, but in the final days, they said there were still many details to revise, dragging it out forever."

"Your efficiency is impressive. Take your time. We have over a month for the project, right?"

He finished with a gentle smile at Christina.

Despite feeling comfortable around Stefan, Christina never forgot their professional relationship. She maintained a respectful distance, but Stefan didn't seem to mind.

Seeing Christina silent for a while, Stefan chuckled awkwardly and spoke up.

"Looks like I'm different from you workaholics. Since you want to get back to work, I'll drive you back. We can go out another time."

"Alright, thank you, Mr. Hensley."

Christina didn't refuse. It wasn't until she returned to the office and saw his follow-up message that she felt a bit uneasy.

Stefan was indeed easy to work with, the most agreeable client she had ever encountered. But he was almost too gentlemanly.

"Mom, when are you coming home? Harper's already back!"

Christina's phone rang, snapping her out of her thoughts. Harper's voice came through the line.

Since regaining her memory, Harper felt guilty and clung to Christina more. Though still young and naive, she knew she had upset her mom before and wanted to talk to her more.

"I'll be home soon."

"Mom, can I have some mini tarts... please?"

"Of course, no problem."

"Thank you, Mom. Love you."

Christina's voice softened as she spoke to Harper.

She tidied up a bit and told everyone to head home for the day. Then she drove to buy Harper's favorite treats before heading home.

When she arrived, Harper was drawing, the nanny was cooking, and William was working in the corner of the living room. It felt quite cozy.

Christina rubbed her temples and put on a gentle smile.

Harper looked up at the sound of the door opening, dropped her pen, and ran over.

"Mom, you're finally home. I missed you so much."

Christina picked her up and sat on the couch.

"I missed you too. I bought you some mini tarts, but you can only have one, okay? We need to have dinner soon."

"Okay, Mom."

Harper took the mini tart and kissed Christina's cheek.

William paused his typing when Christina came home, even considering getting up, but Christina sat on the other side of the room with Harper. He noticed her deliberate distancing.

A hint of sadness flashed in his eyes, but he quickly composed himself, putting on a warm expression and sitting next to Christina.

"Do you want anything special? I can ask the nanny to make it."

"No, thanks. I ate with a client. You all enjoy."

Christina was gentle with Harper but couldn't be calm and collected with William.

"Alright, I understand."

Due to various reasons, Harper knew William was her dad. In her mind, parents should live together. Christina had been living alone with Harper, but Harper's request made the already awkward situation with William even more complicated.

William, however, saw this as a positive change.

"Excuse me, I need to take a call."

In the tense atmosphere, William's phone rang, and he went to the study to answer it.

"Mom, did Dad make you upset? Why are you so harsh with him?"

Christina looked at Harper's puzzled eyes, feeling exhausted. She couldn't explain the past life issues to her daughter. Their problems were more than just past life matters.

"No, Dad didn't make me angry. I'm just tired from work today. It's my fault. I'm sorry."

"Okay, then I'll go for a walk with you later."

Their mother-daughter interaction was heartwarming.

After dinner, Christina took Harper for a walk and then helped her with her bedtime routine. During this time, she barely interacted with William.

Once Harper was in bed, Christina was about to get back to work when William blocked her path.

"Can we talk?"

His tone was somewhat pleading.

"About what?"

"I don't think it's necessary."

Though Harper wanted them to live together, Christina felt William had manipulated the situation. But as long as Harper was healthy and happy, Christina didn't mind the awkwardness.

"I just think we don't need to be so cold, whether in front of Harper or not." William's voice was tinged with sadness as he watched Christina turn away.

"What do you want me to do?" Christina asked calmly, looking back at him.

The conversation ended in failure again.

"I'll try to adjust and not show it in front of Harper, but some things are hard to ignore."

Christina couldn't forget the pain William had caused, even if it was from a past life. The torment felt real.

"Alright, I understand."

William didn't push further and went back to the study.

The next day, after dropping Harper off at school, Christina headed to the studio. As she parked, she noticed a familiar figure standing outside, holding something.

As she approached, she realized it was Stefan.

"Mr. Hensley, what brings you here? Passing by or checking on the project details?"

Christina greeted him with a smile, but when she saw what he was holding, she suddenly stopped.

###chapter 306 Pursuit

"Here you go."

Stefan handed the bouquet to Christina without saying a word.

Christina was caught off guard and instinctively took the flowers.

When she realized what was happening, she looked up, puzzled.

"Mr. Hensley, what's this about?"

Stefan spoke earnestly.

"I know this might seem a bit out of the blue, but after I went home last night, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I decided I needed to tell you how I feel."

"I want to pursue you. I hope you'll give me a chance."

Christina was stunned, and the flowers slipped from her arms.

"Mr. Hensley, what are you talking about?"

"Pursue me? Aren't we just business partners?"

Christina thought everyone in their circle knew her situation. She was married and had a child, which was why she hadn't divorced William yet. It saved her a lot of trouble, and her child needed a stable family. Otherwise, she would have divorced William long ago.

Stefan smiled at her response.

"I know, but you know, feelings can't be controlled. You're really attractive, so I..."

Seeing he was about to say something even more outrageous, Christina quickly interrupted.

"Hold on, why don't we go inside and talk?"

Stefan shook his head.

"If we go to your office, we'll end up talking about work. Don't worry, even though I'm pursuing you, I can separate business from personal matters. I won't mix the two."

"I was drawn to you first, then your abilities. I can distinguish between the two."

Christina felt even more helpless.

"I know this might make you uncomfortable. I'm just letting you know, hoping you'll give me a chance."

"As for work, I'll send someone to coordinate with you later to avoid any confusion."

Christina felt a headache coming on.

"Mr. Hensley, I think you might not fully understand my situation. I'm already married and have a child, so..."

Christina thought she had made herself clear.

But Stefan waved his hand dismissively.

"I don't mind. I know you and William aren't happy together, so I hope you'll give me a chance. If I can make you feel secure, then you can consider divorce, okay?"

His gentle attitude left her speechless.

Christina was frozen in place.

"Maybe I scared you. Sorry, you go ahead and get busy. I'll leave now."

Seeing Christina's lack of response, he quickly turned around, got into his sports car, and drove off.

But many people working in the same building had witnessed the scene.

Although they didn't catch all the details, they were more interested in the gossip than the actual content.

By the time Christina snapped out of it, all she saw was the car's exhaust.

She picked up the flowers from the ground and took them back to the office.

"Ms. Windsor, you..."

Her assistant noticed the flowers in Christina's arms as she walked in.

"Are you decorating the office?"

"Sure, you can distribute them to everyone and put them on their desks."

Christina handed the flowers to her assistant and went into her office.

She quickly typed a message on her phone and sent it to Stefan.

"Mr. Hensley, I know you're a gentleman, but please don't joke like this. My reputation in the industry isn't great, but I assure you, I won't slack off at work."

She was about to send more when he replied.

"So what? I think you're wonderful. Please don't doubt my taste."

Christina was even more at a loss.

Since Stefan expressed his feelings, his actions became more obvious.

He openly sent takeout to Christina's studio employees and often showed up at her office around closing time.

"Sorry, regardless of my relationship with William, I think this is inappropriate. I hope you won't do this anymore, or our collaboration might be difficult."

He sighed.

"I thought my actions would show you my sincerity, but it seems I've misjudged. Don't worry, I'll keep trying."

Christina sighed.

"I don't know how to explain, but we can't be together. And I won't divorce William."

Christina added silently, at least for now.

For her child's well-being, she couldn't make such a rash decision.

"I just hope you'll give me a chance. If this makes you uncomfortable or is inappropriate, it's my fault."

He handed her another gift.

But this time, her luck ran out.

Thora had been planning for a while and finally came up with a strategy: send reporters to stake out and see if there was any scandal involving Christina.

Coincidentally, the reporters caught Stefan expressing his feelings to Christina.

They took photos from various angles.

The next day, Christina saw the scandal trending online.

The headline was explosive, accusing Christina of publicly betraying her relationship.

The article included photos of Christina and Stefan, causing an uproar online.

"Oh my God, how can Christina be so ungrateful? She has such a good husband and still thinks about betraying him."

"Even though the guy she's betraying him with is great, I have to say, what's with his taste? Why go for a married woman?"

"Hey, you can't just dismiss someone because you don't like them."

"But betraying a relationship is really bad, and I haven't seen William and Christina on the same page."

The scandal spread to several business partners.

"Ms. Windsor, I know you're not that kind of person, but I think you should control the narrative a bit. We're still collaborating, and I don't want our product to suffer."

The partner was very tactful.

Christina felt a headache coming on and rubbed her temples.

"Don't worry, I'll handle it. You don't need to worry."

"Okay, I trust you, Ms. Windsor. Let's leave it at that."

She had just hung up with one partner when several others called with similar concerns.

Christina was very frustrated but had no choice.

William had just returned from a business trip abroad and saw Bob's troubled expression. He was puzzled.

###chapter 307 Clarifying Rumors

"What's up?" he asked, putting his stuff away.

"Mr. Cavendish, maybe you should check your phone?" Bob was still a bit torn.

He had wanted to ask William what he thought about the situation, but he realized William hadn't even noticed what was happening online.

William put his things down, sat in his office chair, and finally opened his phone. After seeing the trending news, his brows furrowed deeply. Then, he looked up and gave instructions.

"Handle the PR and clear things up. I'll address it personally afterward."

His words left Bob stunned. He had thought William knew about the situation and would at least question it a bit, like asking who Stefan was or how he and Christina had interacted. But to his surprise, William didn't hesitate at all and just told him to clear things up.

"What's wrong? Didn't you hear me?"

"Got it, I'll get right on it."

After Bob left, William put down his phone and rubbed his temples. But when he opened his eyes again, they had regained their usual sternness. He trusted Christina; he believed she wouldn't do such a thing.

He then called Christina. Christina had just finished explaining things to several partners when she saw William's call, her eyes full of exhaustion.

"Are you calling to question me too?" she asked, her tone not exactly friendly.

"No, I want you to join me in clearing things up. I trust your character."

His words made Christina want to retort, but the harsh words got stuck in her throat.

"Alright, when?" Christina asked after a long pause, trying to keep her tone calm.

"I'll arrange it. Once everything is set, my assistant will notify you."

There was a long silence afterward.

"I'm serious. I don't doubt you, and it's not that I didn't address it immediately. I just got off the plane."

His explanation left Christina a bit dazed.

"I understand. Thank you."

Christina hung up the phone, only for Stefan to call next. This time, Christina felt truly helpless.

"Mr. Hensley, please don't add to my troubles."

"Sorry, this is my fault. I'll clarify things online and hope people stop attacking you."

Stefan didn't understand either. He was the one who had feelings first, so why was Christina bearing the brunt of it?

Hearing his words, Christina quickly responded.

"Please stop. I've already told you there's no possibility between us. I would never do something unethical, so please don't make things worse."

"But I really want to be with you. I genuinely like you."

Christina sighed in frustration.

"But I've told you, I'm married and have a child."

"I said I don't mind. I hope you can give me a chance."

The two argued over the phone. After he said that, Christina fell silent. She wondered what chance he was talking about. Hadn't she made herself clear enough?

"Alright, Mr. Hensley, I've said all I need to. I hope you can restrain yourself a bit."

Christina's tone turned cold, ready to cancel their collaboration. Just then, Bob's call came in. Christina hung up on Stefan and turned to discuss the clarification with Bob.

"Okay, I understand. I'll head over now."

William had already set up a press conference. When Christina arrived, he was ready. The exhaustion on his face had vanished. Seeing Christina, William walked over with a warm smile. They had agreed long ago to play the role of a loving couple in public. It was beneficial for both William's company and Christina's studio. Christina didn't want any complications either. To her, it was an act, but William saw it as genuine.

"You're here. Are you cold? Need a jacket?"

Christina shook her head. "No, I'm good."

Once the two main characters arrived, the media swarmed in.

"Thank you all for coming to this press conference. Regarding the false rumors online, we've got our lawyers on it. As for the claims about my wife betraying our relationship, that's completely untrue. Christina and I have a great relationship, and our family is very close."

William stated the facts and held Christina's hand. Christina nodded, her expression still somewhat cold, but her demeanor softened when their fingers intertwined.

"Thank you all for your concern, but I'm not interested in betraying my relationship. My husband is wonderful, and my child is adorable. I would never do such a thing."

As soon as Christina and William finished speaking, the media started asking sharp questions.

"Even if Stefan is younger and more talented than William, you don't feel tempted?"

"Are you just playing the role of a loving couple to shut the media up?"

"Stefan's abilities are on par with William's. Haven't you considered..."

Seeing the media's questions becoming more pointed, William reached out and removed the microphone from Christina's face.

"Everyone, if you want to ask questions, please keep your distance. Your microphones are practically poking my wife's face."

Christina coldly gripped William's hand.

"Liking someone doesn't require excessive explanation. Not liking someone means no matter how great they are, they're useless in my eyes. Are you encouraging me to betray my relationship with these questions? Or are you trying to ruin my family?"

Christina's words shifted the topic, leaving the media who asked sharp questions a bit embarrassed. Because of this clarification, many netizens sided with William and Christina.

"I think those rumors were pretty ridiculous. Could it be that Stefan was just pestering Christina? She's married with a husband and child. Honestly, if she were to betray her relationship, she'd do it discreetly, not in front of the company."

"I think you're right."

Due to the rumors, Christina's company unexpectedly received more orders. Despite this, Christina still wanted to end her collaboration with Stefan.

"There's no need to be so absolute. Liking someone isn't a crime. If I had met you before William, I would definitely be with you."

Seeing him persist, Christina quickly explained.

"Mr. Hensley, you might have misunderstood. I'm not saying the company isn't clear-cut. I just think our current relationship isn't suitable for collaboration. If you're willing to have someone else from the company take over, I'd still be happy to work with you."

"As for the relationship issue, I think you're a very gentlemanly and worthy partner, but it's not possible between us."

Christina made her point clear. He sighed and pretended to be strong.

"You're right. Some things can't be forced. I respect your decision. I didn't win your heart, but I don't want to lose you as a collaborator."

And with that, the matter was settled.

###chapter 308 Two Mothers

Although the situation had finally settled, Stefan felt the need to make a statement, seemingly to clear things up for Christina.

"Hey everyone, there's been a lot of negative stuff about Ms. Windsor floating around online lately."

"Based on all that, I want to set the record straight. All those claims are bogus. It was my own actions that caused trouble for Ms. Windsor."

"Ms. Windsor has turned me down many times. It was my own thoughtlessness that ended up impacting her so much. I'm really sorry to everyone and especially to Ms. Windsor."

"Sorry for taking up your time. I hope you all won't hold any more grudges against Ms. Windsor. I won't bother her anymore. I wish her all the best and happiness in the future."

It was a brief statement, but it quickly sparked a lot of reactions online.

"I knew Christina wasn't like that. Finally, the truth is out."

"So it was Stefan's relentless pursuit that caused Christina so much trouble. I apologize for my previous harsh judgments about Christina."

"Sorry, Christina. I misunderstood you and even affected your studio."

"Honestly, you can only believe half of what you see online. Didn't this situation just flip today?"

In short, the internet was flooded with comments supporting Christina, all apologizing to her.

This buzz continued for several days before it started to die down.

However, the effect on Christina's studio was significant.

The biggest impact was that Christina's studio received more and more collaboration invitations. The front desk was constantly busy handling various contracts.

The receptionists were overwhelmed, and everyone was busy every day.

Those partners who had planned to withdraw their collaborations were the first to continue their partnerships, and many new collaborations were added as a result.

The studio employees were overjoyed. Although they were working non-stop, the bonuses they received were also higher.

Even Christina spent less time with Harper, spending most of her time at the studio.

This made Harper quite unhappy, but she never showed it in front of Christina.

After all, in Harper's understanding, her mom was very busy to earn money and provide a better life for her.

However...

Harper's memory was still a bit confused. She always felt like she had two moms.

But the features of the other mom were somewhat blurry, making it hard for her to remember clearly.

In her memory, she seemed to have always spoken harshly to her current mom, Christina, saying many hurtful things.

She didn't know how her mom managed to get through that time and still didn't give up on her.

Thinking about this made Harper feel even more sorry for Christina.

She behaved even more obediently every day, never causing Christina any extra trouble.

This made Christina feel both comforted and increasingly guilty towards Harper.

A child who is so understanding must have gone through a lot.

Christina couldn't quite grasp how Thora managed to make Harper trust her so completely during that time.

But thankfully, Harper was slowly regaining her memory.

Even though her memory was still a bit fuzzy, it was better than nothing.

"Harper, eat up."

Christina said, thoughtfully serving her a bowl of soup.

"Thanks, Mom."

Harper smiled sweetly and glanced at Christina.

"Mom, you should eat more too. You've been so tired lately, you can't afford to lose weight."

Then, Harper turned her gaze to William.

"And Dad, you should eat more too. You've been working too hard."

Seeing Harper act like a little adult, reminding both him and Christina, William couldn't help but laugh.

"Alright, Dad and Mom will listen to you and eat more."

God knows how much William had longed for such a warm scene.

Now that it had finally reappeared because of Harper, he cherished it deeply.

Thinking this, his gaze naturally fell on Christina, filled with tenderness.

Christina's hand holding the spoon paused slightly, then she nonchalantly looked away and continued eating.

She wasn't unaware of William's gaze.

His gaze was too intense, almost making her lose her composure in front of him.

But she couldn't.

Christina just couldn't let go of everything and be with him again.

If it weren't for Harper, she wouldn't even want to be under the same roof as William.

Sighing silently, William knew that everything had to come slowly.

What happened in the past was hard for even him to let go of, let alone Christina. How could he expect her to let go of her resentment and be with him?

"Harper, after breakfast, how about Dad takes you to school?"

Unable to solve the current issue, William decided not to think about it.

When he looked at Harper, his face was filled with warmth and affection.

"Okay!"

Harper's eyes lit up, and she nodded happily.

Then she cautiously looked at them and asked, "Is Dad busy today?"

William was taken aback, seeing the cautiousness on Harper's face that had never been there before, he felt a pang of heartache.

"Dad's not busy. Dad won't be busy for the next few days. I can take you to and from school every day."

Only after hearing this did the cautiousness on Harper's face disappear, replaced by relief and happiness.

"That's great!"

Harper cheered, but then she pouted.

"Mom and Dad have been so busy lately. It's always been Clea taking me to and from school."

She pouted slightly, her face full of grievance.

Feeling a surge of guilt and heartache, William couldn't help but gently stroke Harper's hair.

"Don't worry, Harper. Dad won't be busy anymore. Dad will take you to and from school every day, okay?"

Harper didn't immediately agree. Instead, she hesitated and looked at him expectantly.

"Really?"

William felt another pang of heartache, seeing Harper's increasingly cautious expression. Without thinking, he nodded.

###chapter 309: Great Impact

"Of course, sweetie. I'm your dad, it's my job to take you to and from school."

William paused for a moment, then smiled at Christina.

"Mom's been really busy lately, but once things settle down, both Mom and Dad will take you to school together. How does that sound?"

With William's promise, Harper finally nodded confidently, her face lighting up with a big smile.

"Okay!"

After breakfast, Christina watched as William took Harper to school. She had to admit, she felt a little moved by the scene at the table earlier.

But it was just a fleeting feeling. No matter what happened in the past, at least in this life, William was a great father to their daughter.

Even so, she couldn't completely let go of the past. Harper was so cautious now, always afraid of making Christina and William angry. This wasn't like the Harper she used to know.

It must have been the incident with Thora that hurt Harper. Even if there was no physical harm, the emotional impact was significant.

Christina knew she couldn't ignore this any longer. After finishing her work today, she needed to take Harper to the hospital to figure out what was going on.

At the studio, Christina dove into her work as usual. Their studio was gaining more and more recognition, attracting clients who admired their unique design concepts and wanted to collaborate.

Some of Christina's past designs had also resurfaced, drawing attention for their innovative and bold ideas. Online discussions about her work were buzzing, creating quite a stir.

"Ms. Windsor, you're becoming quite famous online!" Zachary said with a hint of envy. "Our studio is thriving thanks to you. We wouldn't have so many projects without your reputation."

Christina just smiled faintly. All her hard work and dedication to design were finally paying off. While her ultimate dream hadn't fully materialized, she had achieved more than she ever imagined, and that made her happy.

Her satisfaction fueled her determination to keep pushing forward. However, the busier she got, the more William worried about her, wishing she would take it easy and rest more.

But every time he saw her cold, indifferent expression, he felt he had no right to interfere. He could only watch her work tirelessly, feeling both anxious and concerned.

One day, William seized an opportunity. After dropping Harper off at preschool, he found Christina working from home instead of the studio. He stood in front of her, casting a shadow over her workspace.

Christina frowned slightly and looked up. "William, do you need something?"

Seeing it was William, she gave him a blank look. "I have work to do. If there's nothing important, please don't disturb me."

"Christina..." William's heart ached. "You've been so busy lately. You haven't had much time for me... or Harper. Maybe you could take a day or two off to spend more time with Harper. She needs you."

Christina glanced at him, ready to dismiss him like she used to when he spoke harshly to her. But she realized she hadn't spent much time with Harper lately. William had been taking care of her, and Harper missed her mother's presence.

Her expression softened slightly, though she still kept a stern face. "I understand. I'll make time for Harper. But don't expect anything more."

William had anticipated her response, so he wasn't disappointed. He was just grateful she was willing to talk to him at all.

Nodding, he wanted to say more, but seeing her already engrossed in her work, he held back and turned to leave.

"Wait."

Christina's voice stopped him. He turned back, a hopeful smile on his face. "Christina, is there something else?"

She hesitated, knowing Harper's biggest wish was for her parents to spend time together. Reluctantly, she said, "If you're free this afternoon, let's take Harper to the hospital after picking her up."

William immediately understood. Nodding, his face showed concern. "Yes, Harper's been acting strange lately. A check-up might help us understand how to help her."

Thinking about Thora and the impact she had on Harper made William's expression harden. But when he looked at Christina, his face softened with a warm smile.

"I'll meet you at Harper's preschool this afternoon."

Imagining Harper's joy at seeing both her parents together, William couldn't help but smile. At least Christina was willing to spend more time with them.

As he left, Christina's lips curved into a small, unnoticed smile. But she quickly returned to her usual stoic expression.

William was William, and Harper was Harper. She couldn't mix the two.

###chapter 310 Affection

If it weren't for the fact that Harper needed a father figure right now, and William's current behavior was temporarily satisfactory to her, Christina wouldn't have even considered living under the same roof with him, let alone allowing Harper to spend more time with him.

But no matter how much she thought about it, she couldn't explain the events of the past life to Harper. Harper was still so young; how could she understand such complicated matters?

Even though she was reluctant, Christina was willing to do anything to make Harper happy. She sighed silently at the thought.

The most pressing issue now was Harper. Because of Thora, Harper's psychological state had changed significantly. Christina needed to figure out what was going on to address it properly.

Thinking about Harper's previously lively and happy demeanor, and comparing it to her current cautiousness, afraid that Christina and William might abandon her, Christina felt a pang of heartache, mixed with regret and guilt.

If she had discovered Thora's true nature earlier and realized that Thora was only using Harper to get close to William, she would have taken Harper away from William and Thora much sooner. Now, Harper's personality had already been affected, and Christina could only try to mitigate the damage.

With these thoughts in mind, Christina let out a long breath, losing the motivation to work. But she forced herself to stay calm and focused until she finished her day's work. Only then did she stand up under William's expectant gaze.

"Christina, are you done?" William asked cautiously as he saw her stand up.

Christina nodded, grabbing her bag from the desk without even looking at him. "Yeah, let's go."

Though it was just a few simple words, it was enough to make William happy. "Great, I'll go get the car!" He smiled excitedly and hurried to the underground garage.

By the time Christina stood at the front door, William had already pulled up in front of her. As soon as she got in the car, William instinctively reached over to fasten her seatbelt, but Christina pulled away.

"No need, I can do it myself."

William's instinctive gesture made Christina pause for a moment, and she couldn't help but scoff internally. In their past life, William's heart had been entirely with Jennifer. He had done countless outrageous things for her. This instinctive gesture was probably a leftover habit from his time with Jennifer. If such a small act could move her, it would be too cheap a sentiment.

"No, I can do it myself." Christina avoided William's hand, fastened her seatbelt on her own, and glanced at him. "Let's go."

William's smile faltered, feeling hurt and regretting his overstepping. He could only offer an apologetic smile. "Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you."

As he spoke, William quickly turned his attention back to driving, missing the surprised expression on Christina's face. In this new life, William had changed in many ways. Things she never thought she'd see in him before were now evident. But remembering the past, she could only smirk cynically. Only after losing something do people learn to cherish it. But what was the point of such a loss? If you never lose it, you'll never learn to cherish it.

With these thoughts, the car soon arrived at the preschool. They both got out at the same time, joining the throng of parents picking up their children. It was rare to see a father accompanying his wife to pick up their child, and their striking looks made them the center of attention.

When Harper emerged from the preschool, she immediately spotted her parents waiting for her and jumped up in excitement. Her face lit up with joy. These days, it had always been her dad picking her up, and she only saw her mom during breakfast because of her busy work schedule. Seeing her mom today was a delightful surprise for Harper.

"That's my mom and dad!" Harper proudly introduced her parents to her friends, waving her little hand at them. "Mommy, Daddy, I'm here!"

Hearing Harper's proud voice, Christina couldn't help but chuckle. They both looked up instinctively, seeing Harper happily skipping towards them after saying goodbye to her teacher. Seeing Harper so happy, Christina's face softened into a gentle smile. She crouched down slightly, and Harper, under the envious gazes of her friends, ran into her arms.

"Harper," Christina said softly, stroking Harper's hair. "Did you listen to your teacher today? Were you a good girl?"

Harper nodded vigorously, her smile sweet. "Don't worry, Mommy. I listened to the teacher and was a good girl. I didn't argue with my friends!"

Seeing Harper's proud expression, Christina couldn't help but laugh, taking her hand and standing up. "Thank you, Ms. Zhang, for taking care of Harper these past few days. I've been so busy that I haven't had time to look after her."

Ms. Zhang smiled. "Ms. Windsor, you're too kind. Your husband has been very diligent, picking Harper up every day and bringing treats for the kids. Harper's classmates are all envious of her. Your husband must treat you very well too. You two are such a loving couple, even after all these years. We all admire you."

Christina felt a bit awkward hearing the teacher's words. She glanced at William instinctively. William stepped forward gracefully, gently taking Christina's hand. "Thank you, Ms. Zhang. It's my duty."

William's smile was polite and his tone respectful. Christina felt his warm, dry hand gently holding hers. She suppressed the urge to pull away, letting him hold her hand, feeling extremely uncomfortable but enduring it.
