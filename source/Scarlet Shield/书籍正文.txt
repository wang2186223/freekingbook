**********+


On a quiet morning bus, the sleepy crowd was jolted awake by a sudden scream.

Everyone turned to see a slightly overweight guy in his forties pinned to the ground by a young woman in her early twenties using some kind of grappling move.

Next to them was another young woman in a white blouse and pencil skirt, looking pale and clutching her bag tightly.

"Who the hell are you? Let go! Let go of me now!" The man on the ground cursed, muttering non-stop.

Zoey Brown pressed down harder on his arm, making him scream again. "Stealing and still mouthing off? Try cursing one more time, jerk!"

The man scowled. "Which eye of yours saw me stealing?"

"Both!" Zoey shot back without missing a beat, glancing at the frightened young woman beside her. "Call the cops."

The girl flinched, clutching her bag even tighter. "Forget it, I... I didn't lose anything."

She was rushing to work; thieves usually worked in groups. If she got into trouble, she wouldn't be able to handle it alone.

Seeing the hesitation in the girl's eyes, Zoey raised an eyebrow and gave her a cold, disdainful look.

Just then, the bus arrived at a stop. As the back door opened, the man took advantage of Zoey's distraction and bolted off the bus! He quickly blended into the crowd and disappeared in no time!

Zoey squinted in the direction the man had escaped.

Then she disdainfully clapped her hands and looked at the young woman, saying, "Idiot!"

The words were particularly clear and crisp on the quiet morning bus.

Seeing the passengers' eyes on her, the young woman's face turned red in an instant!

Zoey didn't look at her again and got off the bus leisurely.

Encountering an idiot first thing in the morning put Zoey in a bad mood. She grabbed a quick breakfast from a street vendor and ate it as she walked into the police station. John Williams, the officer guiding and training her during her internship, and her fellow intern, Emma Thomas, were nowhere to be seen.

Emma's bag was on the table. Zoey couldn't recall the brand name, but she knew it was designer.

Zoey glanced at it, then sat down at her desk, biting into her bread and turning on her computer.

Mark Jones hurried in with some documents; he saw Zoey sitting alone at her workstation, typing while eating bread.

Then he grabbed Joseph Miller, who was passing by. He asked, "What's going on? Did John leave Zoey alone again?"

Joseph rubbed his nose. "Not exactly. It's really Zoey's own issue."

Mark asked, "What do you mean?"

Joseph replied, "Every time Zoey and John went on a mission together, John got chewed out. He was about to get a promotion, but because of her, he got a disciplinary action, and now it's hopeless. Who could tolerate that?"

Mark had been busy with an interstate human trafficking case recently and wasn't clear on the details. He asked, "What happened? How is John's disciplinary action related to Zoey? Zoey is a top graduate from the police academy. Even if she's a bit impulsive, she wouldn't cause John to get a disciplinary action, right?"

Joseph shook his head and replied, "I don't know the specifics. I just know that John took Zoey to handle a domestic violence case. When they arrived, the man was still hitting the woman. Guess what happened?"

Mark said without hesitation, "In such cases, it's usually about mediation. John should have stepped in to stop the man, but didn't manage to?"

Joseph shook his head. "I heard Zoey went up and kicked the man flying."

Mark was silent. Zoey was a bit impulsive!

Even if the man was in the wrong, Zoey, as a police officer, couldn't just use force!

Mark asked, "Didn't John try to stop her?"

Joseph said, "With Zoey's skills, even if John wanted to stop her, he couldn't. The key issue was that the woman who called the cops was still screaming for help when she saw John and Zoey. But when she saw Zoey hit her husband, she freaked out, screaming, 'How can you hit my husband?' and tried to fight Zoey!"

Mark was speechless. The complainant was also frustrating. "And then?" He asked.

Joseph shrugged. "Then Zoey stopped hitting the man and started scolding the woman. Then the couple teamed up against Zoey. Zoey did manage to resolve the situation, and the couple reconciled. But they both filed complaints against her. As an intern, the department couldn't do much to her, so John ended up getting punished!"

This situation wasn't entirely Zoey's fault, but it did start because of her.

John having issues with her was understandable! However, it was pitiful that Zoey ended up being isolated like this.

Mark didn't want to gossip about Zoey behind her back. Seeing Zoey idle, he walked over with the documents.

Mark asked, "Zoey, do you have a moment?"

Besides her internship at the police station, Zoey also had a side gig writing novels online. But she knew how to juggle her priorities.

Zoey had just finished updating a ###chapter and swallowed the last bite of her bread. She turned to Mark, "Hey, Officer Jones, what's up?"

"I've got a case here. If you're free, could you give me a favor?" Mark asked.

Since she had nothing else on her plate, Zoey nodded. "Sure, what's the case?"

"A suspected surveillance case," Mark said, pulling out the chair next to her. "A young single woman living alone reported three days ago that someone was watching her. We did a covert investigation around her place but found no suspicious individuals. We thought she might be overthinking due to work stress."

He continued, "But she called me again today, still feeling like someone is watching her. I figured, since you're both women, it might be easier for her to open up to you. Maybe you could figure out if she's hiding something or if we missed any details."

After explaining, Mark looked at Zoey, a bit apprehensive.

Zoey wasn't under his supervision, so this was more of a temporary assignment. Plus, the case was likely a misunderstanding on the girl's part, so this trip might yield no results.

After all, the girl was ordinary-looking, from a regular family, and worked at a small company. There wasn't much worth watching.

But the girl had asked for help, and as a police officer, he couldn't ignore it.

However, his current case had just made some progress, and he couldn't spare the time.

Since people at the station said Zoey had a peculiar personality, he was indeed a bit unsure about her attitude toward this.

Fortunately, after listening, Zoey crumpled the napkin she used to wipe her mouth and tossed it into the trash can. She said, "Alright, Officer Jones, send me the complainant's details."

"Sure!" Mark took out his phone and sent the complainant's number to Zoey. "She's still at work now. Go after she gets off. I'll inform John, so you don't have to worry."

"Okay!" Zoey didn't say much, turned around, and called to set up a time with the complainant.

She got off work at five. The complainant's apartment complex was about a forty-minute drive from the station. She planned to write two more ###chapters if she had nothing to do in the afternoon.

After lunch, Zoey was still napping when John and Emma returned.

John was called into a meeting as soon as he arrived.

Emma returned to her desk alone and saw Zoey sleeping on the table. She sat down and started shouting, "Zoey is truly fortunate, able to stay in an air-conditioned office during this scorching weather. Unlike me, running around with Officer Williams every day, getting sunburned!"

Emma's voice was naturally sharp, and when she spoke in a high-pitched tone, it was even sharper. Zoey was woken up by the noise and lifted her eyelids to look at her.

Zoey had big eyes with large pupils, and when she stared at someone expressionlessly, it was quite intimidating.

Emma shrank back under her gaze. "Did I wake you? Sorry!"

Zoey stared at Emma carefully. "Indeed, your skin looks very rough."

Emma was instantly infuriated!

Zoey had naturally good skin, with no visible pores or acne.

Zoey had been out on assignments with John recently and hadn't gotten sunburned, which drove Emma crazy with jealousy.

Emma ground her teeth, "I can't compare to you. I'm just destined to work hard, unlike you..."

Emma didn't finish her sentence, but it was more hurtful than if she did.

Zoey stared at her again and slowly said, "I was born lucky, unlike you!"

Emma fell silent.

She didn't want to talk to Zoey anymore!

Zoey loved peace, but it was Emma who asked for it.

In the afternoon, Zoey finished organizing the materials John had given her, wrote two more chapters, and when the time was right, she got up to pack her things.

Emma glanced at the time in the bottom right corner of her computer and called out, "Zoey, it's not time to get off work yet. Where are you going?"

Zoey gave her a blank look and said, "On a call."

"On a call?" Emma wanted to ask more, but Zoey had already turned around with her bag, leaving Emma with just the back of her head.

Since Zoey kept causing trouble, John hadn't taken her on any assignments. What call could she be going on?

She was puzzled when John, their supervising officer, returned from his meeting.

Emma immediately went over, pretending to ask casually, "Officer Williams, Zoey said she was going on a call. Did you give her a case to investigate?"

John took a sip of coffee, "Not me, Officer Jones did. It's not a big case, just some preliminary investigation work."

Preliminary investigation work was tough and tiring. Hearing this, Emma's previously downturned mouth curved into a smile!

###chapter 2

Emma shot a glance at John, who was sipping his coffee. She blinked and tried to sound casual. "What's Zoey even thinking? She ditches our cases to help Officer Jones with basic stuff. People might think you didn't train her right!"

John barely lifted his eyes to look at Emma.

Emma's heart skipped a beat, and she quickly looked away. Realizing she looked guilty, she forced herself to meet John's gaze with a wry smile. "Just saying, Officer Williams."

"We're cops. When the country and the people need us, we follow orders. Pretty sure your instructor drilled that into you on day one," John said, blowing on his coffee, sounding indifferent.

Emma's fingers dug into her palm, and she forced a smile. "Sorry, I misspoke."

"Don't let me hear that again," John said, turning back to the case files.

Behind him, Emma bit her lip, still a bit defiant. "Officer Williams, I'm just worried. Zoey's so reckless, she might mess things up for Officer Jones, and that could come back on you."

John paused, his eyes flickering slightly.

Meanwhile, Zoey was stumbling off the subway.

She was supposed to meet the informant at this subway entrance.

As she exited from Entrance A, she spotted a girl with black-rimmed glasses, clutching a canvas bag, looking around nervously by the escalator.

Zoey walked up to her. "Ella Garcia?"

Ella looked up, nervously adjusting her glasses.

"Are you Officer Brown?" Ella asked, glancing behind Zoey with disappointment. "Didn't Officer Jones come?"

"I'm still an intern," Zoey said bluntly. "Officer Jones is busy, so he sent me to get some info from you first."

Ella clutched her bag straps, looking down in disappointment.

She knew it; no one believed her. Even Mark, as nice as he was, must have found her annoying. Otherwise, he wouldn't have sent this intern Zoey.

Zoey looked at the dejected Ella and frowned. "This isn't the place to talk. Let's find somewhere to sit and chat."

Ella nodded. "Okay."

They found a nearby beverage shop.

After ordering drinks, they sat down. Ella clutched her cup tightly. "Officer Brown, ask whatever you want."

Zoey took out a notebook and pen, looking at her indifferently. "I've read your previous report. In the past week, have you felt like someone is watching you?"

Ella shook her head, looking bitter. "No, but I can't be sure."

Zoey frowned. Police work needed evidence.

Words like "think," "maybe," and "possibly" were the last things they wanted to hear.

Zoey asked, "Then why did you report again, saying you felt someone was watching you?"

Ella was stunned. "It's just a feeling. A few days ago, I didn't feel it, but this morning, as soon as I left the house, it came back."

After she finished, she noticed Zoey, who had been sitting upright, suddenly relaxed, slumping in her chair. Zoey bit on her straw, sipping her drink nonchalantly.

Zoey sensed that Ella's demeanor was fragile, self-effacing, and timid. People like that often hated bothering others.

But Ella kept reporting feeling watched, and besides her intuition, Zoey thought there must be another reason. But Ella was hiding it.

Zoey frowned, deep in thought, and quickly texted Mark.

Zoey: [Officer Jones, can you send me Ella's previous testimony again?]

She needed to go over Ella's statements for any inconsistencies.

Ella felt uneasy. She knew her words sounded shaky.

But she had no other choice. Alone in this city, with no family or friends, she had no one else to turn to but the police.

She was scared Zoey wouldn't believe her and hurriedly said, "Officer Brown, please, everything I said is true."

Zoey looked up, her tone flat. "I believe in solid evidence more than words. Do you have any?"

Ella's breath caught, and she lowered her head. Suddenly, she started crying.

Zoey fell silent.

One of the things Zoey dreaded most was a woman's tears. No matter how unreasonable, they always left her feeling helpless. It was so annoying!

Zoey frowned, casually pulling out two tissues and handing them over.

Comforting people wasn't her thing. Zoey said, "If you don't have any new evidence, should I take you home first?"

Ella knew her words alone made it tough for the police.

Previously, Mark and his team had investigated around her but found nothing, leaving the case unresolved. With so much time passed, her words would only seem less credible.

Ella hung her head, looking weak. "Okay."

Zoey gave her a deep look and walked with her towards her home.

Ella rented an apartment in an old neighborhood with poor security.

In the elevator, Ella couldn't help but ask Zoey curiously, "Are you playing a mobile game?"

Zoey had been glued to her phone the whole way.

Honestly, even though her life was financially tight, her phone was better than Zoey's.

Zoey didn't look up. "No, I'm doing a side job."

"A side job?" Ella was puzzled, "Do police officers need side jobs?"

Zoey replied matter-of-factly, "No choice, I'm broke!"

When the elevator reached Ella's floor and the doors opened, Zoey stepped out.

As soon as she exited the elevator, Zoey's eyes, which had been glued to the screen, suddenly lifted, looking towards the end of the hallway.

For a moment, her indifferent gaze became exceptionally sharp. But it was just a moment before she returned to normal.

"Does your building have surveillance cameras?" Zoey asked casually, her attention back on her phone.

Ella shook her head, feeling a hidden sense of shame. "No, this building is old, and the property management is lax, but it's cheap."

She had only recently graduated, and her income was limited. After covering her basic living expenses, she could only afford to rent a place in such an environment.

Zoey nodded, not saying much. She asked indifferently, "Do you feel like you're being watched now?"

Her sudden question startled Ella.

Ella instinctively glanced at the corner of the hallway, then quickly looked away like a frightened rabbit. She shook her head, her face pale. "No."

Maybe it was because she wasn't alone, even if it was just Zoey, who looked barely out of her teens, she felt a rare sense of security.

"Okay," Zoey responded coldly and went back to tapping on her phone.

After about half a minute, Zoey noticed no movement beside her, then she looked up at Ella in confusion, "Aren't you going to open the door?"

Ella snapped out of it, exclaiming, and quickly ran to her door, pulling out her keys to unlock it.

Just as she opened the door and was about to go in, the door opposite suddenly opened from the inside.

A young, scholarly man appeared at the door, holding a bag of trash.

Seeing Ella, he smiled kindly. "Just got off work?"

"Yes, are you heading out?" Ella visibly panicked, her face turning a suspicious shade of red.

The man nodded. "Yes." His gaze fell on Zoey, who was still engrossed in her phone. "Is this your friend?"

###chapter 3

Ella felt a lump in her throat and glanced at Zoey, not sure how to introduce her.

Should she say she called the cops because she thought someone was stalking her, and this was the officer checking it out? What would he think of her?

Ella's grip on the doorknob tightened instinctively.

Zoey looked up just then, her eyes flicking over the guy's face before she quickly went back to her phone.

"I'm not her friend; I'm just giving her a ride home!" she said honestly, though she left out some details.

And what she left out was exactly what Ella found hard to talk about.

The guy smiled a bit. "Got it, you two chat. I'll go take out the trash!"

With that, he walked past them with the trash bag and headed for the elevator.

Ella watched him go for a while until Zoey's cough snapped her back to reality.

Blushing, she stepped aside. "Officer Brown, please come in! My place is a bit messy; hope you don't mind!"

Zoey said, "Alright."

Before stepping in, Zoey glanced back at the slowly closing elevator doors. Coincidentally, the guy in the elevator was also looking at her. Their eyes met, and he gave her a warm, gentle smile.

Zoey kept a straight face, looked away, and walked into Ella's place.

Ella's rented apartment was a one-bedroom unit, only about 300 square feet.

The decor was simple and elegant, with floral wallpaper that had yellowed at the edges and some scattered brown marks.

Though Ella didn't have much stuff, it almost filled the tiny room. Luckily, she was super organized; despite the cramped space, it was tidy and neat, giving off a pretty nice vibe.

Zoey sat down on the sofa, and Ella poured her a glass of water. As she handed it over, she couldn't help but ask, "Officer Brown, did you notice anything on the way back?"

"No." Mark and the others had already done a thorough check, and they found nothing unusual. What could she possibly uncover on a casual stroll?

Ella lowered her eyes, looking uneasy. "What should I do then? Will you stop helping me because there's nothing unusual?"

"No!" Zoey looked at her, "Since you called the police, I will be responsible for you until your safety is fully confirmed."

Hearing this, Ella felt a bit more at ease.

Unable to find any clues, she remained deeply anxious.

Seeing her like this, Zoey suppressed her irritation and tried to divert her attention. "Think carefully; besides feeling watched, has anything weird happened lately?"

Ella muttered, "Something strange?"

Zoey said, "For example, has anyone asked you for help or directions?"

Ella, momentarily distracted by the question, thought hard before shaking her head. "No, nothing weird. My life is pretty simple-just work and home. I don't have many friends here. Apart from occasionally going downstairs to feed the community's stray cats and dogs, I rarely leave the house once I'm back."

"Feeding stray cats and dogs?" Zoey's eyes flickered. "Did anyone use that as an excuse to talk to you?"

Ella shook her head again.

Zoey nodded. "Alright, since you're home safe, I'll head out. Think back over this time and see if anything weird happened. Hit me up if you remember something."

Ella nodded. "Okay!"

Zoey took the elevator down and saw the guy from across Ella's apartment squatting by the trash can.

A bunch of stray cats were gathered around him, munching on cat food from bowls.

Maybe it was because Zoey's stare was too obvious, the guy turned his head.

Their eyes met. He smiled a bit and stood up. "Heading out already?"

Zoey nodded, glancing at the stray cats and the full bowls of food. "Are there a lot of stray cats and dogs around here?"

The guy smiled shyly, his voice gentle. "There used to be a lot, but lately, there are fewer. Maybe they found somewhere else to go."

Zoey nodded and looked at him. "You're pretty kind-hearted."

The guy smiled bashfully, his eyelashes lowering. "I didn't do much."

"You've done enough," Zoey said with a hint of meaning, then turned and left.

Behind her, the guy's gaze lingered on her as she walked away. The dim streetlight cast a long shadow, making his features hard to see in the darkness.

On her way back, Zoey got a call from Mark.

Mark asked, "How'd it go? Did she say anything?"

Zoey's tone was stiff. "No clues; she said it's just a feeling. I checked out her surroundings, nothing suspicious."

Mark said, "She might just be overly cautious, turning into paranoia. Since there are no clues, come back. Drop this matter."

Zoey agreed.

After taking the subway and bus, Zoey got back to school almost at midnight. Her dorm was empty because her roommates had all moved out due to her crazy behavior.

Zoey enjoyed the peace and casually cooked some pasta. While eating, she uploaded the updates she wrote on her phone to her computer, putting them in the draft box. She had drafted four thousand words today!

After eating, she noticed it was late and decided to sleep. Zoey washed the pot, climbed into bed, and plugged in her phone to charge. Just as she was about to sleep, she heard two vibrations.

She picked up her phone and saw a voice message from the school director, William Harris.

William's voice was full of concern. "Zoey, how's the internship at the police station going?"

Zoey replied: [It's going well.]

William quickly sent another voice message, over forty seconds long. "Good to hear. Keep up the good work. After this month, I'll arrange for you to join the criminal investigation department. I always thought, with your abilities, you're more suited for criminal investigation. But you know, you need to control your temper."

Zoey didn't think she was suited for criminal investigation. On the contrary, she was quite satisfied with her current job.

So she honestly replied to William.

Zoey: [No need, I think this police station suits me well, with good pay and leisure.]

William found it curious. So he sent another voice message. "This place has the most work and the most diverse tasks; how could you possibly be idle?"

Zoey turned over and replied: [I don't know, but I'm quite free.]

William was silent for a while, then his tone turned somber. "Are you being ostracized?"

###chapter 4

Zoey thought back to her time at the office. Was she really being left out? No way!

Just as she was about to reply, William sent another voice message. "I don't think so. With your personality, it's probably you leaving everyone else out!"

Zoey went quiet. What was up with her bad rep?

She yawned, sounding tired. "Mr. Harris, it's late. I gotta go. I have work tomorrow."

William suddenly remembered why he contacted her in the first place and quickly sent another voice message.

"I wanted to tell you that Alexander Edwards got another shoutout from the criminal investigation department. They praised him big time. You two were rivals in college, so you can't let him outshine you during your internship, right? Zoey, you gotta step up your game. Don't embarrass me, okay?"

Hearing Alexander's name, Zoey's mind pictured his chiseled face.

Out of everyone Zoey had seen, no one looked as good as Alexander.

She also remembered when they got their internships, Alexander had looked at her and said, "How could you just be an ordinary cop? You should join me in criminal investigation."

Back then, she thought, 'Who does he think he is, and why should I join him?'

Zoey looked at the ceiling and chuckled softly.

Zoey messaged William back, firmly stating: [Mr. Harris, can you stop bringing him up? We're not even close.]

William quickly sent a voice message. "Yeah, right."

Zoey was speechless, turned off her phone, rolled over, and closed her eyes.

After Ella finished her breakfast, she was about to head to work. As soon as she opened the door, that creepy feeling of being watched came back.

She stood at the entrance, too scared to step outside.

Ella was terrified. With trembling hands, she took out her phone and called Zoey.

Zoey, as usual, strolled into the police station with a piece of bread in her mouth.

Seeing Ella's call, she immediately answered.

Ella's voice was trembling. "Officer Brown, I-I'm really scared."

"What's wrong?" Zoey took a bite of her bread, squinting slightly.

Ella's voice was shaky. "I feel like someone is watching me again, and they're really close."

"Where are you? Do you see anyone suspicious?" Zoey asked.

Ella paused. "I'm at home, in the hallway. There's no one here."

Zoey was silent for a moment.

Ella might be a bit paranoid and unreasonable.

Zoey had taken her home last night, checked everything, and found nothing suspicious before leaving.

But now, early in the morning, Ella called Zoey again, saying these paranoid things. Still, that feeling of being watched was hard to ignore and was torturing her.

Ella said, "I'm sorry, Officer Brown. Maybe I'm just too sensitive. If you don't believe me, forget it. I'll go to work now."

Zoey was silent for a couple of seconds before replying, "If you notice anything, contact me immediately."

Ella hung up the phone, took a deep breath, and forced herself to step out of her home.

She walked cautiously, looking around nervously until she got into the elevator.

Just as she was about to breathe a sigh of relief, a hand suddenly reached out to stop the closing elevator doors!

Startled, she screamed and grabbed her pepper spray from her bag, ready to defend herself.

A refined and handsome young man, taken aback by her reaction, leaned back slightly.

"Sorry, did I scare you?" he asked, looking apologetic.

Seeing it was her neighbor, Ella's heart settled, but the feeling of being watched didn't disappear.

She put the pepper spray back in her bag and awkwardly ran her fingers through her hair. "No, I scared you, didn't I? Sorry, I've been a bit..."

Ella hesitated, unsure if she should say more.

The young man looked concerned. "What's wrong? Did something happen?"

Maybe it was the unfamiliar city, but having someone relatively familiar show concern triggered Ella's desire to confide.

She told him about her suspicions, then shrank into a corner. "Do you think I'm just being overly sensitive and paranoid?"

"No," the man smiled, pushing his glasses up with his middle finger. The light reflecting off the lenses hid his true emotions; his tone was exceptionally gentle. "It's normal for a woman living alone to be cautious."

This was the first time Ella heard someone say she should be cautious.

Previously, when she mentioned her situation to her colleagues, one male colleague even mocked her, saying she wasn't a beauty, so no one would watch her.

Ella felt hurt. She was already insecure and timid. After the incident, she didn't dare to reveal her true feelings at work at all.

"Thank you!" With the man's encouragement, Ella felt much better.

The elevator descended to the first floor. Ella and the man said goodbye and headed to work.

After a busy day, her supervisor suddenly gave her a lot of work, causing Ella to leave work very late.

When she returned to her apartment complex, though she was tired, she still planned to feed the stray cats and dogs as usual.

However, on the quiet path, the food bowls were full, but there were no stray cats in sight.

The evening breeze rustled the leaves, stirring her sensitive nerves in the quiet environment. Ella's heart suddenly raced, and she felt extremely anxious.

Her mind was filled with recent news she had seen online about "missing women living alone" and "psychopathic killers," making her face turn pale with fear.

She instinctively wanted to call Zoey but then remembered Zoey was just an intern cop. Without any suspicious individuals or new evidence, she felt embarrassed to keep bothering Zoey. So, she put her phone back in her bag.

Ella swiftly turned to head home, but as she did, she noticed a hooded figure standing at the end of the path, appearing eerie and sinister under the dim streetlight.

Before she could scream, the person spoke first, "What a coincidence, are you here to feed the cats too?"

It was her neighbor. Ella immediately lowered her guard, and her heart settled.

"Oh, it's you. Are you here to feed them too?" Ella looked back at the empty path. "It's a pity they're not here today. I wonder where they went."

Under the streetlight, the man smiled slightly. "Maybe they were taken back by others, or they went to another complex for food."

###chapter 5

He let out a small sigh and said, "Man, cats are so unpredictable!"

Ella chuckled at his remark, and the creepy feeling of being watched seemed to fade away.

"Want me to walk you back?" he offered, noticing her mood lift.

Ella felt really grateful, her cheeks turning a bit pink, and she nodded shyly, "Sure, thanks!"

They strolled side by side, their shadows stretching out under the streetlight.

Maybe it was the overlapping tree shadows, but one of their shadows looked oddly distorted.

For the next few days, that feeling of being watched didn't go away, but Ella wasn't as freaked out as before.

Every day after work, that guy was always waiting for her by the small woods to feed the cats together.

Ella hadn't heard from Zoey in days, and Zoey hadn't shown up either. Ella just figured Zoey didn't believe her and decided to stay out of it.

That day, Ella went to the small woods to feed the cats like usual after work.

Surprisingly, her neighbor, Lawrence Parker wasn't there. He'd been there every day when Ella got off work.

But she hadn't seen the cats for a few days and had no clue where they went.

Today, the cats were back, but Lawrence was MIA.

Ella squatted down and petted a kitten that came up to her. "Are you new around here? I haven't seen you before."

The cats in front of her weren't the same ones from the neighborhood.

Even though it was weird, she didn't think too much about it. Stray animals always moved around, just like her.

After feeding the cats, Ella was about to leave when the cats suddenly started meowing. One even bit her pant leg, like it didn't want her to go.

Ella sighed. "Sorry, I can barely take care of myself. Maybe you'll find a better owner someday. I gotta go now!"

She stood up to leave.

As she turned, she saw a figure at the end of the path.

The streetlight cast shadows over his face, but Ella recognized him instantly.

"Lawrence?" she called out hesitantly.

Lawrence was still in his black hoodie, faded jeans, and black and white canvas shoes.

"You're early today," Lawrence said with a faint smile.

It hit Ella; she'd been working late the past few days, but today she finished early, almost an hour ahead of her usual time.

She walked a bit closer to Lawrence. "Yeah, no overtime today."

"Had dinner yet?" Lawrence asked casually as she got closer.

Ella's heart skipped a beat, and she quickly glanced at Lawrence before looking down. "Not yet."

"I haven't either. Want to grab a bite?" Lawrence invited.

Ella, excited by the invite from the guy she liked, quickly agreed, "Sure!"

Lawrence said his car was parked at the neighborhood entrance, so they walked out together.

As they reached the gate, there was indeed a white Santana parked by the roadside.

Lawrence led her towards the Santana, but the closer they got, the more uneasy Ella felt.

Something in her gut told her not to get in that car.

"Lawrence, I just remembered I have something to do. I need to go back. Sorry, I can't have dinner with you," Ella said, turning to leave.

But as soon as she took a step, she heard hurried footsteps behind her.

She turned around in horror, and a hand clamped over her mouth.

A strong, chemical smell filled her nose and mouth, and Ella passed out before she could scream.

As she went limp in his arms, Lawrence's refined face twisted into a sinister smile as he prepared to drag her to the car.

But just as he turned, a fist came flying at him.

Lawrence leaned back to dodge, and Ella fell to the ground.

He frowned at Zoey, who was wearing a white T-shirt and jeans, her beautiful face stern and her eyes sharp.

"It's you!" Lawrence adjusted his glasses, a refined and shy smile on his face.

Behind his glasses, his eyes gleamed with the determination of a hunter who had found his prey.

Zoey glanced at Ella, who was lying unconscious on the ground, and sneered, "You may look human, but your actions say otherwise."

It was around ten o'clock at night, and this old neighborhood was mostly inhabited by elderly people, so the streets were empty, and no one knew that a kidnapping was taking place.

As for Zoey, who had suddenly appeared, Lawrence thought she was just another prey.

Lawrence wasn't panicked at all; he even looked at Zoey with interest. He said, "This is the first time someone has described me like that!"

Zoey always believed that villains died from talking too much! She didn't waste words with such scum and went straight to action.

Zoey wasn't very strong, but she had great explosive power. She suddenly threw a punch, catching him off guard.

Lawrence was hit and turned his head, and before he could react and defend himself, Zoey kicked him over and pinned him to the ground, beating him up.

She had been waiting in Ella's neighborhood for four days, finally catching Lawrence in the act. In that moment, she vented all the frustration accumulated from being bitten by mosquitoes over the past few days.

When Mark arrived after receiving the news, Zoey was squatting by the roadside, eating a hot dog.

Two people lay at her feet, one of them beaten beyond recognition, whom Mark didn't know, but the other he recognized well, it was Ella who had reported being watched.

"What happened?" Mark pointed at the man who was beaten beyond recognition.

Zoey, biting her hot dog, said, "This is the suspect, disguised as a neighbor to get close to Ella, trying to drug her and take her away. When discovered, he even tried to attack me!"

Seeing the suspect beaten so badly, Mark suddenly understood John's frustration.

He gritted his teeth and instructed Joseph, "Call an ambulance; this level of injury needs medical attention!"

Joseph called an ambulance and sent both the victim and the suspect to the hospital.

When Ella woke up, the first thing she smelled was the pungent odor of disinfectant, and she was immediately terrified.

News of single women being kidnapped, having their organs harvested, and dying in hospitals flashed through her mind. She almost broke down and cried out!

###chapter 6

But then, a familiar figure walked through the hospital door. It was Zoey.

"Officer Brown, is that you?" Ella's eyes lit up with excitement, a weird feeling stirring in her chest.

"Yep, it's me." Zoey checked with the doctor about Ella's condition and then filled her in. "The doc says you're good, just inhaled a bit of sedative. Luckily, it wasn't much, so no harm done."

Ella suddenly got it. "Officer Brown, have you been tailing me these past few days to protect me?"

If Zoey hadn't shown up, who knew what could've happened.

Even though it was a relief that the bad guy got caught, Ella started crying.

Zoey was totally at a loss when people cried out of nowhere; she never knew how to handle it.

Ella looked up at Zoey with her tear-streaked face and said, "I really didn't expect you to believe me."

Zoey got why she was crying right away.

She told Ella, "It's totally normal. You're not crazy. It takes guts for a girl to come to the police station and report something like this."

Ella said, "Thanks for believing me, Officer Brown."

"No problem, it's our job." Zoey sat next to her and asked, "How are you feeling now?"

Ella replied, "Pretty clear-headed!"

"Alright, since you're okay, let's get your statement." Zoey pulled out the recording device.

She bit off the pen cap, ready to get to work.

Ella nodded. "Okay."

On the way back to the station, Mark and Joseph were chatting about the statement they just took, finding it pretty funny.

"What's with everyone these days? Why do they all claim to be sick as soon as they're caught?" Joseph was baffled. He said that because Lawrence claimed to have a mental illness.

Mark said, "Why else? They think they can get away with it when they're committing the crime and don't think about the consequences. When they get caught, they claim to be sick to buy time."

Just checking out the claim could take days. It was a more humane part of the law, but it also let these criminals take advantage of it.

Joseph said, "Lawrence probably knows his crime isn't that serious."

The victim wasn't badly hurt, and as long as the victim agreed to settle privately, the case could be closed with some compensation.

Zoey, resting with her eyes closed, smirked.

Just because she showed up in the nick of time to save Ella and stop the suspect from doing something worse didn't mean a crime wasn't attempted.

Joseph said, "I heard Lawrence owns a small grocery store. How could he do something like this with a bright future?"

"That's why you can't judge a book by its cover," Mark said as he organized the files.

As cops, they saw all kinds of cases throughout the year, involving criminals who ranged from stunningly beautiful to downright ugly.

Mark yawned. "We worry too much. It all depends on what Ella decides to do." They all knew that given Lawrence's current situation, he wouldn't be locked up for long.

The car went quiet again.

Zoey, who hadn't said a word the whole ride, finally spoke up, "Officer Miller, should we check out Lawrence's phone and address?"

"Checking the phone is easy, but getting into his address is a whole different ball game. We can't just do it on our own." They needed a search warrant from their higher-ups.

Getting a search warrant was a slow process, especially for cases like Lawrence's that weren't considered serious criminal offenses. It was even harder to get approval.

By the time they got the warrant, the case would be over, and all their work would be for nothing.

Mark nodded in agreement. "Yeah, you're new here, so you don't know. We get tons of cases like this in our small town. Unless it's a homicide, there's no point in asking for a search warrant."

Mark added, "Well, the victim is fine, with no injuries that can be classified, nor any marks that can be used for sentencing. Although releasing Lawrence is problematic, what else can we do?"

Zoey thought of a possible lead and calmly said, "What about the sedative he used?"

Mark picked up the evidence bag and showed it to Zoey. Inside was a white towel, the one Lawrence used to sedate Ella.

"Useless. You want to use this to get a search warrant? Sometimes the internet being too advanced isn't a good thing. Some online stores sell anything for a quick buck. How do you want to trace it? Where do you even start?" Mark's tone was filled with frustration.

If they started investigating, their workload would skyrocket. If they found something, great, but if not, it would just create more work for their colleagues, who would definitely complain.

Zoey took a deep breath and looked out the window.

The night sky was like a painter's masterpiece, dark and pure. There were no stars tonight.

The whole sky looked like a bottomless pit, as if evil was reaching out to humanity.

It was already early morning, and the city streets were empty, with only a few lonely streetlights casting a faint glow, adding to the desolation.

Zoey slowly said, "The main point is Ella was affected by the sedative. We can use the need to find more evidence of the sedative to apply for a search warrant."

Joseph looked at her, confused. "Isn't the evidence right here?"

Zoey said, "What if we pretend we didn't find it? Would that work?"

Joseph was puzzled.

After a moment, Joseph's brain caught up, and he suddenly got what Zoey meant. They could act like they hadn't found the sedative on Lawrence and use that as an excuse to get a search warrant.

Mark, who always played by the book, firmly disagreed, "We can't deceive our own people. If we have it, we have it. Besides, I've worked with the forensic team for years, and I know a bit. Any drug component is volatile, which is why we need to send the evidence over immediately! If we delay, it will mess up the forensic analysis. Then who will take responsibility for that?"

###chapter 7

Zoey got where Mark was coming from, but she wasn't about to let any bad guy off the hook. She pressed her lips together and said, "Ella's already given the hospital enough evidence. Whether we have this towel or not doesn't really change things. If we're gonna nail Lawrence, we need more proof."

"What proof? What else do you want to dig up on Lawrence?" Mark cut in, sounding frustrated. "Zoey, are you solving cases based on your gut feelings? Is this what they taught you at the police academy? We've already gone through Lawrence's records with a fine-tooth comb! His file is spotless, except for this one incident."

Joseph could feel the tension rising in the car and quickly tried to calm things down. "Zoey, we've really looked into Lawrence's background thoroughly, and there's nothing suspicious."

"Nothing suspicious?" Zoey's voice went up a notch. "A regular stalker would follow someone for weeks without making a move?"

Zoey explained, "A stalker is someone who keeps tracking, harassing, or spying on someone, invading their personal space. They're usually obsessed or dependent on their target, and their behavior might be driven by personality disorders or other mental issues. These problems make it hard for them to control their impulses, leading to stalking. They might keep following their target, invade their space, and send threatening messages or items, making the target feel scared, anxious, or stressed."

Zoey took a deep breath and paused for a moment before continuing, "But didn't Ella feel like she was being followed, which is why she reported it? If she's felt that way since the 20th of last month, it's been a month and a half, right? If he hadn't done anything all this time and just scared her, that'd be one thing. But he did make a move! Do you get what I'm saying?"

She went on, "A stalker would just stalk and not harm Ella. The fact that he made a move means he's not just a stalker but a criminal who's been lurking around Ella for a long time, planning to hurt her!"

He didn't fit the profile of someone with a mental illness but rather a psychological disorder.

Joseph seemed to get it but also looked a bit lost. "So, you're saying Lawrence isn't just a stalker?"

Zoey sighed. "That's not exactly what I mean."

Joseph still looked puzzled. He kept his eyes on her. "Then what do you mean?"

Zoey glanced at Mark through the rearview mirror. "A well-known foreign psychologist once did a study on hundreds of criminals who liked stalking and peeping, and he roughly categorized them into several types."

"There are rejected stalkers, intimacy seekers, incompetent stalkers, resentful stalkers, and predatory stalkers," Zoey explained slowly. "The most dangerous is the last type. They don't stalk to get closer to their target or to steal their clothes for some weird fetish. It's more like a predator-prey thing. They get a kick out of watching their victims secretly, enjoying the thrill of scaring them. When the victim is most terrified, they jump out and kill them!"

She added, "This type of stalker is the most likely to turn into a serial killer. Once they start, they can't seem to stop even if they want to."

That was why, after killing a couple of people, these stalkers just kept going.

Their twisted pleasure came from seeing their prey on the edge of death.

It only took a few minutes for their victims to die. To keep that thrill alive, they had to keep killing.

When Zoey finished talking, the car was still dead silent.

You could hear a pin drop. No one said a word.

After a bit, Joseph, trying to break the awkwardness, forced a compliment. "You're amazing; you know more than I do."

Zoey felt a bit frustrated. That wasn't the response she was hoping for!

She knew Joseph was just trying to smooth things over. Then both Zoey and Joseph looked at Mark.

Zoey just wanted to know what Mark thought of her idea.

Mark shook his head. "This is just speculation, not evidence. No matter how much theory you have, it's useless."

Zoey lowered her eyes, feeling disappointed. She stopped talking and stared out the window.

Suddenly, something landed in her lap from the back. She looked down and saw it was a white towel in a dust-free bag.

Mark said, "When you get to the station, go to the forensics department and find Henry Phillips. Tell him I'll treat him to drink tomorrow."

Mark's message was clear.

Zoey held the evidence, stunned for a moment. Joseph was also moved by the gesture, saying, "Officer Jones, you're amazing, you're my idol!"

Mark looked at the two of them seriously. "Alright, act normal."

"Okay!" Joseph was overly excited.

Zoey, sitting in the front passenger seat, took a moment to gather herself and then said softly, "I'll pay for the drinks."

Mark replied, "That's more like it."

Zoey suddenly thought of something and turned to ask, "But are you sure you're in a condition to drink now?"

Mark retorted, "Why not?"

Zoey said, "Alright then."

The three of them chatted about similar past cases, and by the time they got back to the station, it was already 3 AM.

Zoey decided to have some instant noodles to fill her empty stomach and spend the night at her desk in the office. She slept until work hours the next day. The desk was so hard, but she didn't wake up all night.

The next day, Emma woke her up by patting her arm. "You're taking up our chairs, how are we supposed to work?"

Zoey groggily got up, and the chairs were taken away one by one.

One of Zoey's colleagues brought her some long breadsticks and soy milk.

She picked up the bread and was about to take a bite when she saw Emma opening her own delicious-looking breakfast.

The aroma of Emma's breakfast quickly spread throughout the station.

Zoey couldn't be bothered to look at her and continued eating her soy milk and bread, because she found it quite satisfying in its own way.

Emma, seeing that Zoey wasn't paying attention to her, smacked her lips on purpose and then spoke to Zoey, "Girls shouldn't stay up late every day. Our skin needs to regenerate. If you keep this up, your skin will sag."

It was obvious to everyone that she was getting back at Zoey for the last time.

###chapter 8

"Seriously?" Zoey pulled out a compact mirror from her bag.

She checked herself out, then glanced at Emma. "No matter how I look at it, my skin's way better than yours."

Emma was fuming inside. With colleagues around and her perfect image to maintain, she had to keep her cool.

She quickly composed herself and switched topics, "I heard Officer Jones put you on some investigation work recently. How's that going? Found any leads?"

She asked, waiting for Zoey's response.

Zoey had always been more impressive at the police academy, while Emma was more popular and likable.

What good were Zoey's top grades? She wasn't living as well as Emma now.

"None of your business," Zoey shot back bluntly.

Emma felt like she had hit a wall, seething with anger.

She had said so much, but Zoey's one-liner shut her down completely. Her heart felt like it was being crushed by a heavy weight, making it hard to breathe!

Zoey, however, couldn't care less and quickly finished her breakfast.

As the morning dragged on, Mark and Joseph were still nowhere to be seen, so Zoey figured they must have gone to Lawrence's place to investigate.

Just as she thought that, the two of them walked in.

Mark spotted Zoey and called out to her.

Zoey asked, "Officer Jones, what's up?"

"Don't you want to know how Joseph and I did at Lawrence's place?" Officer Mark asked.

But Zoey didn't seem too interested.

Mainly because whether they found any clues or not, it didn't really matter to her. She was just an investigator. If they did find something based on her lead, it would go to the criminal investigation department, which had nothing to do with her.

"Not really," Zoey replied.

Mark noticed her attitude was completely different from last night.

The more she didn't want to know, the more Mark wanted her to know!

"Just ask," Mark's tone was a bit impatient.

"I need to use my time for something meaningful," Zoey said.

Seeing Zoey about to leave, Mark didn't push it. "Alright, we found a lot at Lawrence's place thanks to your lead. But Zoey, you need to know this might just be a fluke. Not every case will have such luck. Now, get ready to head to Lawrence's place. You'll escort him to the criminal investigation department later."

Zoey gave Mark a complicated look. "I don't want to go."

"This case was cracked by you. If you don't go, who will?" Mark smiled and patted her shoulder. "You must read a lot. I see you always with those foreign psychology books. Send me the links after dealing with Lawrence."

"Alright," Zoey said.

Zoey had no choice but to go. Besides, Mark was right. If she hadn't raised objections last night, Lawrence would have gotten away.

If someone else went to the criminal investigation department, they wouldn't be able to explain why a simple stalking case was linked to a criminal investigation.

Zoey was about to head out but realized she had no idea where Lawrence's place was. She turned back and asked, "Where exactly is Lawrence's place?"

Mark replied, "It's in the same neighborhood as Ella's. I'll have Joseph send the details to your phone."

Zoey nodded. "Got it."

She quickly packed up and made her way to Ella's neighborhood.

Having spent several days there protecting Ella, she knew the area pretty well.

The drive from the police station to Ella's neighborhood took a bit, so Zoey used the time to catch up on some much-needed sleep.

When she arrived, she quickly found Lawrence's building, which was right across from Ella's.

As soon as she opened the building door, a musty smell hit her. Even though it was daytime, the hallway was pitch dark.

Switching on her flashlight, Zoey counted the floors one by one until she reached the top, the sixth floor, where Lawrence's apartment was.

She spotted the police tape on the left side and knew it was Lawrence's place.

She had just taken a couple of steps towards it when the police tape was lifted from the inside, and a figure emerged.

Due to the darkness, Zoey couldn't see the man's face.

As he got closer, the man shone a flashlight right in her face. The blinding light was so annoying that Zoey felt like smacking him.

She had just raised her hand when the man blocked her.

"Your temper is still as fiery as ever, huh?" A familiar male voice reached her ears, and Zoey instantly recognized it-Alexander.

Just then, the hallway lights flickered on, illuminating the once dark corridor.

"What does my temper have to do with you?" Zoey replied with disdain.

Alexander was indeed good-looking, but she couldn't stand him.

"A bad temper affects your mindset. You can't concentrate and handle cases well with a bad attitude. We're police officers; we need to live up to the responsibilities given to us by the people," Alexander said, clearly speaking for her benefit.

No matter who he was talking to, he was always gentle and kind.

Alexander looked at the indifferent Zoey.

Zoey glanced at Lawrence's apartment. "Move, you're in the way."

Alexander smiled and watched her enter the suspect's place.

The staff handed Zoey the disposable equipment used at the scene.

Zoey took it, skillfully put on the gloves, lifted the police tape, and walked in.

The scene had been examined multiple times, with every nook and cranny meticulously scrutinized for evidence.

She was late, and there wasn't much left for her to do.

All the windows in Lawrence's apartment were open, and a faint smell of smoke wafted from the kitchen, followed by the sound of a toilet flushing.

A middle-aged man emerged; the most noticeable thing about him was his almost bald head, with just a few strands of hair left standing.

His tired dark circles seemed to be a common trait among police officers. He yawned as he walked towards Zoey. "Are you the one Mark sent?"

###chapter 9

Alexander showed up and made the introductions, "Hey, this is Zoey Brown."

Zoey nodded politely, "Hi, I'm Zoey Brown."

"Hey Zoey, I'm Robert Davis, but just call me Robert." After some small talk, Robert got straight to it. "Mark's been singing your praises about the Lawrence case, saying you were the one who noticed something was off. That's pretty impressive, Zoey. Which police academy did you go to? They must've trained you well."

Zoey answered, "Emerald Police Academy."

"Emerald Police Academy?" Robert seemed to have a lightbulb moment. He glanced between Zoey and Alexander. "You two went to the same school? But you two don't seem that close. You don't know each other?"

"We do. We were classmates," Alexander grinned. "Robert, you have no idea. She's amazing. With her grades, getting into the Criminal Investigation Department should've been a walk in the park, but something unexpected happened."

Robert's curiosity was piqued, "What happened? Spill the beans..."

Before he could finish, Zoey cut in, "Can you first tell me about the investigation results at the scene?"

Robert got the hint. Zoey wasn't into sharing personal stuff, so he let it go.

"Sure, let me fill you in on the current situation," Robert said.

Zoey nodded and followed him.

As she walked past Alexander, she gave him a quick look.

Alexander just kept smiling at her.

The bathroom had a big bathtub that seemed out of place in the small space. The sink was cramped, and the tub took up most of the room.

There were professional markings on the tiles next to the tub. Robert pointed them out, "See this? It's clearly marked, and we found a luminol reaction here; nowhere else showed any signs. Plus, the water usage was unusually high for a guy living alone."

Zoey tilted her head, waiting for more.

Robert continued, "The water usage on the 7th was three times the normal amount."

He then pointed out a puzzling issue, "We checked all the reported stalking and missing person cases at the local station. None seem directly linked to Lawrence. Let's not even talk about the older cases, just the recent ones. According to Mark, your informant felt they were being followed around mid-last month, and it's been half a month since. Whether Lawrence has a crime cooling-off period or not, with the current evidence, we can't touch him."

"What about the water meter readings from previous months?" Zoey asked.

Robert replied, "We checked those too, all normal. Lawrence only moved in a few months ago. The landlord showed us his monthly water bills." Robert, being thorough, added, "As for where Lawrence lived before, our colleagues are on it, so we just need to wait for the results."

Zoey carefully examined every corner of the bathroom.

The bathroom was surprisingly tidy, better than most single guys' places, especially the vanity, which was spotless.

Zoey thought to herself, 'Wow, his skincare game is better than mine. Lawrence really knew how to live it up.'

After checking every nook and cranny, Zoey didn't find anything suspicious and left the bathroom.

Lawrence's old apartment was about 700 square feet, not huge, but it was spotless.

The kitchen and living room were connected, and Lawrence had put a full-length mirror in the hallway to make the place feel cozier.

Alexander, wearing white gloves, moved the mirror and found a strand of long golden hair on the floor.

"Hey, come check this out!" Alexander called out.

The technicians stopped what they were doing and rushed over.

They had been searching for a while and had missed this spot. Finally, a breakthrough!

Zoey joined them. The technician used tweezers to pick up the roughly 12-inch long hair. Lawrence had a short haircut, so this hair definitely wasn't his. But it was connected to him somehow!

The technician's eyes lit up as he carefully placed the hair into a dust-free bag. "I can't believe we missed this. Nice catch, Alexander."

Alexander moved the mirror aside and glanced at Zoey, speaking calmly, "Women's long hair is usually harder to clean up than men's. I just took a shot. I remember our teacher saying that higher hormone levels in women make their hair better quality and more adhesive."

He looked at the dust-free bag in the technician's hand, feeling satisfied.

"Nice work," the technician gave Alexander a thumbs up. At least they found something worthwhile tonight.

Alexander shrugged modestly, "Just a lucky find."

He glanced at Zoey again, as if to say his years in the criminal investigation department hadn't been for nothing.

Zoey was a bit speechless.

She turned to the technician, "Any other anomalies?"

The technician shook his head. "Nope. But I did find out Lawrence is secretly loaded." He kicked the robot vacuum next to the sofa. "I've been eyeing this model for months; it costs a fortune! I can't bring myself to buy it."

He looked at the spotless floor and sighed, "Man, expensive stuff really works. This floor is cleaner than my face."

Zoey, who was also on a budget, frowned slightly. "This thing must do more than just clean the floor."

Even though she didn't spell it out, everyone was thinking the same thing. Could it also be used to clean up crime evidence?

Alexander chimed in, "I looked into Lawrence's finances. His supermarket pulls in about ten grand a month. After rent and taxes, and considering his online shopping habits, he could afford a robotic vacuum cleaner."

Zoey almost forgot that Alexander's parents were loaded.

Zoey's voice was cool, "Don't assume everyone lives like you."

Alexander looked puzzled at Zoey, but she just ignored him.

###chapter 10

Zoey strolled over to the bedroom next to the master bedroom. She nudged the door open and stepped inside. The room was bare except for a wooden bed, looking like it hadn't been touched in ages.

It was obvious this room didn't see much action. Lawrence probably never came in here; there were no signs of life at all.

Zoey's cop instincts kicked in, and she started poking around. She yanked open the heavy curtains, letting the sunlight flood in. A corner of the curtain knocked some dust off the windowsill.

Feeling a bit sleepy, she yawned, glanced out the window at the neighborhood, and was about to head out.

But as she passed the nightstand, she stopped dead in her tracks. Something was off.

If Lawrence was a clean freak, why would he clean the nightstand but leave the windowsill dusty? Anyone who had ever cleaned a room knew it was easy to wipe down a small area. This inconsistency meant...

"What are you looking at? The tech team already checked everything." Alexander's sudden voice made Zoey jump.

She pulled herself together, her brows knitting in annoyance.

Alexander noticed she was pissed at him but didn't seem to care. "Find anything?"

Zoey snapped, "Does the difference in dust thickness count as a discovery?" She shot him a look and continued, "The nightstand is spotless, but the windowsill has a thin layer of dust. If Lawrence was a neat freak, he wouldn't miss that. So I think someone else lived here, and Lawrence wiped out all traces of them."

Zoey started opening the drawers one by one. They were empty.

"Lawrence doesn't have a girlfriend, right?" she asked.

Alexander replied, "He said he didn't when we interviewed him, but who knows if that's true. The surveillance in this old neighborhood is pretty bad, and getting footage from other spots would be a hassle."

"What about his neighbors?" Zoey asked.

"They're not around. We don't know why yet. We haven't even talked to the only employee at Lawrence's supermarket," Alexander said.

Zoey's frown deepened. "If Lawrence has been living alone, this neighborhood is perfect for covering up a murder."

"Even though this place is old and rundown, it's convenient. There's a subway and bus stop right outside, a food street nearby, and all the essentials for living. Plus, it's close to his supermarket," Alexander replied.

Zoey shot him a cold look. "Rich people just don't get our world."

Alexander went quiet.

"No need to target me," he finally said.

Zoey yawned. "I just call it like I see it."

She was about to leave, but Alexander blocked her at the door.

He leaned against the doorframe, looking at her. "Do we really have to do this?"

"Do what?" Zoey replied coolly.

Alexander said, "I was just sharing my opinion, but you always have to contradict me."

Zoey lifted her head, her tone serious. "I'm just being real. How could rich folks possibly get what it's like for us regular people? Ever been broke? And you should check out more homes. That robot vacuum cleaner he's got is probably a rare sight in this whole city."

In Zoey's eyes, it was way too extravagant. Most people were all about saving money, focusing on practical stuff instead of dropping thousands on a fancy vacuum cleaner. It just didn't make sense.

Zoey went on, "For a single guy with such a high standard of living, why would he rent a place like this?"

She added, "These days, there are plenty of nice apartments around. Do you think someone making over ten grand a month would spend three thousand to rent a dump like this? And he even left one room empty instead of using it for storage?"

Alexander had to admit, she had a point. "You think Lawrence kept a woman locked up in this room for a long time? If that's true, it could explain a lot."

The gap between the two victims was really short.

Zoey's lips curled into a cold smile. "Move aside! Don't block me!"

She reached out to push him away.

Alexander stood firm with just a little effort.

But seeing Zoey's face darken, Alexander decided to step aside.

He pulled back with a grin, giving her space.

Zoey had no choice but to brush past him to get out. As she did, Alexander's unique scent hit her.

She vaguely remembered that during their combat class at the police academy, when they sparred, he had the same scent. She didn't know if it was cologne or something else, but he was definitely vain.

Zoey rolled her eyes at him.

Seeing that the investigation at Lawrence's house was almost done, Zoey noticed Robert on the phone, looking serious.

"What do you mean you can't get into their house even with a search warrant? The internet tells people to be wary of strangers every day, but it doesn't say to be wary of the police! I don't know if these people are too cautious or what! Show them your badges properly and get them to cooperate!"

Robert noticed Zoey watching him out of the corner of his eye.

He hung up the phone and waved her over.

Zoey walked over.

Robert gave her a long look, the smell of smoke heavy in the air. "I told Mark that until this Lawrence case is over, you'll be sticking with me. No need to go back to your team for now. I'll take you and Alexander to grab a bite to eat, then show you around."

Zoey nodded. "Okay."

It was late autumn, and at five in the afternoon, the city wasn't completely dark yet.

Robert took Zoey and Alexander to a random restaurant. The waiter handed over the menu, and Robert politely gave it to the only woman among them. "Ladies first, order whatever you want; don't be shy."

Zoey seriously looked at the menu and ordered everything she wanted.

###chapter 11

Zoey ordered five mouth-watering dishes and two big bowls of pasta.

Robert raised an eyebrow, "You don't do main courses?"

Zoey shrugged, "I do."

"So, the pasta's all for you?" Robert couldn't help but be impressed by Zoey's appetite. "Is your department that slammed? When's the last time you had a decent meal?"

Zoey looked up calmly. "I had a pretty big breakfast."

Robert went quiet.

The waiter took their order and headed off. Robert glanced at Alexander, then back at Zoey.

"Alright, eat up. You need the energy to catch those bad guys!" Robert said casually.

Zoey always had this cool, detached vibe, like nothing really got to her. But she agreed with Robert. Because of that, Robert's image as a balding middle-aged guy suddenly seemed more dependable to Zoey.

She was about to say something when Alexander cut in, "Robert, back in school, Zoey was all about proving girls could do anything guys could. She beat a bunch of boys at arm-wrestling!"

"Really? Did she beat you?" Robert asked Alexander, clearly intrigued.

He always felt like Zoey and Alexander, despite not seeming super close, must have had some good times back in school.

Alexander chuckled, "I ate a lot back then, so I barely beat Zoey because I was bigger."

"I thought you lost too," Robert laughed, looking at Zoey again. "But hey, no shame in losing to Alexander."

Zoey was speechless. She could've eaten another bowl of pasta, but now she had totally lost her appetite!

Just then, the food arrived.

Zoey ignored him and focused on her meal.

After everyone was stuffed, Robert paid the bill and planned to take Zoey back to their place to get her familiar with the area.

Robert was pretty tired and immediately climbed into the back seat, yawning. "I've been up all night with this case. I'll crash in the back, wake me when we get there."

"Got it," Alexander said, sliding into the driver's seat.

With Robert snoozing, Zoey naturally took the passenger seat.

Alexander started the car and glanced at Zoey. "Seatbelt."

Even though Zoey wasn't a fan of his, she buckled up.

Alexander kept his eyes on the road, driving smoothly.

Feeling a bit bored, Alexander tried to chat with Zoey. "Got a driver's license?"

"What do you think?" Zoey shot him a look, her tone dripping with annoyance.

Alexander grinned, "I remember you always wanted one. Did you pass?"

Zoey found him irritating and turned to look out the window, her body angled away.

Seeing she didn't want to talk, Alexander wasn't fazed and kept smiling. "Since things are slow now, maybe you should get your license. It'd be handy for work."

Cops had to know how to drive; it was a survival skill these days.

Zoey snapped, "You're so annoying!"

Alexander frowned, feeling a bit hurt. "I'm just looking out for you."

Catching her disdainful look, Alexander sighed. "Do you really hate me that much?"

"Isn't it obvious? I don't want to talk to you. Can't you see?" Zoey shot back, closing her eyes to rest.

Alexander grumbled, "I get it, but driving is boring."

Zoey retorted, "That's your problem."

Alexander argued, "How can it be just mine? You're in the passenger seat. Shouldn't you keep me company and chat to keep me awake?"

Zoey shrugged, "If you crash, that's on you."

Alexander insisted, "No way, I have to think about your and Robert's safety."

Zoey went silent, really wanting to smack him.

From the back seat, Robert, trying to sleep, groaned, "Come on, for God's sake, be quiet, okay?"

Robert's words did the trick. The car went quiet.

Robert closed his eyes again, using his jacket to cover his face, and fell asleep faster.

Worried they'd start up again, he lifted his jacket and warned, "I'm serious! No more talking!"

Zoey nodded. "Okay, don't worry."

She rolled her eyes at Alexander, her disdain clear.

She turned slightly and tried to sleep.

About an hour later, Alexander pulled up to the station.

Zoey got out of the passenger seat, immediately captivated by the grand entrance of the criminal investigation department. The decor was similar to their department but way more impressive.

Zoey thought, 'I bet the food in their cafeteria is amazing too.'

When they arrived, officers from the criminal investigation department were getting off work.

The station was bustling, people constantly moving around. Zoey observed the scene, noting how different it was from their station. At this time, if their station had no urgent matters, everyone would have gone home.

The criminal investigation department seemed busier at night than during the day. Made sense; criminals didn't usually work 9 to 5.

Robert led Zoey inside and brought her to their office.

As soon as Zoey walked in, she was struck by the chaotic atmosphere-it felt more like a farmers' market than a criminal investigation department.

People were frantically discussing cases, everyone preoccupied with their own tasks.

Zoey looked around, feeling gloomier.

What a mess! The noise was giving her a headache. How could anyone focus on discussing cases in such a place?

Robert returned to his desk, glanced around, and realized there was no place for Zoey. She wasn't part of their team, so no one had prepared any office supplies for her.

He quickly thought of a solution and instinctively looked at Alexander.

###chapter 12

Alexander got what Robert was hinting at right away. He hesitated, "You mean..."

Robert grinned, "You're both interns. You've seen how cramped our department is. Sharing a desk isn't a big deal since we're barely in the office anyway."

Before Alexander could say anything, Robert had already set Zoey up at his desk. "Alright, Zoey, you sit here."

Then Robert turned and went off to handle other stuff.

Zoey wanted to say no, but after seeing the state of the detective department, she reluctantly agreed.

Alexander, being the nice guy he was, somehow found an extra chair and asked her warmly, "Do you want to sit next to me or across from me?"

Zoey took the chair from him and chose to sit across. She wasn't too fond of him and besides, there was a window behind that spot. When the weather was nice, the sunlight would stream in, and she loved the warm, comforting feeling of the sun on her back.

Robert came back to his messy desk, rummaged through the piles of documents, and tossed a stack of files onto their desk. "These are the missing persons cases from the past three months, from around Lawrence's current and previous residences. Take a good look."

Zoey and Alexander both said, "Alright," and split the files between them.

At ten that night, Robert got a call. From his reaction, it seemed like it was about the two officers who had gone to check out a residence but hadn't gone in. He cursed, grabbed his car keys, and left.

As the day turned into night, the energy in the office seemed to drop. It wasn't as noisy as during the day; everyone was pretty quiet.

Zoey looked at the mountain of case files and yawned, feeling exhausted.

She stretched out of habit, and Alexander, sitting across from her, instinctively looked up and asked, "Are you hungry? There are late-night snacks here."

"Not hungry," she replied flatly.

Alexander said, "The free late-night snacks in our cafeteria are pretty good."

Hearing that it was free, Zoey stood up. "Where are they?"

There was definitely a difference between the city police department and their county one. Not only was the office nicer, but even the cafeteria looked like a college dining hall.

There were all kinds of food, making it hard to choose. Not only were the three meals free, but even the late-night snacks were, which was great for someone as broke as Zoey.

Zoey got her favorite pasta and looked around while eating.

There weren't as many people as during the day, but there were still quite a few coming and going. Some even brought their files, working as they ate.

It was clear that the city police department was super busy.

She quickly finished her plate and grabbed a piece of toast to take away. Alexander saw this and was stunned.

Alexander asked, "Didn't you have a big dinner?"

Zoey rolled her eyes at him. "Is it your business?"

Alexander was quiet for a moment.

"No, you got me wrong," he said, "I was just worried you might eat too much and not digest well. Don't girls usually care about their figure?"

"I like being a bit chubby," Zoey said, taking a big bite of the toast and grinning at Alexander.

Alexander went silent again. He instinctively picked up his water cup and took a sip.

Zoey was definitely not someone you could judge by normal standards. She was never ordinary.

But Alexander knew Zoey well; she had an incredibly strong will and was relentless in her quest to catch criminals.

He just gave her a light glance and didn't say anything more.

When Zoey finished eating and got back to the office, Robert was leading two people inside.

They bumped into Zoey and Alexander.

Robert took the chance to introduce Zoey, "This is Dennis Gonzalez, look at this outstanding guy, barely any hair left." He joked, patting Dennis on his bald head.

Compared to Dennis, Robert still had quite a bit of hair.

Robert then added, "The guy next to Dennis is Charles Green. He's only been with the team for a year. He's a bit older than you."

Charles Green. Zoey repeated the name in her mind.

She looked at Dennis. He had a stern face. If he weren't in the detective department, she might have mistaken him for a criminal and followed him for a few blocks based on her gut feeling.

His fierce look, combined with his role as a cop, actually made him seem more secure.

He smiled warmly at Zoey, "Zoey, nice to meet you. If you need anything, just let me know and I'll help you out."

Zoey politely replied, "Thank you."

Then she looked at Charles. Standing next to Dennis, they were really worlds apart.

Charles had a delicate and handsome face. If you looked closely, he was quite cute. His innocent eyes made it hard to believe he was a detective, because he always had a bit of a foolish look. When he spoke, he even seemed a bit dim-witted.

"Hi, do you like snacks?" He reached into his pocket.

Before she could respond, he had already handed her some candy.

Zoey didn't refuse. "Thank you."

"You're welcome. We're going to be good friends fighting side by side." Charles patted Zoey on the shoulder.

He used so much force that he almost knocked Zoey over.

Seeing that they were getting along, Robert waved his hand. "Alright! Now that everyone knows each other, let's get to work!"

Everyone went back to their spots. Zoey sat down and immediately opened one of the candies Charles had given her.

Not only was the packaging fancy, but the taste was also really good.

She took a photo and tried to find it online to buy some for herself. After searching for a while, she realized the candy was quite expensive because it was imported! She couldn't afford it.

Zoey quietly closed the browser on her phone and continued to go through the case files.

Before she knew it, she started to feel sleepy.

Zoey wrote down the names of the victims she thought were important in another folder.

###chapter 13

Zoey looked at Robert and said, "Officer Davis, I've almost wrapped up the screening, sticking to Ella's conditions. We're looking for out-of-towners, women who keep to themselves and don't have much of a social life. Right now, I've got two names that fit the bill."

She took a deep breath, glancing at the names she had jotted down. "The key thing is, both of them went through sexual harassment."

Robert, who was yawning, suddenly perked up. "What?"

Alexander, standing nearby, was also caught off guard.

Zoey continued, "The first one is Lily Martin. I checked her file. Her dad went with her to report it. He said she was harassed at work, and it was her first time dealing with something like that."

She went on, "The second one is Aria Clark. She got harassed while hiking. To double-check, I reached out to Ella again."

Robert glanced at his watch. "When did you talk to her?"

"Just now," Zoey replied calmly. "She was awake and got back to me. I asked her about my hunch. She said she had also been sexually harassed. It happened on her way home one day, and it really shook her up, making her super aware of anything weird around her."

Zoey continued, "Officer Davis, I found something else. Lily disappeared four months ago, and Aria nine months ago... this cooling-off period..."

Alexander chimed in, "Based on what Officer Brown found, I have a case that fits your cooling-off period. Mine was six months ago."

Then he went on, "Her name is Stella Hall. She went through the same stuff Zoey mentioned. But she's different; she's disabled. She didn't want to make a scene in a big mall and felt self-conscious, so she kept quiet."

"Which one? I'll check it out right now!" Robert stood up, clearly pissed off.

Alexander stayed calm, "Wait until morning. I'll get in touch with the victims' friends."

"Damn it!" Dennis said, grabbing the investigation results and frowning. "This is really tough! Officer Davis, look at this. We can't solve this just by working hard!"

Robert said, "Each case was reported at different police stations, and the victims can't prove any other suspicions of being harmed... This means it can't be escalated to a criminal case. These scattered cases have been classified as ordinary missing persons cases by various stations... This shows that the suspect is really good at avoiding detection!"

Running around to different police stations wasn't a big deal. But once a case was classified, it couldn't be reopened just because they found traces of a sedative at the suspect's place.

Robert scratched his head in frustration. "That bastard!"

Being a seasoned officer, he quickly calmed down and gave orders, "It's too late today. Everyone go home and get some rest. Tomorrow, contact all the victims' families and see if there's any new info."

Zoey stretched out her arms and legs, feeling sore from sitting too long.

She yawned and followed Alexander to the dorms.

Alexander wasn't surprised by Zoey's performance today. She had been a star at the police academy, and now she was even better.

Out of the blue, Alexander asked, "You must've done pretty well at your last station, huh?"

That's probably why she got transferred to the criminal investigation department.

Zoey wanted to roll her eyes and say it wasn't his business. But she was more curious about his question, so she asked, "Why asking this?"

Alexander's tone got serious. "I think you've got a bright future ahead. Don't let past stuff mess it up, or you'll regret it."

Zoey sneered. If anyone else had said that, she might've been touched. But coming from Alexander, it just made her feel gross.

"Cut the crap, don't act all nice to me," Zoey snapped.

Alexander sighed deeply.

They reached the women's dorm.

He repeated to her the house number that Robert had told him.

Zoey didn't even look at him and walked straight ahead.

Alexander called out, "Wanna grab dinner tomorrow?"

Zoey shouted back, "Get lost!"

Then she slammed the door shut, making it clear how much she disliked him.

Early the next morning, the criminal investigation team was already busy, questioning the victims' families again about the incidents. They got all the locations where the incidents happened from their statements.

Luckily, since these were public areas, it was easy to get the surveillance footage.

Charles stared intently at the footage from the moment it started playing, not wanting to miss anything.

But the screen was filled with a sea of heads; everyone was looking down at their phones, with only a few faces visible.

"God, how are we supposed to find the victim?" Charles sighed in frustration, picking up Lily's photo and trying to match it with the heads on the screen. "She had slightly curly red hair, 5.5 feet tall." He compared the photo while searching the footage.

After a while, he exclaimed, "There she is."

Zoey quickly went over to look, but the sea of heads made her feel a bit claustrophobic. Where was the victim Charles mentioned?

Charles pointed to a spot on the screen. "Right here, see? The one wearing a hat."

In the crowded surveillance footage, Lily's face and features were completely obscured, especially since she was wearing a hat, making it even harder to spot her.

Unexpectedly, Charles found her. It proved the saying that everyone in the criminal investigation department had skills. They might seem ordinary, but they all had unique talents.

Zoey couldn't help but admire. "Charles, you're amazing."

Charles confidently patted his chest, feeling a bit proud. "Of course, I'm not as dumb as Officer Davis says."

###chapter 14

Dennis, with his small eyes, couldn't help but roll them at Charles. "Man, the only thing you've got going for you is your eyesight," he sneered.

Charles just shrugged, thinking Dennis was just being a hater.

Zoey suddenly had a lightbulb moment. She grabbed her notebook and showed everyone the bus and subway routes Ella usually took, all from memory.

She thought she was onto something big, but it turned out to be a dead end.

Frustrated, she turned to Charles. "Hey, can you help me find Ella?"

"Sure thing," Charles replied.

He picked up a photo of Ella and scanned the surveillance footage. In no time, he spotted a familiar figure leaning against the door. "Check it out, is this her? The height and outfit look about right, but she seems a bit shorter from this angle."

Zoey zoomed in and squinted at the screen, scrutinizing the figure Charles pointed out.

Even though the image was blurry, she recognized Ella right away. After all, they'd interacted a few times.

Zoey gave Charles a thumbs-up. "Nice job, man."

Charles blushed a little. "It's my only talent."

Without it, he wouldn't have lasted long in the criminal investigation department.

Ella had told Zoey she was harassed just before getting off the bus. Zoey pulled up the bus schedule and rewound the footage by half an hour.

She watched the footage frame by frame, starting from when Ella was about to get off.

In the last five minutes, the bus made a stop, and a bunch of new passengers got on.

Zoey zeroed in on the guys closest to Ella. One was a chubby middle-aged dude who looked kinda sketchy. The other was a sharp-dressed guy with a briefcase, clearly an office worker. Both were glued to their phones.

Suddenly, the bus jolted for some reason.

Zoey looked at Ella's face again and saw pure panic. To be sure, she rewound the footage and watched it in slow motion.

Soon, taller people around her blocked Ella's face.

From her body language, it was clear she was trying to move away from her spot.

This reaction was a dead giveaway. She must've been harassed when the bus shook!

Zoey's attention went back to the two men next to Ella, but they were still just playing with their phones, not giving anything away.

There were too many people, and all she could see were heads. Everything below their shoulders was hidden, so she couldn't tell if their other hands were up to something.

The footage caught the chubby guy's face but missed the office worker's. Still, Zoey was sure the office worker wasn't Lawrence.

Their hairstyles and outfits were different, and even though those could be changed, their body types were too.

Zoey furrowed her brow, doubting her earlier guesses. Maybe the harassment was just a fluke?

She took a deep breath and decided to call Ella.

Ella, knowing the creep who'd been stalking her was caught the day she was hospitalized, was in a much better mood. She was enjoying her time off and sounded pretty cheerful.

When she saw Zoey's call, she put down what she was doing and answered, "Hey, Officer Brown, what's up? Need my help with something?"

"Yeah," Zoey replied. "Are you free right now?"

Ella washed her hands and said, "Yep, I'm on vacation today, just chilling at home. I was about to cook."

"Great, can I steal about ten minutes of your time?" Zoey asked.

"Of course, no problem!" Ella dried her hands and plopped down on the sofa, ready for Zoey's questions.

Zoey's voice came through the phone. "You mentioned before that you were sexually harassed. I need some more details."

Ella said, "Sure, ask away. I'll tell you everything I remember."

Zoey thought about the surveillance footage and asked, "I'm looking at the bus footage. I saw a few guys standing near you, two of them really close. Do you remember them?"

Ella thought for a moment. "Kinda. One was a middle-aged guy, and the other was around my age, maybe a bit older. I even suspected the chubby middle-aged guy. He looked like a bad guy from a TV show. Not to judge by looks, but he really seemed sketchy. I thought he was the one who touched me. I even glared at him when I got off, but he just kept staring at his phone!"

Zoey rewound the footage and watched it again.

"Do you remember what the younger guy looked like? Can you describe him?" Zoey asked.

"Um," Ella thought hard. "He looked pretty average, you know, two eyes, a nose, two ears." She was really trying to recall.

But she couldn't come up with anything better.

Zoey's head was about to explode from Ella's vague description.

She took a deep breath and said, "Wow, good description!"

Ella chuckled, "Thanks."

Zoey said seriously, "I wasn't complimenting you."

Ella went quiet.

Zoey continued, "When he harassed you, do you remember which hand he used?"

Ella hesitated, feeling a bit embarrassed. After a moment, she said, "His hand was near my thigh at first. I thought it was just because of the crowd, so I didn't say anything. But then he grabbed half of my butt."

She still felt the shame.

Zoey asked, "Left hand or right hand?"

Ella sighed, "I really don't know, Officer Brown. I've never dealt with something like this before. I don't like physical contact with others... I'm pretty insecure and think I'm not good-looking. When this happened, I didn't even dare to ask for help."

###chapter 15

She was scared of being laughed at and dreaded the others' mocking looks.

She was even more terrified that folks would say, "How can someone as ugly as her claim she was sexually harassed?"

But now she got the courage to tell Zoey, "He touched me twice, so I quickly moved to the side... I was so freaked out that I got off the bus before my stop. But thinking about it, his hand shouldn't be that big."

Zoey was puzzled. "What do you mean?"

Ella explained, "My butt isn't that big, but he couldn't even grab it with one hand."

Zoey was quiet for a moment. She got the gist and said goodbye to Ella, "Alright, that's it. If I need anything else, I'll call you."

Just as she was about to hang up, Ella quickly asked, "Officer Brown, what are you going to do about the guy who was stalking me?"

Zoey replied, "We'll figure it out once we have more info. I'll let you know as soon as we do."

Ella said, "Alright, thank you, Officer Brown."

Zoey ended the call and turned back to the surveillance footage. This time, Charles had swapped the video for her.

Charles said, "Take a look at this."

Zoey looked closely at the footage again. There were still a lot of people in the video, but this one was a bit clearer than the last.

However, the guys standing next to the two victims weren't the ones Zoey had in mind. Nor were they the two men next to Ella.

Dennis had checked all the footage from the escalators. Since it was an escalator, the surveillance mostly captured wide-angle shots, making the people look really small.

At a glance, he felt like cursing. He irritably lit a cigarette and tapped the table. "Charles, hurry up!"

Charles came to help Dennis, and under Dennis's pressure, he quickly identified the victims.

"Is it her?" Charles scrutinized the footage and calmly analyzed it, "I get the feeling that these individuals who have been harassing others aren't the same person." The most certain point was that it definitely wasn't the Lawrence they apprehended.

Zoey actually felt the same way.

In other words, they had no way to prove that the victims they were investigating were connected to Lawrence. Nor could they prove that these harassment cases weren't just coincidences.

Zoey stared intently at the footage, lost in thought. Charles, seeing Zoey like this, thought she felt guilty for mobilizing so many officers for nothing.

He comforted her, "It's okay, Zoey. We've already sent all the evidence we found at Lawrence's house for DNA testing. In our line of work, we know that sometimes even what we see can't be trusted. We have to believe in science. What if the comparisons match?"

Zoey nodded while looking at the footage.

Alexander was specifically investigating Aria. She had joined a hiking group she found online and was sexually harassed during the hike. It happened to be a weekend, so the number of hikers was three to four times the usual.

The surveillance in the scenic area was spotty at best. Plus, it was a hiking trail, so there weren't many places where cameras could catch anything, making the investigation tougher. The angles were incomplete, making it impossible to piece together a continuous surveillance record.

Aria had found the hiking group online and didn't know much about them. As they started hiking, some people moved faster while others lagged behind. The report was made when they were near the top of the mountain.

This info was practically useless, making evidence gathering super difficult.

Alexander spent over half an hour searching for Aria. When he finally found her, she disappeared into a blind spot in the surveillance just a few minutes later. She reappeared three hours later, coming down the mountain with a female online friend, supporting each other.

Aria had been sexually harassed near the top of the mountain.

In the footage, she was already coming down.

After watching hours of surveillance, he got nothing useful!

Alexander's patience was wearing thin, and he had lost his smile.

He started speeding up the video, trying to spot Lawrence in the crowd, but after several viewings, he saw no sign of Lawrence, and his eyes were sore.

He overheard Charles and Zoey's conversation. All the evidence formed a closed loop at this moment. Was Zoey's initial hypothesis wrong? Impossible!

Alexander believed in Zoey's reasoning even more than she did.

He had seen Zoey's brilliance countless times. He believed that if Zoey worked in the criminal investigation department, no matter how complex the case, there would undoubtedly be a breakthrough with her involved.

Despite having suffered setbacks at her hands before, Alexander inexplicably harbored a profound sense of trust in her.

Just as Alexander was wondering whether to continue investigating, a familiar figure suddenly appeared in the surveillance footage! A woman appeared in full hiking gear, looking like a regular hiker.

Although she had her back to the camera, she occasionally glanced around before continuing up the mountain with the crowd. In no time, she disappeared into a blind spot.

Alexander watched several more times before pausing the video.

He waved to Charles, "Charles, look! Isn't this Lily?"

Everyone turned to look at Alexander.

Charles quickly moved to Alexander's position and began comparing the paused surveillance footage in his mind. "Although we can't see her face clearly, her profile and long hair almost confirm her identity. She is Lily!"

Zoey thought for a moment and then gestured a 0.4-inch width with her hand. She said, "Lily and Aria went missing nearly four months apart. Her hair should have grown this much."

Dennis was even more confused, "What does this all mean? If Lily wasn't missing, why didn't she contact her family? Why didn't she go home? How can you be sure Aria is Lily just because of her hair color?"

He felt genuinely frustrated. Since when did their police work rely on gut feelings?

Alexander, however, remained calm. "Dennis, did you go to Lily's home?"

Dennis replied, "Lily came here from out of town for work. We investigated her place and found nothing unusual. The room deposit was refunded to her family, and the place has long been rented out again."

###chapter 16

Alexander said, "But Lily's background is pretty simple. She doesn't owe anyone money, and all her friends and family say she's a polite kid. She comes from a regular family, and her parents are good people. She shouldn't have any enemies.

He added, "But I'm really curious, if you think this person is Lily, why hasn't she gone home? Why isn't she answering her parents' calls?" From the surveillance video, it didn't look like she was being forced.

Why would a perfectly normal girl just vanish?

At this moment, Alexander hit the pause button again, freezing the screen where Lily was looking around.

From her profile, it seemed like she noticed something. Then she took off her mask, showing her face.

Alexander said, "I remember in the case file, there were notes about Lily and her photos; she didn't usually wear hats. But in the surveillance, she's dressed like this, clearly trying not to be recognized, or maybe avoiding something?"

A scene flashed in Zoey's mind. She quickly went back to her notebook and started the surveillance from the beginning, from when Ella first got on the bus.

She focused on a woman standing next to Ella-she was facing the camera, wearing a plain coat, a hat, and a mask. In that scene, she even looked down at her phone, making it impossible to see her face.

The only thing that stood out was her nice long hair, which was pressed against her chest from the back.

In the surveillance video, when Ella realized she was being harassed, she first looked at those two men!

At that moment, the woman with the hat also seemed to glance at Ella. But her head movement was so slight, she still couldn't see her face.

Zoey followed the video and saw that when Ella got off the bus, the woman got off too.

She confirmed that the woman wasn't Lily. This woman's hair was a bit shorter than Lily's, and the texture was different.

Other than that, there wasn't much else. She had an average build, and her height was similar to Ella's. But this woman gave Zoey an indescribable feeling.

Yet Zoey still suspected her, even without any evidence.

Zoey went back to Alexander's computer, grabbed the mouse from his hand, and controlled the speed and progress of the surveillance. Soon, the woman with the hat and mask appeared again!

In the transition from winter to spring in Emerald City, everyone was wearing similar coats. That woman with red hair covering her coat looked a bit bulky.

The victim arrived at the station, got off quickly, and then the red-haired woman followed.

Zoey paused the surveillance again and went to check Dennis's. She went through it from start to finish at the same speed, but Dennis's surveillance was really hard to watch and she couldn't stand it.

After watching for a bit, she took a screenshot.

Then she handed Dennis's notebook back to him.

Zoey laid out the screenshots from the surveillance, comparing them one by one, and turned to the others. She said, "I've found something interesting and have some thoughts."

Dennis and Charles both looked at her, waiting for her to continue.

Alexander said, "Go on." He was curious too.

Zoey uploaded her findings to her laptop, playing the three screenshots in a slideshow. "Look, this is what I just found. Do you notice something? The victims' builds are almost the same, all around 5.5 feet; they are all very slim women."

"I found the woman next to Ella on the bus where she was harassed, and Alexander found Lily at the place where Aria was harassed. At first glance, their outfits blend into the crowd, but..." The slideshow showed another photo. She looked at it and asked, "Do you notice anything? They are not just similar; even their hair is the same."

"Oh my god!" Charles's eyes widened. "Could she be Lily pretending to be missing?"

Zoey just glanced at him and silently pulled up another picture. "Look, when Stella was harassed, this woman was also there! She was around the victim and even followed her for a while."

Because Stella was disabled and had difficulty walking, Zoey observed more carefully.

After Dennis watched, his expression became serious. "This is indeed a discovery."

Charles looked at everyone in confusion. "So what does it mean?"

Dennis sighed and patted his shoulder. "It means all the victims are connected! You really are slow, no wonder Officer Davis calls you an idiot!"

Charles still didn't get it.

Dennis continued, "Zoey means, it's highly likely that the person causing the victims to be harassed is the previous victim!"

Zoey quickly waved her hand. "No, that's not what I meant."

Dennis looked at her, puzzled.

Dennis and Charles were both confused. Alexander smiled slightly. "Zoey means, Lawrence isn't very tall, and his build is small for a man. If he disguises himself a bit, he could actually look like a woman."

Alexander's fingers tapped the laptop screen. "See? Every action he takes is to hide his male attributes. Lowering his head hides his Adam's apple, and long hair makes us think he's a woman. At a glance, we wouldn't suspect him."

He added, "In other words, even at the scene, it would be hard to suspect him. And what Zoey wants to tell you is, these people are all Lawrence in disguise!"

Zoey's gaze slowly fell on Alexander.

Only Alexander's thinking was on the same wavelength as hers.

After hearing his clear explanation, Dennis also understood. "So, if we hadn't caught Lawrence, he would have kept disguising himself as a woman and looking for the next target? His counter-surveillance skills are too good."

###chapter 17

Dennis let out a heavy sigh, "Man, such a pervert!"

As a veteran investigator, this angle hadn't even crossed his mind.

But Charles wasn't buying Zoey's theory. "I trust my eyes. Your logic makes sense, but your claim doesn't add up. These photos look alike, but the hair seems too real to be fake."

Zoey didn't mind Charles's skepticism; she appreciated the challenge.

Debates like these were crucial among colleagues.

"Charles, I never said the hair was fake," Zoey clarified calmly.

Charles's eyes widened with sudden realization, fear creeping in.

Dennis felt a chill too. Zoey's theory, though wild, wasn't impossible.

So he said, "Yeah, Zoey's got a point. We found someone living in the guest room at his place. These women all seem connected to one person. If Lawrence killed someone and made a wig from their hair, it wouldn't be that hard."

Dennis's face grew serious. "I need to go tell Officer Davis about this."

He grabbed the files and headed out.

After a few steps, he paused. "Wait, who's gonna talk to Lawrence's family or friends?"

Zoey volunteered, and Alexander quickly chimed in.

Dennis nodded at them, "Alright, you two handle it."

"Got it," Alexander agreed, gathering the files and discussing the plan with Zoey.

Lawrence ran his own supermarket, mostly dealing with his employees.

Since Lawrence's case hadn't turned criminal yet, getting the employees to spill any dirt on him was tricky.

Zoey was already in the car, eyes closed, catching a quick nap.

Alexander hopped into the driver's seat, chuckling at Zoey's ability to sleep anywhere.

An hour and a half later, they pulled up to Lawrence's supermarket.

Even without Lawrence, his employees were hard at work.

"Didn't think Lawrence's little supermarket would be this busy," Alexander remarked, eyeing the bustling store.

It was after work hours, and the place was packed.

Alexander unbuckled and stepped out.

Zoey followed suit.

They walked in with the crowd, greeted by a friendly employee, "Welcome! Need any help?"

"Actually, we do," Alexander replied.

A female employee smiled, "What can I assist you with?"

"We need to talk about your boss," he flashed his badge.

The employee's face changed. To avoid a scene, she suggested, "It's pretty busy right now. Could you wait upstairs? I'll get our supervisor."

Alexander nodded, "Sure thing."

The female employee directed them, "Head to the second floor, first room on the left."

"Thanks." To keep things smooth, Alexander and Zoey made their way upstairs.

The first room on the left was easy to spot; there were only four rooms up there, one being a storage room.

Zoey's instincts kicked in, and she slipped on disposable gloves to gather any potential evidence.

Alexander watched her, feeling the silence between them.

Since leaving the station, they hadn't exchanged a word.

Even when he tried to chat, Zoey barely responded.

It felt like she was keeping him at arm's length, which only made him more curious.

As Zoey carefully opened the door with her gloves, examining the office, Alexander asked, "Think we'll find anything here?"

Lawrence only visited a few times a month. What could they possibly find?

Zoey snapped, "None of your business!"

Alexander went quiet.

The desk was spotless, just like Lawrence's home.

Besides some office supplies, there was only a computer and a notebook.

Zoey checked each drawer, finding nothing but random items.

Hearing footsteps, she quickly removed her gloves and pocketed them.

A man in his thirties walked in, looking puzzled but polite. He sat on the guest sofa.

Zoey and Alexander exchanged glances, guessing he was the supervisor the employee mentioned.

Zoey flashed her badge, "Hello, Sir, you must've heard from your staff. We're here about Lawrence Parker."

"Please cooperate with our investigation," Alexander added, his tone firm.

The man eyed their badges, then them, skeptically. "You both look pretty young. Are you sure you're cops? Have you even graduated? And can women be cops?"

Zoey chuckled at his words. "What, women can't be cops?"

The man retorted, "Sorry, but with all the scams these days, I have the right to protect myself. You need to prove you're real cops!"

"Prove it?" Zoey was fuming.

Alexander patted her shoulder, calming her down, and showed the badge again, "Look closely! If we weren't cops, we wouldn't be here by ourselves. Or do you think it's fake because we came in person? I can also invite you to the station!"

###chapter 18

The guy heard Alexander and clammed up, not daring to say another word.

The man snapped, "Alright, hurry up and ask. We're about to clock out; don't waste my time."

Zoey's face darkened, her tone sharper. "You know Lawrence pretty well, don't you?"

She figured since Lawrence ran his own supermarket and made this guy the team leader, they must have some personal connection.

The man answered, "We're just boss and employee."

Alexander saw the guy's impatience and leaned in with a grin. "You know, your body language says a lot. You act indifferent, but deep down, you must really hate Lawrence. Spill it."

He seemed to read the guy like a book.

The guy got more agitated but hid it well. "You're wrong. Why would I hate him? I've never said anything like that."

Alexander was about to retort, but Zoey jumped in first. "A guy like him, being a useless team leader at his age, is still so full of himself. He thinks we're beneath him, only caring about his image. What can we get from him? Let's not waste our time."

She stood up and mocked him, "Wow, team leader of a supermarket, huh? Impressive."

Alexander couldn't help but mentally give Zoey a thumbs up.

The guy suddenly stood up, fuming. "What are you saying?"

He raised his voice, catching the attention of a janitor passing by.

The janitor peeked in and asked, "Everything okay?"

The guy nodded, signaling the janitor to leave.

Once the door closed, he realized he'd lost his cool and glared at Zoey. "You know what? You asked the right person! Why did I say I wasn't close to Lawrence? Because it's embarrassing to know him! He's a freak, bringing women's wigs and clothes every day. Is that normal? We're all guys here; we get that everyone has their quirks. If he brought a blow-up doll, fine, but those things? I can't stand it!"

He started ranting about Lawrence, and Alexander quickly took notes.

Zoey and Alexander were in sync.

She calmly asked, "How many times have you seen this?"

The guy, still annoyed by Lawrence's behavior, replied with emotion, "Too many times! It's just the two of us in the office every day; I see everything he does. I have to pretend not to notice because I work for him. But yeah, he's definitely a pervert. So I'm not surprised you're asking about him."

Alexander asked, "Besides you, is Lawrence close to anyone else?"

The guy scoffed, "I don't know, and let me make it clear again, he's not close to me! He's so cheap he brings his own lunch from home. It's gross, like he's some kind of housewife."

Alexander pressed on, "When does he usually leave here?"

The guy replied, "He's the boss, so he leaves right after work. He won't stay a second longer, leaving all the dirty work to us!"

His words dripped with disdain for Lawrence.

Alexander and Zoey asked a few more questions, but it was clear they weren't getting much more, so they wrapped it up.

Alexander said, "Thanks for your cooperation."

The guy puffed up, "You should, only I can give you this info. No one else deals with him!" He turned to see them out, then paused. "By the way, what did Lawrence do?"

Alexander replied politely, "Sorry, we can't disclose that."

The guy huffed, "So you use me and then toss me aside? Fine!"

Alexander felt a surge of irritation.

Zoey, not wanting to waste more time, glanced at Alexander. "Are we done here?"

Alexander nodded, "Yeah."

"Then let's go." Zoey and Alexander were both interns, but she acted like she was in charge.

Alexander didn't mind the details.

As they stepped out, Zoey's voice cut through the air. "For the first time, I get why emotional intelligence matters. If a teenager talked like this, I'd get it. But you're in your thirties and still act like this? No wonder you're just a team leader. From the half-hour I've spent with you, I see why you haven't gotten further."

Alexander was so mad he pointed at Zoey. "Say that again!"

"Didn't I make myself clear? Is it that you don't like hearing the truth, or you can't face it?" Zoey didn't hold back, making Alexander feel a bit satisfied.

Zoey added, "And if you insult me again, I can arrest you for insulting a police officer!"

Hearing this, the guy's arrogance deflated. "I gave you all the info I had, and this is how you treat me?"

Zoey blinked innocently. "What did I do? I didn't curse or hit you. I just told you the truth. Why are you so hostile? Maybe you should look at yourself."

Alexander paused, wanting to hear more.

Zoey's tone was calm, even smiling, as she scolded the guy.

His face darkened with anger.

He glared at Zoey, "I'm gonna teach you a lesson today!"

"What do you think you're doing?" Alexander reacted quickly, intercepting the guy's hand mid-air, his tall frame shielding Zoey.

###chapter 19

Alexander grinned, "You've been a huge help with our case. The police will definitely reward you. Thanks for being such a cooperative citizen. Can you double-check the info you gave us?"

Seeing Alexander's friendly face, the guy's anger cooled off a bit.

Even though Zoey's words had ticked him off, she had a point: if he lost it now, he'd be in trouble for assaulting an officer.

And that was exactly what Zoey wanted, to get him locked up by his own doing?

No way! He grudgingly sat back down.

Alexander shot Zoey a look, and she knew he was trying to back her up. She gave him a quick glance and left the office.

Zoey headed down to the first floor.

There weren't as many customers now, so the few employees stocking shelves weren't as busy.

Zoey spotted a girl in a work uniform and walked over, flashing her badge. "Hey, can I ask you a few questions?"

The girl had her hair tied up and looked pretty efficient. "Sure, what do you need to know?"

Zoey nodded. "Alright."

Thinking this wasn't the best place to chat, Zoey asked the girl to go somewhere else with her.

The employee led her to the changing room on the first floor.

"Let's talk here," the employee said. "No one usually comes here until it's time to clock out."

Zoey glanced around the changing room and nodded. "Okay, let's start."

"Sure."

"How long have you been working here? What's your take on Lawrence? Noticed anything odd about him?"

The girl thought for a moment. "He's super tidy and never says anything that makes us uncomfortable. Plus, he can cook, which is pretty rare for single guys. I think he's awesome!"

Even though her info was different from the guy's, it was clear she liked clean, cooking-loving men.

Zoey dug deeper. "Are you close with him?"

"Not really. Besides the Monday meetings, we just have normal boss-employee chats. I like that he doesn't make inappropriate jokes. It makes us all feel comfortable."

Zoey nodded. "Got it." This was definitely different from what the guy had said.

No wonder they said women didn't understand men; only men got men.

Zoey asked, "Lawrence seems great to you. How do you feel about the way he assigns tasks?"

"I think it's fine. He's the boss, and he always gives us detailed notes. He's serious about his work."

Zoey could tell that if she asked more, the girl would start gushing about him.

She switched gears. "Did you know he likes to wear women's clothes in private?"

"Wear women's clothes?" The girl looked shocked. "A colleague mentioned it once, but I thought it was a joke. Someone as great as him couldn't do that."

She quickly added, "Even if he does, so what? You can't arrest him just because he has a different hobby."

Zoey figured there was no point in dragging the conversation on. She thanked the woman with a smile and left.

The woman, worried that Lawrence might be in trouble, hesitated and asked, "Is Lawrence in some kind of trouble? If it's not too much to ask."

Zoey replied firmly, "It's not something I can discuss."

Zoey met up with Alexander at the door, and they headed back to the car together.

She yawned, planning to catch a nap in the passenger seat, but an annoying voice interrupted her. "You've been at the police department for so long, and you haven't changed a bit?"

Zoey shot back, "And how exactly do my changes concern you?"

Alexander wasn't thrilled with Zoey's attitude today. They were cops, and the person they were dealing with could be a key witness. No matter how irritating, Zoey couldn't just do whatever she wanted.

Alexander said, "You just joined the criminal investigation department. Don't you want to make a good impression on Officer Davis? Aren't you worried about getting reported?"

Zoey shrugged. "Let them report me."

"You don't seem to care about anything; don't you want to stay in the criminal investigation department?" Alexander was at a loss with Zoey.

She was too reckless. It would catch up with her eventually.

Zoey, on the other hand, had already turned away, not wanting to deal with him.

Alexander looked at her lazy profile. Every time he tried to help her, she always acted indifferent.

A thought suddenly crossed his mind. "Do you not want to be a cop anymore?"

Zoey was fed up with Alexander's nagging. "Are you meddling too much? Whether I want to be a cop or not is none of your business."

Alexander remembered how Zoey had snapped at that guy earlier, took a deep breath, and silently pulled the car over.

Zoey felt the car stop and slowly opened her eyes, looking in Alexander's direction.

"We went through so much at the police academy. Are you serious?" Alexander stared ahead, clearly pissed. "You always wanted to compete the best with me. But what's the point now? Do you even know what you're saying?"

Zoey was beyond frustrated, and anger surged through her. She stared at him for a while, and as Alexander got more worked up and looked back at her, she sneered.

"Compete? You think too highly of me. You come from a privileged background; our starting lines aren't even close. What am I competing with you for? The word 'compete' doesn't even apply to us. Competing is for people on the same level, right?"

Zoey let out a cold laugh and continued, "Maybe in your world, you can't understand that the high tuition fees of the police academy can crush a family because you've never experienced the hardships of the lower class. When you think I'm 'competing' with you, I'm actually 'competing' with my fate! All my efforts are to earn scholarships every year so I can afford to go to school and sit in that classroom."

###chapter 20

Alexander felt pretty shaken up inside by Zoey's words.

Back in their police academy days, he thought he'd found a kindred spirit. They were on the same wavelength, always bouncing ideas off each other. He dove deep into those cases, analyzing every detail, all because of her.

But it was all in his head.

Zoey never saw him as a rival. To her, it was all about the scholarship, and he was just the biggest obstacle in her way.

Alexander couldn't even describe how he felt right now. It was worse than a desperate counterattack. He was heartbroken.

He took a deep breath and asked, "The police academy's tuition is higher than regular schools. With your smarts, you could've gone anywhere. Why insist on the police academy?"

Zoey rolled her eyes, "What's it to you?"

Alexander fell silent. She didn't care about anything he said.

Zoey turned back to the car window, "Are we going back or not? If you don't, I'll tell Officer Davis you're slacking off!"

Alexander was speechless. He had no way to deal with Zoey.

He restarted the car, and they drove back in silence.

At the police station, Dennis and Charles immediately surrounded them, eager for updates. "How'd it go?"

Alexander said, "We went to Lawrence's supermarket and talked to the lower-level employees and their team leader. Aside from their personal opinions of Lawrence, almost everyone knew he liked to bring women's clothes and wigs to work. This pretty much confirms our suspicions about Lawrence!"

Dennis nodded excitedly, admiration flashing in his eyes as he looked at Zoey, "Great work. I've got something even better! Remember the bloodstain in the bathroom? It's confirmed to be from the missing Lily!"

But then he sighed. "However, the long hair Alexander found under the mirror doesn't match any of our suspected victims. It's not from any of the three women."

This suggested there might be a fourth victim they hadn't found yet. They needed to expand the search, but they still didn't know where to start.

Expanding the search from three months of missing women to six months would require a lot of police resources.

Not to mention those, what if the family of the owner of the long hair hadn't reported her missing?

At that moment, Robert joined the discussion, "Lawrence is a clean freak. He even bought a robot vacuum to keep his place spotless. Do you think he wouldn't clean under the mirror? We saw the long hair right away. Wouldn't Lawrence see it? I told you it wasn't necessary to bring it back, but you insisted."

"How is it not necessary!" Charles only dared to talk to Robert like this when discussing the case, "Now we can confirm there's a fourth person, can't we?"

"Then go find the fourth person yourself. This task is all yours," Robert frowned, utterly speechless at Charles.

Charles knew this investigation was going to be a headache, so he picked up his phone and started searching for something.

The impromptu "meeting" wrapped up, and everyone went back to their tasks.

This was Zoey's first time in a discussion since her transfer, and she was so caught up in the heated atmosphere that it took her a moment to snap out of it.

Alexander noticed and chuckled, "You'll get used to it. They argue all the time, but it's no big deal."

Zoey ignored him and went back to her seat.

Alexander fell silent. Was he being ignored again?

Things were moving fast, and now they had both witnesses and physical evidence.

With the case shifting from stalking to a criminal investigation, Robert had Lawrence transferred from another station's holding cell to theirs for the next round of questioning.

Since Lawrence hadn't lived in his current place for long, he denied everything, "I don't know anything. It must've been left by the previous tenant. You guys are cops, but you can't just frame me, right?"

They were only holding Lawrence as a suspect for now, without much solid evidence. His constant denials were making the interrogation tough.

As long as Lawrence didn't confess, it remained a criminal case. No one was dumb enough to send themselves to prison.

Lawrence was sure they had no evidence; otherwise, they wouldn't need his confession.

Everyone looked pretty grim as they gathered again.

"Did you see Lawrence's attitude? Total provocation! He's sure we can't find the bodies, so he's playing games with us!" Robert slammed his fist on the table, "For now, there's no better way. We need to look for clues in the surveillance footage. You guys handle Lawrence's movements from three months ago. You and Zoey will cover the area around his current residence. Keep investigating and interviewing. Got it?"

Zoey nodded, "Got it!"

Lawrence's current place was in an old complex called Pleasantville Apartments. The surveillance was pretty lacking, making Zoey and Alexander's investigation and interviews a pain.

Thinking about the possibility that Lawrence might be responsible for more than just three lives, Zoey and Alexander were even more determined.

To avoid wasting time on evidence collection, they backed up all the surveillance footage they could find, even from nearby shops.

Zoey felt a bit hungry on the way and grabbed a hot dog.

Seeing her eat so heartily, Alexander couldn't help but comment, "You have a good appetite."

Alexander thought, 'In such a pressing situation, she still has time to eat.'

Zoey replied, "If I don't eat, how can I have enough energy?"

She quickly finished her food and got back to work.

As they returned to the station, Alexander suddenly stopped at the entrance, looking at Zoey seriously.

He said, "Lawrence doesn't have his own car. If he really is the serial killer, how did he transport these people without leaving any traces? Could it be dismemberment?"

###chapter 21

"Have you been watching too many detective movies? That's impossible," Zoey said, shaking her head firmly.

The room went dead silent.

Alexander was caught off guard by her words. They locked eyes for a few seconds before he let out a helpless smile. "Alright, then explain it to me."

Zoey wasn't a fan of discussing things with others; it usually messed with her train of thought.

But seeing how eager Alexander was, she decided to give him a little lesson. "Do you know why a dismembered body, if not chemically treated and just tossed in a trash bin, gets found so quickly? Remember that twenty years ago's infamous dismemberment case our police academy instructor told us about?"

Alexander watched her quietly; he had never really thought about it that way.

He usually focused on the killer's motives, the disposal sites, and the purpose of the murder. He never really considered why the body would be discovered, assuming it was always due to witnesses and not the killer's actions.

"Why?" Alexander asked, genuinely curious.

Zoey replied, "Because you don't understand us regular people."

Alexander looked puzzled.

Zoey gave a self-deprecating smile.

"Zoey, this isn't the time for jokes," Alexander said, still serious.

Zoey felt a bit satisfied seeing his serious face. "I'm not joking. We haven't implemented strict garbage sorting here yet, so sanitation workers or garbage collectors don't usually check the contents of the garbage bags when cleaning up."

Alexander nodded. "Yeah, that's true."

Zoey found his naivety endearing. "That's why I said you don't get how us ordinary people live! If it were you, you wouldn't look inside the garbage bags. You'd probably find it gross and throw away the gloves you used to take out the trash."

She could tell by the look in his eyes that he would definitely do that.

Being wealthy, he didn't care about the cost of a pair of gloves and would never bother washing and reusing them.

Zoey continued, "That's just the mindset of you rich folks. The reality is, people willing to do such dirty and tiring work are usually older folks with kids who don't make much money. They don't want to burden their kids and don't have any special skills, so they take up this job. They go through the garbage looking for anything they can use, even if it's a beat-up jacket or something that can be reused, just to save a few bucks."

She went on, "Remember when we drove back from Pleasantville Apartments? You saw those elderly people rummaging through the trash bins, right? The person who reported the dismemberment case found a lot of meat in the garbage bag, thought it wasn't spoiled, and wanted to take it home to eat. But when they checked the meat at home, they found a few fingers."

With that, Zoey smirked and raised an eyebrow at Alexander.

Alexander took a deep breath. These were definitely things he hadn't considered. Was it really his wealth that made him overlook such details?

Alexander said, "I gotta admit, there's no flaw in your logic."

Zoey took his words as him trying to save face and didn't push it further. She'd been competing with Alexander since their school days and knew his level well.

Overall, she wasn't as good as him.

But Alexander had his blind spots. What gave her an edge was her background. Growing up poor gave her a deep understanding of how regular folks lived, letting her grasp the general public's mindset better.

Zoey shrugged, "This isn't really about logic. It's just everyday life. Rich people are the minority; most folks aren't wealthy."

Thanks to Zoey's little lesson, Alexander finally quieted down.

They grabbed a quick bite in the police station's cafeteria and then got back to watching surveillance footage.

There weren't many cameras at Pleasantville Apartments, but the key entrances and exits were covered.

Both vehicles and people coming and going were captured clearly enough, and with these two cameras, they could get some useful info.

Zoey and Alexander split up the footage, each taking half to review.

It took them three to four hours to get through all of it.

Zoey's eyes were sore, and her body ached. She stretched but still found no loopholes in the footage.

In the past few months, Lawrence never took anything with him when he went out, except for the occasional bag, which was undoubtedly for women's clothing.

From the rented apartment where Lawrence lived, the living traces and some evidence indicated that at least two victims had stayed there, but they found no bodies in Lawrence's home.

What did this mean? He had disposed of at least two bodies in three months.

From the surveillance footage that captured the trash bins, Lawrence threw out the garbage every two to three days, and the garbage didn't seem to weigh as much as containing bodies.

Moreover, the black plastic bags he carried were just ordinary plastic bags, nothing special.

The problem that puzzled both Alexander and Zoey was the same: since he didn't dismember the bodies, where were the victims' bodies?

Time flew by as they worked from the afternoon into the evening.

Robert saw everyone with dark circles under their eyes because of Lawrence's case and patted the table to get their attention. "This case is a tough nut to crack, and you've all been working hard, but you need to take care of yourselves. You need enough sleep to think clearly. Let's call it a night!"

In the past, everyone would have rushed to compete with the suspects.

But recently, with no solid evidence, they had been stuck watching surveillance footage every day.

They definitely needed some rest.

Everyone said goodbye to Robert one by one and left the police station.

Charles saw Zoey's tired look and called out to her, "Zoey, you okay? Need a ride?"

Alexander immediately added, "Take my car, Zoey."

Zoey thanked them for their kindness. "No need, it's close by, just a few steps away."

###chapter 22

Alexander said, "Alright, be careful and shoot us a text when you get there."

Zoey didn't look back, just waved goodbye.

Alexander and Charles watched Zoey disappear before heading home.

Back at her dorm, Zoey crashed the moment she hit the bed.

She must've been wiped out because she slept like a log and even overslept the next morning.

The women's dorm was just a hop, skip, and a jump from the criminal investigation department. Plus, they could snag a free breakfast with an employee ID.

Zoey quickly got ready and headed to the police station. She planned to hit the cafeteria but realized she didn't have an employee ID.

The past few days, Robert had been her ticket in, but today she was early and didn't see anyone she knew.

What now? Her stomach growled. She was starving!

Zoey looked up at the clear blue sky, and then at the neatly trimmed bushes leading to the cafeteria. Her mood lifted a bit.

She thought about grabbing some snacks outside, but just as she was about to leave, she spotted a familiar figure-Alexander.

Alexander, holding a coffee, dressed casually and looked neat and clean. He walked leisurely, eyes glued to his phone.

Alexander glanced up and instantly saw Zoey.

"You're early today," he said.

"Yeah, I got up early," Zoey replied, surprisingly gentle compared to her usual self.

Her gentleness caught Alexander off guard-usually, she'd either give him a disdainful look or ignore him. What was up today?

While Alexander was still puzzled by Zoey's sudden change, she asked, "Had breakfast yet?"

For the first time, her eyes were on him without any hint of aggression.

Alexander paused but quickly caught on.

Considering Zoey's sudden friendliness, she probably wanted to eat but couldn't get into the cafeteria.

Though both were interns, Alexander was officially affiliated with the police station and had all the necessary credentials, unlike Zoey.

"No, I haven't," Alexander lied, but he didn't expose Zoey. He smiled and nodded towards the cafeteria, "Together?"

"Sure," Zoey said, looking satisfied.

Her eyes sparkled with a gentle smile.

Alexander couldn't help but chuckle. Who would've thought Zoey would ask for help?

Even though her way of asking was unique, Alexander figured this was Zoey's biggest concession.

They walked side by side into the cafeteria. After Alexander swiped his card, they found an empty seat.

Zoey ordered a ton of food, leaving Alexander stunned.

He instantly regretted sitting with her.

Zoey ate with gusto, finishing half the food in no time.

Alexander mentally gave her a thumbs up.

Zoey said, "By the way, when I was going through the case files this morning, I found..."

Alexander raised his hand to stop her, "Let's talk about the case later; finish your meal first."

Zoey rolled her eyes at him.

Soon, they finished their meal and headed back to the station.

Zoey had a great night's sleep and realized that getting enough rest really did wonders for her mind. She felt super alert now.

With her mind clear, she went over the case files again and found some stuff she missed before.

"Alexander," Zoey said, "I looked over the tables we made last night and noticed that Lawrence almost never left his house on weekends for three months."

Alexander had seen it too, but he had his own take on it. "Lawrence usually avoids people, so it's not surprising he doesn't go out to socialize," he said.

Zoey asked, "Not cleaning his house or taking out the trash for four days straight is normal too?"

That was just impossible. He had to eat at least twice a day.

Not going out meant he had to cook at home, and the kitchen trash would pile up in a few days.

Forgetting to take out the trash on Monday morning was one thing, but what about Tuesday?

Thinking this way, there had to be something off during this period!

Alexander started recalling the surveillance records he reviewed last night. Lawrence's trash disposal times were mostly on Wednesdays and Fridays. Thinking it over, he really hadn't taken out the trash on weekends or Mondays.

Even if he took out the trash on the previous Thursday, the next chance wouldn't be until the following Tuesday, leaving a four-day gap.

Lawrence, who was meticulous about preparing his own meals and loved cleanliness, would find it unbearable if his home was filled with the stench of three days' worth of kitchen trash.

It made sense that there was less trash on workdays. But according to Lawrence's trash bags, why was there less trash on weekends?

Alexander started to piece it together, "There are no surveillance cameras near the garbage collection station. We only saw him taking out the trash through other cameras, so this is a blind spot. Sometimes, missing some details is normal. But I believe a person's living habits don't change easily. The trash generated while staying at home on weekends should be much more than on workdays."

Zoey seriously continued his thought, "Unless... he took out the trash on one of the weekend days, which contradicts his habit of staying home. So, he must have gone out on weekends! He must go out in a way that we couldn't detect."

"The underground parking lot!" Alexander's tone had a hint of excitement, "The only place he could leave without leaving evidence on surveillance is there!"

"We've already looked into Lawrence's background. Even though he's a supermarket owner, the supermarket isn't big, and the profits aren't much. It's not enough for him to afford a car," Zoey thought for a moment and continued, "But we can't rule out the possibility that Lawrence has other ways to make money." She emphasized, "Stealing!"

Lawrence was very likely stealing someone else's car.

Zoey and Alexander almost thought of the same thing.

Thinking of this, Zoey and Alexander had already entered the police station. Zoey said, "Looks like we have more work today! We need to check all the vehicles that entered and exited on weekends since Lawrence moved in."

Alexander said, "Alright, I'll let Dennis and Charles know later."

###chapter 23

"Yes!" Zoey's voice perked up. She finally saw the light and felt pretty good about it.

She rarely smiled, but when she did, her beautiful eyes caught Alexander's attention.

It wasn't until Zoey walked past him that he snapped out of it.

Everything clicked, and their team dove back into monitoring the surveillance footage. Besides taking care of the basics, they spent almost the whole day glued to the video screens.

They logged every car that passed by on Friday morning, then pooled their counts, and started sorting the data based on the owner's real name and whether they lived in the community.

Zoey managed to compile three months' worth of license plate numbers in just one morning.

Zoey called out a license plate number and asked Alexander, who was handling the data for the back gate, "Has this car gone out?"

Alexander had a spreadsheet ready to make the search easier.

He typed in the number and clicked the mouse.

"Nope," Alexander said. "Report its movements."

Zoey reported seriously, "This car is kinda interesting. It comes in around 8:30 PM every Friday and leaves at the same time on Sunday night. For three months straight, it was like clockwork. But after we nabbed Lawrence, it just stopped showing up at Pleasantville Apartments."

"It's been about two weeks since we caught Lawrence, and this car hasn't shown up for two weeks?" Alexander stretched an arm and relaxed a bit. "Hold on, I'll contact the DMV right now! You compare notes with Dennis and the others to see if there are any other suspicious vehicles."

"Got it," Zoey replied.

Alexander and Zoey's team was making quick progress, while Charles and Dennis's team was lagging a bit.

Their job wasn't just about compiling surveillance data; it was way more complicated.

Dennis's bad temper was about to blow.

Dennis shouted, "Lawrence, I just wanna go in and beat him up right now!"

Charles was getting more confused as he compiled the data, and his head started to hurt. Just then, Zoey came over.

Seeing their tired faces, she pretty much guessed what was up.

She offered some comfort, "You guys okay?"

Charles said, "We're fine."

Zoey filled Charles and Dennis in on all the info she and Alexander had gathered. Knowing they had a lead, they got excited and kept compiling data to find more clues.

Around 3 PM, the DMV called.

To share the info with everyone, Alexander put the call on speaker, "Officer Edwards, we checked the license plate you gave us. It's fake. This car is definitely suspicious."

Zoey had already guessed this, so the result didn't surprise her at all.

She stretched lazily and said, "Let's keep digging."

To make future investigations easier, Zoey had meticulously recorded the exact times each car entered or exited.

So it was clear that the suspicious car left at 8:43 PM. Based on its speed at the time, they started figuring out where it might have gone.

Along the way, there were mostly small convenience stores, and the few owners with surveillance cameras weren't too keen on cooperating.

They said they were just small businesses; if the cops showed up, it would hurt their reputation.

Zoey had to explain to each one that she just needed their surveillance footage.

Zoey and Alexander, though speechless, kept trying to convince the store owners to cooperate, but only a few did. It was super frustrating!

Zoey and Alexander worked all day and finally found a car at an abandoned factory near the outskirts around 11 PM.

Seeing the car, Alexander's fatigue vanished! This was it! They had finally found it.

He immediately called Robert to share the news.

Robert, yawning continuously, said, "Alexander, the tech department is off work at this hour. You'll have to wait there. I've already sent a message to the tech team. They'll come over first thing in the morning. But tonight, you'll have to guard the evidence yourselves."

"Alright, that's all we can do." Alexander hung up and put his phone back in his pocket.

As winter approached in Emerald City, the temperature difference between day and night was significant, and it was particularly cold.

Since they were near the outskirts, there were few buildings, and apart from vast fields, there were hardly any houses in sight; only the occasional honk of a car could be heard from the road.

"Are you cold?" Alexander took off his coat to give to Zoey.

Zoey didn't take the coat he offered but instead reached for her bag.

Alexander hung the coat on his arm and watched as she took out two pieces of bread from her bag!

Zoey noticed Alexander watching her out of the corner of her eye. Thinking about how they had been busy all day, she split one piece of bread for herself and held the other out to him. "Want some?"

Alexander usually disliked eating these processed foods because they had too many additives.

But today's bread was from Zoey, so he inexplicably took it and even felt a bit happy.

"Sure." Alexander took the bread. He wanted to say thank you, but then he paused as he saw Zoey taking big bites of her bread.

It was cold outside, so they went back to the car.

They had finished the last bottle of water in the trunk that afternoon.

Alexander was worried she might choke and kept reminding her, "Slow down; no one's going to take it from you."

Soon, she finished the dry bread.

Alexander knew Zoey's appetite well, and one piece of bread wouldn't be enough to fill her up.

Alexander wasn't hungry initially, but seeing her eat so heartily made him hungry too.

Zoey tried to avoid snatching the bread from Alexander's hand by closing her eyes and not looking at him.

She thought, 'Sleep, if I fall asleep, I won't be hungry.'

Seeing her like this, Alexander found her adorable and laughed, "What do you want to eat? I'll treat you to something good."

Zoey's arm had just lifted, intending to wave her hand in refusal.

Alexander added, "Consider it a thank you for the bread."

Zoey's outstretched arm immediately turned into a stretch smoothly.

She slowly opened her eyes, lazily sitting in the passenger seat, and praised, "You really know social manners, huh?"

Alexander was silent. Why did Zoey's thanks feel like sarcasm?

###chapter 24

Alexander pulled up the food delivery app on his phone and handed it to Zoey, telling her to order whatever she wanted.

Zoey just shrugged and said, "I'm good with anything; you pick."

Alexander took the phone back and nodded.

His long, attractive fingers tapped a few times on the screen, then he looked up and casually asked, "How about some hot cocoa?"

Zoey replied, "Never had it; plain water's fine."

Alexander's eyes widened in surprise. "Seriously? Don't all girls drink it every day?"

Zoey, confused, said, "I've just never tried hot cocoa; what's the big deal? I like plain water. Hot cocoa's pricey and not exactly healthy. Why spend money to feel crappy?"

Alexander went quiet.

Zoey just didn't see the point in spending a lot of money just to quench her thirst.

Alexander didn't push the topic and continued ordering food quietly.

He picked out some of her favorite dishes from their recent meals together and added two cups of hot cocoa for Zoey to try.

She thought it was expensive, so she didn't buy it. Since he bought it, she shouldn't mind, right?

Worried Zoey might not drink it, he also ordered two bottles of water.

The delivery guy had a tough time finding their location.

Alexander talked to him over the phone, giving directions, and they finally met up.

When Alexander got back to the car with a big bag of food, the car was soon filled with the delicious aroma.

"All set, let's eat," Alexander said, opening the food containers and handing Zoey her utensils.

Zoey didn't hold back and started eating right away.

She ate quickly, without any grace.

Alexander couldn't understand how she could eat so much.

Seeing him not eating, Zoey looked up and asked, "Why are you staring at me? Aren't you eating?"

"Yeah," Alexander said, picking up his utensils and starting to eat.

When Zoey had almost finished eating, Alexander carefully took out the hot cocoa he had bought for her.

He handed it to Zoey, "I got this for you."

Zoey felt a strange emotion she couldn't quite identify.

She took the hot cocoa from him and took a sip.

"It's pretty good; thanks for the meal," she said. Then she thought, 'No wonder it's so expensive.'

"It's nothing. We're colleagues; we should look out for each other," Alexander said. He found that he enjoyed her compliments more than he expected. He must be crazy!

After a while, both of them were full and slumped back in their seats.

Zoey felt a bit sleepy and wanted to close her eyes for a while.

She wanted to rest up and deal with things in the morning.

Alexander, in the driver's seat, couldn't sit still. He flipped through the case files repeatedly, looking for clues.

After a while, he got sleepy and took out his phone to find a nearby hotel for both of them.

He was surprised to find that the drive from here to downtown, and then from downtown to Pleasantville Apartments, took a full hour.

An idea suddenly popped into his head. He muttered, "If Lawrence drives out every weekend, how does he get back?"

They had almost worn out the surveillance tapes looking for Lawrence, but there was no footage of him returning to the apartment complex.

Zoey, though her eyes were closed, was also thinking about what Alexander had said.

The next second, she answered, "That's because he never came back."

Alexander asked, "You mean, besides Lawrence, there's someone else?"

Zoey was now uncertain; these were merely her conjectures. She slowly opened her eyes and said, "Do you recall passing a neighborhood closest to the suburbs?"

Alexander instantly got it. "Looks like we have more work tomorrow."

All night, they took turns keeping watch of the car, afraid that the evidence they had found would disappear.

At dawn, Robert finally arrived!

Robert came to their car window and knocked on the door.

Alexander and Zoey, having stayed up all night, looked tired as they rolled down the window to greet Robert, "Officer Davis, you're here."

Robert said, "Yes, the tech team has started working. You two must be exhausted; go get some rest."

Alexander and Zoey had more important things to do than rest. Zoey said, "We'll check the nearby apartment complex first, then we'll go back!"

Robert agreed, "Alright, call if you need help."

"Okay, I think Zoey and I can handle it," Alexander said, as it was just checking some surveillance footage.

After talking to Alexander, Robert went back to the warehouse.

Alexander and Zoey drove the car closer to the city. Since it was morning, there were many food vendors on the street.

They bought some food to fill their stomachs and headed to the apartment complex they had passed by earlier to check the surveillance.

But as soon as they arrived, the security guard stopped them. "Sorry, you're not residents here; please register."

Alexander parked the car and walked to the security office. Then he showed his badge and easily got the surveillance footage.

Zoey wanted information on all the residents, but the security guard said, "Officer, we've done all we can. Resident information is private, and without a warrant, we can't give it to you. We're just employees; we can't risk it."

Zoey thought this apartment complex was pretty good; it was at least better than Pleasantville Apartments.

If they found any clues in the future, they might get what they needed from the security office, making the investigation easier.

"Alright, thanks for your cooperation." Alexander understood. They didn't have solid evidence; otherwise, they wouldn't be here looking for it.

After more than an hour, Alexander and Zoey returned to the precinct.

Charles saw them and excitedly approached, "We found it! This suspicious car's movements match Lawrence's almost exactly! It goes back on Friday nights and comes out on Sunday nights."

###chapter 25

Zoey awkwardly twitched the corner of her mouth.

They'd already found that car, but Charles and Dennis just got a lead?

She forced a smile and returned to her seat.

Alexander told Charles about the discovery he and Zoey made last night.

Charles looked sympathetically at the pitiful Zoey and Alexander. "Officer Davis is really not considerate, You guys are still in your internship period, and he made you stay out all night? What if this workload scares you off?"

Alexander chuckled and replied, "It's nothing. We got used to it back in the police academy."

After he finished speaking, he glanced at Zoey.

He seemed to waiting for her response. However, Zoey didn't even lift her head, focused on the task at hand.

She inserted the copied surveillance footage into her laptop and started playing it.

As the footage played frame by frame, she began calculating in her mind the time it would take from Pleasantville Apartments to the abandoned factory, noting that the distance from the factory to the neighborhood they discovered was approximately 1,640 feet.

For an adult man, 1640 feet would take about five to six minutes to walk.

To prevent any accidents, she adjusted the calculated time by half an hour in the surveillance footage.

Then, Zoey clicked the mouse, and the footage continued to play.

After just a few seconds of playback, Zoey sensed another presence beside her.

Even without turning around, she recognized it was Alexander's scent.

Zoey didn't play the footage too fast, setting it to 1.5x speed.

After about half an hour, she had reviewed all the adjusted time, but the footage still showed no anomalies.

Alexander was already prepared to spend hours or even the whole night studying the surveillance footage.

But the next second, Zoey clicked pause.

Alexander asked in surprise, "Did you find something?"

Zoey stood up and called Robert on her phone. After the call connected, Zoey said, " "Officer Davis, it's me. Can you help me check how many tire tracks are on the ground?"

At this moment, Alexander realized and asked, "You suspect Lawrence had a backup plan at the factory?"

Zoey said, "Just a suspicion. I don't want to spend all my time watching surveillance footage."

Within a minute, Robert called her back. He said, "Two sets of tire tracks! Perfectly preserved."

"Thank you, Officer Davis." Zoey hung up the phone, feeling a bit relieved.

She no longer needed to watch the surveillance footage.

She patiently rewound the footage and divided the work with Alexander.

They started recording all the vehicles entering the neighborhood, and then Alexander contacted the DMV.

Once Zoey finished her tasks, she returned to her dormitory. She had been staying up late for several nights and felt overwhelmed.

When Alexander returned, Zoey was already gone.

He searched around the police station but couldn't find her-he asked Dennis, who was still working on the files, "Dennis, have you seen Zoey?"

Dennis replied, "She seems to have gone to rest."

Alexander thought, 'She went to rest without eating? That's so unlike her.'

The next morning, Zoey woke up early again, feeling just like she did the day before.

Her stomach was growling with hunger.

She looked at her alarm clock in frustration; she had woken up ten minutes earlier than last time.

Zoey bought some snacks from a nearby convenience store and returned to the office.

Alexander saw her holding a piece of bread and greeted her, "Awake?"

Zoey was too hungry to waste any energy talking to him.

She just gave him a cold glance and ignored him.

Alexander had no idea what Zoey meant.

Why was she suddenly giving him the cold shoulder again? Had he offended her somehow in the past few days? He thought for a while but couldn't figure it out.

Zoey returned to her desk and quickly finished the bread. But it didn't seem to satisfy her. She kept stuffing snacks into her mouth.

Alexander was once again shocked by Zoey's appetite, but he really didn't recommend her constantly eating these unhealthy snacks.

Alexander took out the breakfast he had prepared and carefully placed it in front of her.

When he opened the insulated container, it looked delicious and smelled great.

"I made an extra portion for you this morning." This was actually Alexander's own breakfast, but he lied, fearing Zoey wouldn't eat it otherwise.

Zoey looked up. She stared at him for a while before looking away.

Zoey said, "Although I personally find you not very likable, I have to admit you're a good guy."

Alexander was silent. Why couldn't eating shut her up?

"Thanks." Zoey threw away the snacks in her hand and started devouring the breakfast.

Then Zoey finally felt full. As long as she wasn't hungry, she felt very comfortable.

After a busy morning, Zoey accidentally fell asleep on her desk.

Alexander knew she was exhausted lately and didn't wake her.

When Zoey woke up, Alexander had already copied the forms from the DMV and sent her a copy.

"When did they come by?" Zoey actually wanted to ask the DMV some questions about areas she wasn't familiar with.

"They just left," Alexander replied.

Zoey was silent. Why didn't he wake her for something so important?

Seeing Alexander's busy figure and considering the effort he made to bring her a meal, she decided not to hold it against him.

Zoey held the forms and returned to her seat to review them one by one.

After a while, her finger stopped on a familiar name, and she quickly asked, "By the way, can you give me the records we made at Lawrence's store last time?"

Alexander had organized the files very clearly. He accurately pulled out a folder from the desk and handed it to Zoey.

Zoey quickly flipped through it and pulled out the notes. "So it was him."

Alexander leaned over to take a look. "What's up?"

They were so engrossed in what they were reading that they didn't notice their heads were almost touching. Now, they looked like an intimate couple !

Robert asked, "What are you two doing?"

Hearing a voice, they turned their heads in unison.

Robert looked at the file in their hands, curious. How did these two, who used to argue all the time, suddenly become so close?

###chapter 26

Zoey caught a look from Robert and quickly stepped away from Alexander.

"Hey, Officer Davis, did you find anything in the car?" she asked, trying to dodge the awkwardness.

Robert leaned back, taking his time. "You know, this killer's pretty cocky. Probably thought we wouldn't check the car. We found his fingerprints all over and some bloodstains. The tech team's on it, and they'll let us know soon. How's your end going?"

"This car isn't Lawrence's," Alexander said, handing Robert a report with all the suspicious info they'd dug up. "We've been looking into it and found another car acting shady around the same time. It belongs to Lawrence's guy, Brian Scott."

Robert's eyes narrowed as he looked at them. "So, you think there's more than one person involved in these murders?"

Alexander shrugged. "Yeah, but it's just a theory for now."

Robert nodded, glancing at Alexander. "Alright, keep digging. Bring Charles and Dennis back, including Brian, just in case. Once we get those test results and they match, no one's slipping away!" He turned to Zoey. "Zoey, you're with me. We need to check out where the body might've been dumped. Alright, let's get to it!" 

With that, Robert grabbed his bag and headed out with Zoey.

He hit the button on his car key and climbed into an old Santana.

Every time Robert pressed the gas, the car buzzed like crazy. Zoey was about to lose it.

Trying to nap in the back seat, Zoey finally snapped, "Officer Davis, this noise is driving me nuts!"

Robert, used to his old ride, forgot that Zoey, the newbie, wasn't. If it were one of the guys in the back, he'd just say, "Sit or get out!"

But since it was Zoey, he slowed down and gave her an apologetic look in the rearview mirror. "Yeah, this car's old and slow, but it's helped me catch a lot of bad guys. If we can't chase down criminals in this thing anymore, what should we do? But hey, the higher-ups won't give me a new one."

Zoey, staying calm, said, "Easy fix. Just declare it scrapped, and they'll have to give us a new one!"

Robert stared at her for a moment.

"Damn, that's a great idea!" He'd put up with the car for years and never thought of that. "Getting old really does slow me down compared to you young folks!"

Zoey grinned. "Officer Davis, you don't look old at all. You look just over thirty."

Robert chuckled. "Oh, come on, my son's about your age."

Zoey wasn't just being nice. Even though Robert had lost some hair, he still looked pretty young.

As Robert cruised slowly from the Pleasantville Apartments towards the suburban neighborhoods, he and Zoey chatted away.

But then, Zoey suddenly went quiet.

Robert glanced back at her, curious.

She was scribbling something in a notebook.

"What are you up to?" Robert asked.

Without looking up, Zoey said, "There were no cameras at the last intersections. Even though we found the car, if the killer dumped the body, they'd pick a hidden spot. So, I'm narrowing down the possibilities."

Just as she finished, Zoey pointed out the window. "See that fork up ahead? Turning right leads to a residential area. It's on the outskirts, with fewer people, and hardly any surveillance."

"No cameras make it tough," Robert agreed.

They'd have to rely on talking to the locals, but the elderly residents either had trouble hearing or couldn't communicate well, making it a real challenge.

Zoey's sharp eyes scanned the trash bins lining the street. "Or we could check the garbage piles later. With fewer residents, the garbage trucks probably come less often than in the city. We might find something."

Robert parked the car. "Alright, let's get to it!"

They searched everywhere for potential body-dumping sites, but all the routes Zoey had analyzed turned up nothing.

In other words, they found zilch!

Zoey and Robert had been at it all day. Luckily, the cold weather kept their tempers in check, so they weren't too irritable.

Robert, feeling less grumpy with Zoey around, said, "We've been at this all day. Let's grab something to eat."

Zoey, also hungry, nodded. "Sounds good."

They found a food stall in a busy area and ordered two big plates of pasta.

The stall owner greeted them warmly, "Have a seat."

He started making their pasta.

Less than five minutes later, Robert's phone rang. His car was blocking someone's way, and he had to move it.

Seeing Robert's police car, the owner got scared and stopped cooking halfway.

After parking the car, Robert saw the owner quickly packing up.

"Hey, where are you going?" Robert asked.

The owner, looking nervous, said, "Please don't arrest me... I promise I won't set up my stall here again."

Robert sighed. So that's what it was.

He gave Zoey a look, and she quickly stood up to clear things up.

"Sir, we're not here to arrest you. We just want to eat your pasta, that's all," Zoey said.

"Really?" The owner, seeing Zoey's gentle demeanor, slowed his packing.

"Really," Zoey assured him.

The owner finally relaxed and went back to making their pasta.

When he brought the two plates to the table, Robert, worried it might not be enough for Zoey, ordered an extra serving for her.

Zoey dug in and enjoyed her meal immensely.

###chapter 27

The way those two ate was pretty similar-they both scarfed down their food like there was no tomorrow.

Robert had been a detective for so long that he was used to eating on the fly. He finished his big bowl of pasta in no time, way faster than Zoey. Feeling satisfied, he looked at her and asked, "We haven't been able to get a single girl to join our detective department for years. They all think it's too tough. Zoey, how'd you convince your parents to let you become a cop? Didn't they freak out?"

Zoey swallowed her last bite and shrugged. "They don't get a say in it."

"You're something else, really impressive!" Robert said, genuinely impressed.

In his mind, he thought Zoey was different from other girls.

Even though they hadn't known each other long, he could tell Zoey was tough, and that was exactly what their detective department needed.

Zoey thought back to her time at the police academy and nodded. "Yeah, I think so!"

Robert laughed and gave her a thumbs up. "I really appreciate young people like you!"

Zoey smiled politely.

By the time they finished eating, it was already dark. After they rechecked the suspicious area and still found nothing, it was almost 11 PM.

Robert told Zoey to get back in the car; the night wind was freezing, and even he was shivering. He was worried Zoey wouldn't be able to handle it.

Sitting by the car window, Robert kept thinking out loud, 'It's really strange; where could those bodies have been dumped? There are just residential areas. Could he have rented a house just to store the bodies?'

Zoey didn't think the killer would be dumb enough to rent a house just to store bodies.

She looked at the planned routes in her hand, crossing off one after another.

She had checked almost all the small roads on the map, and her fieldwork over the past two days confirmed the accuracy of her routes.

She and Alexander had already reviewed the surveillance in the area, and she remembered everything useful.

The person in the suspicious car didn't stop or open its doors to dump anything in the surveillance area of this road. The car always entered the residential area around 8:30 PM and left around 9:30 PM.

This area was almost suburban, with very few young residents, and there were usually no cars at night.

If the car was driving on the street, it wouldn't hit any traffic lights, which meant there was only one possibility: the killer was driving at a constant speed, which was why he was always so punctual.

But if he needed to stop to use the bathroom and found a secluded spot to dump the body, the timing would definitely be different.

Zoey's eyes lit up; she had found a way!

She immediately called Alexander.

Alexander was reviewing notes when his phone rang. Seeing it was an unknown number, he still answered.

Before he could say anything, Zoey urgently said, "Listen up, follow the order I gave you and start with Sunshine Mart. I need you to calculate the time the car takes to travel between these two surveillance points right now. If you're swamped, just send me a segment first."

Before he could ask anything, the call abruptly ended.

Alexander was speechless; he didn't get a chance to ask a single question.

Feeling helpless, Alexander started retrieving the surveillance footage as she requested.

Meanwhile, Zoey hung up the phone and called out to Robert, who was smoking, "Officer Davis, let's head back to the supermarket at the entrance of this street, Sunshine Mart. Then we'll drive at a moderate speed to the last surveillance point."

Robert guessed Zoey had discovered something and quickly put out his cigarette. "What did you find?"

Zoey flipped to a new page in her notebook and started drawing a new route.

"Officer Davis, I'm just speculating right now, not entirely sure," Zoey said.

But Robert had an inexplicable trust in her. Even if it was just a guess, he was willing to accompany her on another round in the cold night.

Robert waved his hand and said, "Let's go, get in the car!"

Zoey settled into the passenger seat. As the car started moving, she continuously gazed out the window, comparing the passing scenery with the route she had drawn and making constant adjustments.

Starting from Sunshine Mart, the car drove almost at a steady speed of 21.7 mph to the abandoned factory. It gradually slowed down until it came to a stop at the last monitored location.

Zoey looked at the stopwatch, noting it took just over twenty minutes.

Based on their speed and time, the distance between Sunshine Mart and the second surveillance point was about 3.7 miles, and the suspicious vehicle took 9 minutes to cover this distance, meaning its speed should have been 24.8 mph.

The distance between the first and last two surveillance points was about 19.8 miles. Dividing by the constant speed, the car would have been driving for 48 minutes, only three minutes off from their previous surveillance calculations.

This meant that if her guess was correct, the suspicious car must have exceeded 24.8 mph at some point to make up for the time spent dumping the body.

At this thought, Zoey's phone vibrated. She saw a friend request from "Alexander."

Alexander's Facebook nickname was his own name. Although the profile picture wasn't of him, it was clearly his style.

His profile picture was a pure expanse of white.

Zoey knew he added her for work-related reasons and quickly accepted.

Alexander sent her all the files she needed, along with a message.

Alexander: [How's the investigation going on your end? When do you think you'll be back at the station?]

Zoey: [Not sure.]

Alexander was silent.

He had helped her, but she still was indifferent. Knowing Zoey's consistent attitude towards him, he was used to it.

At least she replied.

Zoey opened the file he sent, noticing a prominent red mark, with extra ink to make sure she saw it.

She quickly realized that Alexander must have noticed something wrong too.

###chapter 28

From Sun Street No. 11 to Sun Street No. 108, she flipped through the pages in no time.

Alexander had thrown in a bunch of notes to make things clearer for her, showing he really put in the work.

Zoey wasn't planning to go through each street one by one but decided to start with this road first.

In under five minutes, the result came back at a whopping 34 mph.

Zoey pulled out her hand-drawn map and compared it with Google Maps.

According to Google Maps, there were no tall buildings at the end of Sun Street! Instead, there were unplanted farmlands taking up two-thirds of the area.

When they got there, the farmland was completely deserted.

The only clue? Just two abandoned, rundown mud houses, covering about 500-600 square feet. Judging by the dust outside, they'd been left alone for ages.

Especially at night, this place looked straight out of a horror movie. Tree shadows were scattered all over the ground, and you could occasionally hear owls hooting, sounding like a kid.

"Officer Davis, we're back again," Zoey said, feeling a bit emotional.

They had passed by several times without searching because it was too remote.

They finally saw those two mud houses! "Let's go!" Robert took the first step into the dirt.

Zoey followed right behind him.

The soil was soft and overgrown with dead grass, making it tough to walk through.

After struggling through the land, they finally reached the small mud house. They exchanged a glance, thrilled to be getting close to the truth!

"Here, take this." Robert, being a seasoned officer, had plenty of emergency gear. He pulled out a flashlight and handed it to Zoey.

Zoey had planned to use her phone's flashlight, but seeing this, she silently turned off her phone.

The flashlight was way brighter than her phone's light, lighting up a larger area.

Robert shone the flashlight through the broken door and windows, trying to see if anyone was inside. But the windows were filthy, covered with dirt from wind and rain, making it impossible to see through.

The surroundings were completely barren, with not even a single streetlight in sight. For convenience, Robert asked Zoey to wait where she was. He then trudged back through the tough terrain to the car, turned on the headlights, and aimed them at the old house they needed to enter. The car headlights weren't super bright, probably because of the distance. But at least there was some light.

Robert quickly returned to the front of the old house and reunited with Zoey.

"Zoey, let me see if this door can still hold. Step back a bit," Robert said, wearing disposable gloves and gripping the door handle.

Zoey covered her nose and took a few steps back.

With a gentle push, the rickety door made a sharp noise in the quiet night.

Then the door opened.

The old house wasn't big, and you could almost see everything inside at a glance.

The two of them searched around but came up empty-handed.

"Damn it, there's nothing here either!" Officer Davis muttered, pinching his nose as he walked out of the room.

The old house had been abandoned for so long that even breathing inside felt like a workout for the lungs.

Zoey let out a heavy sigh, her brows furrowing.

She couldn't figure out where the problem was. If it wasn't here, where did Lawrence dump the body?

While she was lost in thought, Robert was bending over, trying to clear the weeds beside the house. When he couldn't pull them out, he kicked them directly and said, "Usually, old houses that haven't been demolished are used for storing random stuff. I need to check if there's a cellar!"

Zoey bent over to help, but Robert stopped her.

"I got this. It's dirty here, no need for you to get involved." After a while of cleaning, Robert didn't find any sign of a cellar.

"No cellar and no smell of a corpse either," he said, clearly frustrated.

Robert took off his disposable gloves, yawned, and glanced at the time. "It's already 11:30." He hadn't realized it had gotten so late. He turned and asked, "Where are you staying? I'll take you back first."

Zoey said, "I stay at the female staff dormitory at the precinct."

"You've been staying there all this time?" Robert was momentarily surprised. The dormitory was notorious for being hard to sleep in.

Since it was a dormitory, no matter what time the casework was completed, there was always the possibility that someone might unexpectedly open the dormitory door. People staying there couldn't sleep well at all.

Zoey was also a bit surprised to see Robert so shocked. She said, "What's wrong, Officer Davis?"

"How can you rest well with the conditions in the dormitory?" Robert looked at Zoey, who was about the same age as his son, with some pity. He said, "Come on, my son is away at college, and his room is empty. You can sleep there."

Zoey felt helpless. Robert didn't even ask if she agreed or not.

"I..." She hadn't even had a chance to refuse.

Robert enthusiastically introduced, "Don't worry, my house is about the same distance from the precinct as the dormitory. You can sleep in, and you won't be disturbed. Plus, my wife is a great cook."

He mentioned his wife with a happy smile on his face.

The flashlight in Zoey's hand precariously slipped and tumbled to the floor. In that very moment, its light cast upon the ground, astonishingly revealing two distinct patches of differing materials.

Robert was standing on a manhole cover. She shone the flashlight closer and saw that it was very clean, contrasting sharply with the surrounding dust.

"Hold on, I know you're a foodie. I'll call my wife now and ask her to prepare some good food for us!" Robert took out his phone to dial, then turned to ask, "Zoey, what do you want to eat?"

Zoey didn't respond to Robert's question. She took a big step forward and stood beside him.

Then she gently tapped his arm and said, "Officer Davis, it looks like we won't be having that midnight snack."

###chapter 29

Robert's hand holding the phone paused slightly. "What's wrong?"

Then he followed Zoey's gaze, looking at the spot he had just stepped before.

Zoey kept shining her flashlight on it.

He also shone his light a couple of times but didn't see anything unusual.

Robert asked, "What did you find?"

Zoey examined it seriously for a few seconds before slowly looking up to explain, "Officer Davis, don't you think this manhole cover is strange?"

 "What's so strange about it?" Robert asked. He thought Zoey was just eager to solve the case since she had just joined the detective team, so she found everything suspicious.

He smiled. It was people like her who could join the detective department; because they needed to have sharp eyes. But everything shouldn't be made a big deal out of; making a big deal out of small things could bring a lot of burden to themselves and the team. 

"The manhole cover itself isn't strange, what's strange is that it's the manhole cover here." Even though it was midnight, Zoey still looked around seriously and continued to explain to Robert, "The harvest season here has long passed, and judging by the dust on the houses, almost no one lives here. But this manhole cover is brand new. If it had been left unattended for a long time, the gap between the cover and the frame would be filled with dust and mud from rainy days, making it hard to open."

Zoey continued, "If it wasn't a professional, they probably couldn't open it. And professionals would clean the gap to open the manhole cover. And I think there's something wrong with this manhole cover because its gap is cleaner than those on the main streets."

After Zoey's analysis, Robert understood what she meant.

Robert said, "Your analysis makes sense. If someone is skilled, it wouldn't take more than a few minutes to open this manhole cover."

Zoey glanced back at their car, "Do we have any tools?"

Seeing Zoey's anxious look, Robert couldn't help but laugh.

Zoey was smart, talented, and meticulous.; she even worked harder than he did.

Robert said, "Wait here, I'll call the station!"

It was pointless for Zoey to be anxious. Without professional tools, they could only wait.

Robert made a call to the detective department and said, "Why are you messing with Alexander's phone? Give it to him."

As Alexander answered the phone, Robert said, "It's me. Don't ask so many questions, just listen! Call everyone who's not busy in the detective department and get them over here! I'll send you the location in a bit; hurry up, as it's freezing out here. Additionally, bring an assortment of tools to open the manhole cover."

"Don't hang up yet! When you drive over, remember to bring us some food from the city."  Robert mentioned the late-night snack and specifically looked at Zoey beside him, then added, "Bring as much as you can."

Zoey had been working hard with them and they couldn't let her go hungry.

She had only been in the detective department for a few days but had been staying up late every day. For that alone, they had to make sure she was well-fed.

Alexander instantly understood who Robert meant by "bring as much as you can."

Alexander smiled, saying, "Got it!"

After hanging up, Robert laughed again. "You young people, I don't know if it's because you just became detectives and find it exciting, enjoying the process of solving cases. How can you be so happy working at bedtime?"

Zoey knew exactly who he was talking about. Who else but Alexander?

Alexander had been competing with her since school; he was a freak to her.

If it weren't for the scholarship competition, she wouldn't have wasted so much time staying up late to beat him.

Thinking about this, Zoey's remaining goodwill towards Alexander vanished.

The suburbs at night were much colder than the city because the city had tall buildings that could reduce the wind resistance by half. But the suburbs were full of dense woods.

After standing outside for a few minutes, Zoey and Robert felt chilled to the bone.

Robert observed the manhole cover with his flashlight for a while, then turned to see Zoey rubbing her arms to keep warm.

He got up and walked back to the car, rummaging through the trunk for a few minutes before returning to Zoey's side.

He handed her some foam padding. "Lay this down; it'll keep you warmer."

While Robert directly just sat on the ground.

Robert extracted a cigarette from his pocket, intending to light it to stave off drowsiness, and struck up a conversation with Zoey, "Where do you hail from?"

Zoey said, "Next to Emerald City, Shadow City."

"That's pretty close, just a two-hour train ride." Robert spoke with the cigarette in his mouth. From his posture, it was clear he was a seasoned smoker.

Zoey nodded. "Yes."

"An only child?" Robert asked, immediately feeling that he had disgraced his position as chief inspector of the detective department with such a banal question.

If Zoey was an only child, would her parents let her go to the police academy?

Zoey's eyes darkened with the night. "I have a younger sister."

Robert asked, "How much younger?"

Zoey's tone unknowingly became heavy, but Robert didn't notice, thinking she was just tired.

Zoey said, "Three years."

"That's nice. So, you just graduated from college, and she's in university now? What major did she choose? It's not the police academy as well?" 

Zoey said, "She died."

Robert's eyes momentarily darkened, and the act of holding the cigarette in his mouth came to an abrupt halt.

"Zoey, I didn't mean to ask those questions... I just wanted to get to know you better. After all, we'll be working together a lot in the future." Robert tried to explain, then Zoey force a stiff smile and shake her head. "It's okay; I was just joking."

Robert was shocked.

Putting aside Robert's years as a seasoned detective, he was also a middle-aged man with a family! From the first time he met Zoey, he felt she was different from others.

She didn't smile much, didn't open up to others, and seemed hard to approach. Only when working on a case did she show her serious side.

Robert genuinely believed that Zoey must have had a difficult upbringing, with parents who neglected her, leading to her current personality.

Robert didn't dare to chat with her anymore, afraid he might make her cry.

He didn't even know what to do when his own wife cried. If Zoey cried, he thought it would be harder to handle than the case.

###chapter 30

As Robert finally stopped talking to her, Zoey felt the world had finally quieted down.

She closed her eyes, enjoying the moment.

As a slightly cool breeze brushed across her face, she felt refreshed and relaxed.

Her ears could hear not only the wind but also the rustling of leaves and the chirping of insects and birds. Though not as lively as in summer, it had its own charm. Nature had an inexplicable way of banishing the gloom within one's heart.

Unconsciously, she was so comfortable that she almost fell asleep.

Two glaring beams of light came irregularly towards her, and she instinctively covered her eyes with her hand.

In just a few seconds, the sound of footsteps grew closer and then stopped beside her.

"Officer Davis!" It was Alexander's voice.

Those two glaring lights disappeared at that moment.

Zoey squinted her eyes, readjusted to the environment, and looked up.

Alexander was holding two bags, and even though the food containers inside were not yet opened, the aroma of the food was already wafting through the air.

Zoey thought that it smelled so good!

"Officer Davis, Zoey, I've brought you some delicious food - it's the largest portion of pasta!" Alexander said.

Then he handed the two bags to them, one for each.

"It's hot, hurry up and eat."

Zoey took it eagerly and opened the food container.

She immediately buried her head and started eating.

At this time, Dennis and Charles got off the car carrying a toolbox and gestured to Zoey to move aside a bit.

They opened the toolbox and began selecting tools. They took out two long, black iron rods, one for each of them.

"Officer Davis, where's the manhole cover?" Dennis asked.

Robert, with his mouth full, pointed to his feet while chewing. "Right here."

Dennis glanced in the direction he pointed. It was right under Robert's feet!

He nudged Charles beside him. "Move aside!" Then he took a flashlight and handed the flashlight to Charles. "Hold this for me."

Charles nodded. "OK."

Charles held the flashlight and adjusted the light to be brighter.

Compared to the surrounding darkness, this area looked like daytime.

Dennis examined the manhole cover again, then took a step back, found a suitable spot, and firmly wedged the iron rod into the hole of the manhole cover. He tested it first, then used all his strength.

Charles beside Dennis felt it was really a tough job and couldn't help but admire Dennis, "Dennis, you're amazing!"

Dennis said, "Alright, this is not the time for flattery!"

Charles fell silent. He was just trying to give Dennis some encouragement.

Then, with a roar from Dennis, the manhole cover was lifted!

As the manhole cover was lifted, an indescribable stench instantly filled their noses! Even covering their noses, they could still smell it, because it was too foul.

"Damn it." Dennis immediately threw the iron rod, pinched his nose, and kept retreating.

Zoey nearly regurgitated the pasta she had just eaten.

Adhering to the principle of not wasting food, she quickly covered the food container with its lid to prevent the smell from contaminating her delicious food.

Compared to the others, only Alexander remained relatively calm.

Alexander remarked, "Such a strong smell of methane."

"It's not just methane." Robert replied with a hint of excitement, snatching the headlamp from Charles's head and said softly, "There's also the smell of a corpse."

"The smell of a corpse?" Although everyone disliked the smell, they all got excited upon hearing that.

They took a few steps forward, trying to shine their flashlights inside. But they couldn't see anything.

They were about to ask Robert what to do next. As they turned around, they saw that Robert had already prepared himself. He was wearing high waterproof boots and waterproof gloves, lying beside the manhole cover, shining a flashlight inside, and estimating the height before climbing in.

Half of his body had just entered when he shouted to the others, "Get down here!"

Zoey was the first to rush out, wanting to follow him down.

But Robert stopped her and said, "You stay up here and watch. We'll handle this dirty work!"

Zoey was more than happy.

One by one, the others climbed into the manhole, and soon, only Zoey was left on the ground.

She could occasionally hear echoes from below, but couldn't make out the specific content. Because she didn't follow them down, she had no idea what was happening inside. She could only sit and wait.

After several minutes, there was finally a sound emanating from the manhole cover.

Alexander asked, "Zoey, where's the evidence box?"

Zoey looked at Alexander, whose face was covered in black grime, contrasting with his usually clean appearance, and smiled. "Just put it here; I'll get the dust bags."

Alexander used some strength, and threw up a black garbage bag. Then he went back inside.

Zoey fetched the professional toolbox, skillfully put on gloves and a mask, and got herself equipped.

Then she took out a UV flashlight from the toolbox and scanned the entire black garbage bag, finding no fingerprints or anything, and then used a wet wipe to clean the bag.

While cleaning, she could clearly feel something hard inside the black garbage bag.

The stench emanating from it was so strong that even wearing a mask couldn't block it.

She opened the black plastic bag and looked inside, which was a nearly decomposed head.

The facial features were still vaguely visible, but not very recognizable. The face's moisture had likely evaporated from being left there for too long. The only notable thing was that the head had no hair at all.

Upon closer inspection, Zoey made another shocking discovery. Not only was there no hair, but the scalp was also missing!

Judging by the level of decomposition and considering the body was thrown into such a damp and cold place like the sewer, she roughly estimated it had been there for at least half a month.

If it had been half a month, it would coincide with the time when Ella was targeted by Lawrence.

Considering the three missing persons, if she guessed correctly, this head should belong to Aria!

###chapter 31

She rummaged through the bag again and found some pieces of meat under the head, which felt a bit heavy in her hand.

She shone a flashlight on it; the concentration of the blood wasn't very deep. It seemed that some dirty water had accidentally gotten into the bag, causing the blood to change color.

But she wasn't a forensic expert and couldn't tell which parts of the victim's body these pieces of meat came from. She carefully and meticulously placed them in dust-free bags and put them in the evidence box.

They were searching below; while she was handling the evidence above.

They were so engrossed in their work that they didn't realize it was already 4 a.m.

Robert finally brought them up from below, and the first thing they did was take off their stinky gear.

"The only usable part now is this head. The rest of the bodies are all skeletons. Even the fingerprints and DNA that could be used have disappeared with the decomposition of the bodies. Damn it!" Charles cursed in frustration.

Zoey carefully examined the other black plastic bags they had brought up with a UV flashlight.

Unexpectedly, she found a few blurred fingerprints at the seal of one of the black plastic bags.

"See that?" she said smugly, raising an eyebrow at Charles.

Charles, along with Alexander and the others, had their fatigue replaced by excitement in their eyes. "Looks like Lawrence won't get away this time! Let's see what he has to say now!"

Dennis stretched his arms and legs. Besides Robert, he was the oldest in the team, and his stamina wasn't as good as the younger ones. He had fought all night and was sore all over. He said, "Lawrence probably didn't expect us to trace it here! But he really racked his brains, because he actually brought the bodies to this place! No one would come to a sewer like this; he's really something else."

Charles said, "He did something bad; of course, he had to think about how not to get caught."

"Yeah, every criminal is cunning. None of them will confess without solid evidence," Dennis glanced at Robert, "Officer Davis, how many more sewers are there in this area? Are we still searching?"

"We've found the stuff, why worry about Lawrence not confessing? If we keep searching like this, it'll never end. Let's go back to the station. These pieces of evidence are enough to make Lawrence tell the truth!" Robert led the men to load the heavy toolboxes and evidence boxes back into the car.

As Zoey couldn't drive, she naturally sat in the back, yawned, and fell asleep.

She even didn't know what time they got back to the station.

Zoey was woken up by someone knocking on the car window. "Zoey, wake up, there's a meeting."

Zoey responded, gave a big yawn, and groggily got up from the back seat.

She looked at the sky but couldn't tell if it was morning or noon.

She followed Charles, who had called her, into the station.

Robert and the others were all lazily sitting in their seats; everyone looking tired.

Robert had printed several copies of the documents sent over by the forensic and technical departments and just threw them on the table.

They each took a copy and started flipping through it.

Robert said, "According to the forensic results, two fingerprints were found on that car, one belonging to Lawrence and the other to Brian."

"What about the bloodstains?" Zoey asked.

Robert said, "They matched Aria and Lily. Now we just need to wait for the autopsy report, then this will be closed!"

Robert looked at everyone with a satisfied smile.

All the effort over this period hadn't been in vain and they felt very content. Everyone had been running around to give the victims' families an answer as soon as possible.

"Great, my eyes were about to go blind from watching the surveillance footage, but it was worth it!" Charles said, tired but a bit happy.

Once this case was closed, they could take a few days off!

Robert said, "Alright, let's rest for now. I'll notify you when there's news!"

"Got it, Officer Davis!"

Following Robert's instructions, they each went to the rest area to catch up on sleep.

By around 6 p.m, the autopsy report came out.

At this time, everyone all woke up and returned to the station.

The forensic expert had pieced together three incomplete female bodies. Besides the marks found on the neck bones and the unnatural fractures of the hyoid and thyroid cartilage, most of the bones had no other marks except for the cut marks where they were severed. So the forensic expert preliminarily determined that the three victims died of mechanical asphyxia; based on the marks, they believed the victims were strangled with a rope.

Only Aria's remaining soft tissue showed severe damage to the vocal cords, covered with marks, suspected to be caused by a blade.

As for the fractures, the killer used common dismemberment methods, disarticulating at the joints. The bone damage was severe, with characteristics of heavy chopping, cleanly severed in one blow. It was preliminarily determined to be done with an axe-like tool. However, this didn't match the characteristics of the shattered kneecaps, so the forensic expert believed the victim's kneecaps were broken before death.

Zoey saw these reports and unconsciously clenched her fists.

What kind of cruel treatment did those victims endure? Even if she had guessed, she couldn't face these bloody pieces of evidence.

Lawrence had imprisoned them and then dismembered them.

She could even see how desperate the victims were in their final moments as they begged Lawrence not to kill them.

Alexander sat across from Zoey and could capture her emotions immediately.

He comforted her, "They will be punished! The law never favors the wicked!"

Zoey looked at him for a second, then returned her gaze to the report in her hand.

Two valid fingerprints were detected on garbage bag No. 1, both belonging to Lawrence.

Four valid fingerprints were detected on garbage bag No. 2, all belonging to Lawrence.

Brian was the one who disposed of the bodies, but the fingerprints detected were Lawrence's.

"No way," Dennis said after reading the report, feeling a headache. "Lawrence is definitely involved, but we only have that car as evidence against Brian. But that car has long been scrapped, how do we prove the owner is Brian?"

"But we found his fingerprints," Charles said.

"What good are fingerprints? He can just say he lent the car to Lawrence, and the bloodstains found in the car were well hidden, so he can claim he didn't know."

"Damn it!" Charles felt that the case wouldn't be solved anytime soon after Dennis's analysis.

###chapter 32

The excitement in their eyes disappeared instantly, then the atmosphere became heavy.

Robert observed the palpable dejection within the group and was rendered speechless. He remarked, "Are you all foolish? If Lawrence has already confessed, do you really believe Brian can escape?"

Dennis said, "Officer Davis, have you forgotten those criminals who, knowing they face the death penalty, take all the blame upon themselves?"

Robert was on the brink of losing his mind over Dennis's hypothesis. He glared at Dennis fiercely and retorted, "That kind of scenario applies to spouses, or to a mother and child! Brian and Lawrence are merely superior and subordinate-do you think their bond is that strong? Enough, stop talking. I'm hungry now. Let's go eat! Once we've had our fill, we'll go and confront Lawrence."

Dennis fell silent, wondering why Robert was unhappy with his opinion.

The group went to the cafeteria and sat down to eat.

Everyone seemed preoccupied, undoubtedly thinking about what to do if there was no evidence against Brian.

Since Zoey was the only one eating heartily, everyone couldn't help but be impressed by Zoey's appetite.

"Zoey, how do you have such a great appetite?" Charles couldn't help but be a bit envious. "How do you manage to eat so much and not gain weight?"

"I don't know." Zoey answered in between bites.

Everyone exchanged glances and then returned to their meals.

After eating, Robert led the group, planning to interrogate Lawrence!

Since Brian was also a suspect, he was summoned to the interrogation room as well.

So when everyone saw Brian and Lawrence each in a separate interrogation room, they all looked at Robert.

Dennis asked, "Officer Davis, who should we interrogate first?"

Alexander said, "Do we even need to ask Officer Davis? It has to be Brian! At least two bodies are connected to Lawrence, and we already have evidence of his crimes, so we don't fear him not talking. We need to get other testimonies from Brian!"

"How can you be so sure?" Charles looked at Alexander in confusion.

Alexander replied, "Because when we went to question Brian, we found his temperament too volatile. We can definitely use that."

Robert thought Alexander's suggestion was good. "Alright, let's do as you say."

Zoey, however, disagreed, "What's the point of interrogating him? When we went to question him, didn't you understand what kind of person Brian is? He won't admit anything. As long as Lawrence confesses, even if Brian doesn't admit it, it won't change the facts! This way, we can save time."

Robert nodded. "Zoey has a point too."

Alexander looked up at Zoey. "No, what I mean is, we can get more clues from Brian."

Zoey said, "Don't we have enough clues? Lawrence isn't stupid enough to take the blame for multiple murders. What kind of relationship do they have? Why would he take the death penalty for Brian?"

Alexander didn't understand why Zoey was so angry. Then He didn't say anything more.

Zoey said, "Brian is undoubtedly the mastermind behind this serial murder case. Dealing with such a ruthless person without evidence is a waste of time. We should get Lawrence to talk and observe his reaction."

At least, as long as Lawrence mentioned Brian, they would have a reason to keep Brian in custody as a suspect!

Alexander asked, "What if Lawrence denies it?"

Zoey said, "Then we can trick him, saying Brian has already confessed!"

"Trick him?" Alexander was confused about her words. "We are police officers; why should we trick suspects? This would damage the police's authority!"

Zoey asked, "You're talking about authority with a scumbag who killed multiple people?"

Alexander said righteously, "Tricking suspects can affect future interrogations. What would people think of us police officers if word gets out?"

Zoey frowned slightly, looking at Alexander. "Psychological warfare may not work on all suspects, but it's always worth a try."

The onlookers were stunned.

Alexander and Zoey were at each other's throats, arguing over which suspect to interrogate first. It felt like if no one intervened, they would start fighting.

Robert took a deep breath and quickly stood up to mediate, "Alright, you both have valid points. You are both valuable talents in our police force. I know you're serious. So, Alexander, you and Dennis go interrogate Brian. Charles and Zoey, you go interrogate Lawrence. I'll be outside watching, okay?"

Seeing Robert trying to mediate, Alexander quickly calmed down and apologized to everyone, "I got a bit worked up earlier, sorry. I'll follow Officer Davis's instructions."

Zoey also agreed.

Alexander and Dennis then headed to the interrogation room with Brian.

Brian had been waiting for a long time and was already a bit impatient. Seeing Alexander's familiar face, he sneered. "It's you again!" 

Brian glanced at Dennis, who had entered with Alexander, and upon realizing it wasn't Zoey, whom he loathed, he scoffed. "Where's that woman who was with you? Is she too afraid to face me?"

Alexander's eyes suddenly turned sharp. "Mr. Scott, insulting an officer is a serious offense, and I remind you that this is a police station!"

The criminal investigation department had no other women, only Zoey, who was transferred from another precinct.

Realizing he was talking about Zoey, Alexander was about to reprimand him when Brian, full of disdain, said, "Oh, so scary! I almost forgot; thanks for the reminder, officer."

He then sneered at the two of them. "Just make sure that bitch doesn't handle my case. She hates me, and if she falsely accuses me, what am I supposed to do? I'm just an ordinary person."

Dennis really couldn't stand him slandering Zoey after committing crimes!

He slammed the table in anger and shouted at Brian, "Watch your mouth! Speak when you're asked to!You you actually dare to openly provoke the police in the station; I can detain you right now! We have plenty of reasons to deal with someone like you!"

Sure enough, after Dennis's outburst, Brian immediately quieted down.

Seeing Brian calm down, Alexander began the interrogation. He took a photo from the file on the table and pushed it in front of Brian. "Do you recognize this car?"

###chapter 33

It was indeed Brian's car that was found.

Brian glanced at the car in the photo and sneered, "I've been following Lawrence for several years now. The salary isn't that high, but I make about $70,000 to $80,000 a year. Can't you find out what my living standards are?This junk car doesn't even catch my eye." 

Dennis slammed the table angrily. "Answer the questions honestly! Fix your attitude! How many times have I told you? If you don't cooperate, we'll charge you with obstructing a police investigation! Do you really think we can't deal with you?"

Every time Dennis spoke, Brian's arrogance would subside for a while.

Seeing Brian's cowardly behavior, Alexander couldn't help but laugh, saying, "Mr. Scott, I didn't expect your aggressive personality to be an act?" If he were truly aggressive, he wouldn't only be aggressive towards seemingly gentle people and women, but be honest in front of Dennis?

Alexander said, "Your acting is a bit poor. Of course, we didn't bring you here to criticize your acting. We surely have some evidence, otherwise, we wouldn't be asking you to come forward and confess."

Brian refused to admit it, but the light in his eyes was dimming. He asked, "What do you mean? Are you going to torture me for a confession?"

"No, Mr. Scott, how could we possibly torture you? You said you didn't recognize this car, but we are confused. You said you've never seen it, but we found your fingerprints in the car." Alexander perfectly demonstrated what it meant to smile with hidden intentions.

Seeing Brian's face fall upon hearing this, Alexander remained resolute, still smiling, "So, how do you plan to cooperate with us? Will you persist in your shoddy pretense, or will you earnestly address our questions?"

Cold sweat was already forming on Brian's forehead.

To cover his nervousness, Brian coughed lightly into his fist and pretended not to care. "Isn't it normal not to recognize this car? I can't be expected to remember every single one I've ridden in, can I?"

He then pretended to study the photo for a long time before suddenly realizing, "I remember now, this license plate looks like my boss Lawrence's car. I drove it once to make a delivery. His license plate is easy to remember, so I have some impression of it."

Alexander watched his awkward acting, knowing he wouldn't admit it.

Alexander had to play along, "May I ask, what kind of delivery requires you to drive his car? It wouldn't be a body, would it?"

Brian's cold sweat had already reached his chin, and soon his shirt was damp with sweat.

Brian said, "Don't accuse me falsely! A delivery is just a delivery; the supermarket even has records!"

Alexander asked, "Okay, then tell us, what kind of delivery requires you to go to Lawrence's place every Friday night and leave his house every weekend night?"

Brian was silent.

Alexander asked again, "Every Monday, you drive your own car to work at the supermarket. This car has never been returned to its owner?"

Brian nodded. "Yes."

Alexander said, "You indeed have a good relationship with the owner.He bought a car and doesn't drive it, letting you drive it all the time." 

"So what?" Brian was getting anxious, trying to divert the topic.

Alexander remained calm. "I suspect that you were lying earlier. I have reason to suspect the car's owner is your relative."

Brian was speechless. 

"You!" Brian pointed at Alexander, but the next second, Dennis's gaze scared him off.

Alexander continued to press, "You haven't explained my question yet. Are you planning to think of a reason to fool us?"

Seeing how persistent Alexander was, Brian thought for a moment and quickly put on a fearless attitude, saying, "Fine, since you're asking why I drive his car at that specific time, I'll tell you. It's because my boss insisted I try out his car. He's the boss, no matter how broken the car is, I have to drive it! I can't drive it during work, so I can only drive it during my days off. Is it a crime for friends to drive each other's cars, sir?"

Alexander asked, "So you admit it? You were the one driving this car for those three days?"

Brian said, "Yes, it was me."

Alexander looked through the notes in his hand and frowned slightly. "I'm really curious. What do you two men do together for two days every week? And this has been going on for nine months. Do you have some issues with your sexual orientation?"

Brian didn't even think before responding, "It's all because I'm too kind. Lawrence always told me he had no friends growing up. I feel pity for him, so I thought I'd keep him company on weekends. I hoped to change his introverted personality. After all, he's the supermarket owner. If his business grows, he can't always avoid talking to people, right?"

"Well, I didn't expect this." Brian looked very helpless and angry. "I don't know what Lawrence did and now I have to be brought to the police station. Damn it, I'm never being a good person again!"

Alexander and Dennis watched Brian's self-directed performance and exchanged a smile. Clearly, no one believed him.

"If Lawrence heard what you said, he would be moved by your kindness." Alexander chuckled, "But back to the point, did you know this car has fake plates?"

"Fake plates? I didn't know that. I've driven it on the streets so many times, and no traffic cops caught me. What's going on? Did Lawrence really do something? How is it a fake plate car?"

Alexander watched him act quietly and gently summarized, "From what you said, you took Lawrence's fake plate car at his strong request. To warm his heart and make him a normal person, you would go to his house every Friday after work to bond with him. Moreover, this car is being used by you, but you have no idea what Lawrence typically does. Is that right?"

Brian said, "Damn, your understanding is spot on; that's exactly it!"

###chapter 34

Alexander noticed Brian's agreement with his words, and the smile on his face deepened slightly. 

Alexander said, "It seems like your relationship has been quite strong lately, even to the point of life and death. He can make you willingly help him dispose of a body."

Brian was stunned. "What?"

Brian looked bewildered. "He killed someone? No, what does his killing someone have to do with me? With his reclusive personality, it's a character flaw that he could commit murder, but not me! I'm a normal person; don't accuse me!"

After responding to Alexander, he muttered under his breath, "Oh my God, I've been with a murderer for so long, so terrifying. Damn, I'm glad I'm okay."

Alexander ignored his poor acting and continued to ask, "How can it have nothing to do with you? Don't you spend every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday together? How could you not have noticed anything?"

Brian realized that Alexander's questions were pressing him step by step.

He pretended to think for a moment, then he said, "I really didn't notice anything... Every time, he would clean the house spotless over the weekend. He told me he had OCD and couldn't stand any dirt. He also had a bit of a compulsive disorder. If there was anything strange..." He thought for a moment and then answered Alexander, "It would be his guest bedroom."

He continued, "Whenever we stayed up late playing games, he wouldn't allow me to sleep in the guest bedroom, insisting that I sleep on the couch instead."

"Guest bedroom." Alexander remembered what Zoey had said and looked sharply at Brian, continuing to ask, "Didn't you ever look in the guest bedroom out of curiosity, or did you hear any sounds coming from it?"

Brian replied, "Officer, since you've investigated this far, you should know that those old houses have poor soundproofing, right? There were no sounds from the guest bedroom, but I often heard the neighbors next door making noise in bed, which was really annoying. It disturbed me so much I wanted to yell at them. They don't care about anyone else's feelings at all!"

Alexander could tell that his last two sentences were genuine, as his expression was too real.

He recorded everything Brian said and continued to ask, "Tell me, what do you and Lawrence do when you spend several days together?"

Brian said, "What else can we do? We usually indulge in games, eat when hunger strikes, and sleep when fatigue sets in!"

Alexander asked a few irrelevant questions to make Brian relax a bit.

He responded and immediately brought the topic back to the fake license plate car, "You said you've been using this car, so explain why the victim's blood was found in it."

"Blood?" Brian shook his head frantically. "I don't know about that. I always drive the car alone, and there's no one else in it. Aren't there surveillance cameras along the way? Can't you check them?"

As he spoke, his eyes kept darting between the two officers.

Brian noticed that Alexander's gaze was fixed on him and continued, "Maybe Lawrence deliberately put it in the car to frame me. With his reclusive personality, it's not hard to understand why he would do something like that, right?"

Then Brian cursed, "Damn it, no wonder he kept asking me to go to his house, so he wanted me to take the fall for him!"

Alexander sneered, "Alright, don't be so quick to say that. Our police won't wrongfully accuse anyone, but we also won't let any guilty person go. You say you don't know anything, but you should know this."

He pulled out a photo and handed it to Brian.

Brian looked at the black plastic bag in the photo.

Alexander asked, "Does this black plastic bag look familiar? Explain why your fingerprints were found on it, and not just one. Do you need me to remind you what was inside?"

"It was the victim's dismembered body parts." Alexander saw Brian shudder uncontrollably and continued, "There was also the victim's head. Do you need me to describe it in detail?"

"Impossible!" Brian almost blurted out. "Are you trying to trick me, so you lead me in this direction on purpose?"

"Why are you suddenly so agitated?" Alexander looked at him in confusion. "You said you spent so much time with Lawrence, so helping him take out the trash is a normal thing, right? Why use the word 'impossible' to answer me? It's strange; could it be that you were also involved in the murder and dismemberment?"

"I did not!" Brian visibly tensed up. He seemed to be thinking, but only he knew what he was thinking.

After a few seconds of hesitation, Brian seemed to have calmed down, and he answered,"I think I remember helping him take out a trash bag once. Maybe that's when my fingerprints got on it."

Alexander heard Brian admit it and deliberately glanced at the files on the table. "I was mistaken; sorry, the trash bag didn't have your fingerprints."

"Are you messing with me?" Brian suddenly stood up, his eyes bloodshot, staring at Alexander as if he was about to kill him.

Alexander looked at the anxious Brian and smiled even more deeply, but quickly returned to his previous expression. "Mr. Scott, don't be in such a hurry. Why are you so anxious? After all, you didn't kill anyone, right? I just said that our police won't let any bad person go, nor will we wrongfully accuse any good person. And I didn't say the corpse was in the trash bag. You were just helping Lawrence take out his household trash, so why are you so anxious?"

Brian shouted, "No, you just said it!" He remembered that Alexander had clearly mentioned the murder and dismemberment.

He anxiously looked at Dennis next to Alexander, as if seeking confirmation. "Sir, you can't play tricks on an innocent person. He clearly said it just now, how can he deny it now? Isn't this wrongfully accusing me?"

"Cooperate properly; don't shout!" Dennis pounded the table forcefully. "Whether you're wrongfully accused or not, you have the right to request the interrogation footage. What are you afraid of?"

Brian fell silent.

Brian thought that seeking confirmation from Dennis just now was really stupid!

Dennis and Alexander were both police officers; of course, Dennis would side with his colleague.

Thinking of this, Brian suppressed his anger and said, "Whether you mentioned it or not, I'm just an ordinary citizen. If you really had evidence, you wouldn't be wasting your time here and making up lies. I'm telling you, I didn't kill anyone! As for the trash bag, if you visit someone's house and they ask you to take out the trash, isn't that normal? Want to arrest me? Come on, if you can show the real evidence.""

###chapter 35

Alexander saw Brian's intense reaction and decided to remain silent, because asking further would be meaningless.

Brian must have figured out that the police had no evidence, so he wouldn't say anything else.

"Alright, thank you for your cooperation," Alexander politely said goodbye to Brian and left the interrogation room with Dennis.

Brian's main strategy was to deny everything unless there was concrete evidence.

While the Lawrence that Zoey was interrogating was even more shameless than Brian.

No matter what she asked, he admitted to everything, which annoyed Zoey greatly.

Zoey said, "We found your fingerprints on the body disposal bag."

Lawrence looked at her without changing his expression. "I did it. I killed them."

Zoey fell silent.

Lawrence's hands were cuffed, so he couldn't move much, but he could still touch his fingers.

He started counting with his fingers one by one. "Lily, Aria, Stella, I killed them all. I was also stalking Ella, and if it weren't for your appearance, she would have ended up just like the others!"

Lawrence emphasized the last sentence, giving Zoey a deep look. "I just didn't expect Ella to be so lucky, meeting someone like you who would follow a victim for days and nights just to catch me." His words revealed his admiration for Zoey.

He sneered. "You guys are pretty impressive, managing to find the other victims. But there is no use because they're still dead."

Zoey's fists clenched tightly at her waist. She really wanted to beat this bastard up!

Even though he admitted quickly, Zoey was still upset.

He took the lives of three people, and in the end, he only had to forfeit his own life in return. Why?

Charles, noticing Zoey's state, carefully reminded her, "Let's continue."

Zoey responded and asked according to procedure, "Since you killed them all, describe the process in detail."

"What's there to describe?" Lawrence didn't take them seriously at all. "If you have evidence, just sentence me to death, why bother with all this? It's just a matter of following them for a few days, learning their routine. If they're not suitable, find another one. If they are, go to their house, play for a few days, and then kill them."

His words were chillingly casual.

Zoey couldn't stand his indifferent attitude but had to continue the interrogation, "Be more specific! How did you do it, how did you torture the victims, what did you use to kill them, did you strangle them or use tools, and how did you dispose of the bodies? Understand?"

Lawrence yawned. "So troublesome; you guys just ask, and I'll just answer yes or no."

Damn it, Zoey felt the urge to beat him up again.

Maybe it was because she hadn't been a detective for long, and this was the first time she encountered such a shameless and difficult bastard.

Lawrence seemed uncomfortable on the cold bench, shifting his body and looking at Zoey with a provocative and indifferent gaze. "Are you going to ask or not? I have amnesia, so I might forget everything soon."

Zoey didn't respond.

She held back and said, "Do you have a grudge against these people?"

Lawrence simply said, "No."

Zoey asked, "Then why did you choose them as victims?"

Lawrence said, "They're good-looking and easy to control."

Zoey held her breath, suppressing her anger. "Continue."

Lawrence said, "Officer, I am of small stature. If they had boyfriends, no matter how good-looking they were, I couldn't do anything. If those girls were stronger than me, I might not be able to beat them. So, I chose victims who were thinner, easier to control, and I like tall beauties."

Zoey asked, "How long would you follow a victim before making a move?"

Lawrence said, "I wouldn't waste too much time following them, at most half a month. When the opportunity arose, I'd drug them, call a cab, and pretend we were a couple."

"Aren't you afraid of being discovered? Why not use your own car?" Zoey continued to ask, "Isn't that car with the fake license plate yours?"

Lawrence looked at Zoey with disdain, as if mocking her. "Come on, officer, who commits a crime using their own car? That car is mine, but I put a fake plate on it. Usually, Brian drives it; I rarely do."

Zoey was looking for a chance to ask about Brian, but Lawrence brought it up himself.

Zoey asked, "So Brian is your accomplice?"

Lawrence denied, "No, he doesn't know anything."

Zoey was very curious, "Why are you covering for him then? What's in it for you?"

Their relationship couldn't be that good, because this was a murder charge.

Even though Lawrence would be sentenced to death whether he admitted Brian was his accomplice or not, they were police officers, and they couldn't let a murderer go unpunished!

"You and Brian are very close, right? He hasn't missed a weekend at your place for nine months straight, and he doesn't know? Who would believe that?" Charles didn't believe it.

But Lawrence remained calm. "Is it so strange that he doesn't know? When he came over, those victims had already had their vocal cords cut and their kneecaps shattered. Whether they could have a full meal depended on my mood. What could they do? Ask for help? They couldn't even move, so how could they ask for help?One look from me and they would tremble in fear, so they could do nothing."

"Now I'm even more curious." Zoey continued to ask, "With victims in your house, a normal criminal would be afraid of being discovered. Given your reclusive personality, how did you manage to let Brian come over every weekend? Weren't you afraid of being found out?"

Lawrence said, "He's my only friend. His parents don't like him playing video games at home, so he comes to my place to play; what's wrong with that?"

Zoey laughed coldly, finding his reason amusing.

Charles was also speechless.

Zoey pressed, "So, after playing games, Brian helped you dispose of the bodies, right?"

Lawrence snarled, "I told you, it has nothing to do with him! Don't you understand?"

"The evidence is right here and covering for him is useless." Zoey flipped through the records. "Do I need to explain the detailed evidence to you? We know your movements very well. You work Monday to Friday, and you don't leave your house on weekends. On Fridays, only Brian drives that car with the fake plate past Sun Street, so only he had the opportunity to dispose of the bodies."

Lawrence was no longer as calm as before, hesitating for a second. "I have superpowers; do you believe that?"

Zoey and Charles fell silent. Lawrence was being shameless again.

###chapter 36

Zoey and Charles were trying to hold back their laughter and didn't ask Lawrence any questions.

Their attitude was enough to show how ridiculous Lawrence's excuse was.

Lawrence could see they were mocking him, so his tone changed. "I was just joking with you guys, no need to take it seriously. Brian really didn't know about this. Every time he came to my house, I would ask him to take out the trash and he was willing to do it. When I paid him each time, he was even willing to help me throw it into the manhole cover from far away."

"Is that so?" Zoey looked up and glanced at him indifferently. "Show us the transfer records."

Lawrence swallowed hard. "Sorry, I prefer using cash."

"Still covering for him." Zoey gave him a thumbs-up gesture. "Fine, according to you, Brian was just doing a paid job. Now tell us, why did you always dress in women's clothes to approach the victims?"

Zoey meticulously captured all the evidence she had gathered during this period on her phone. She then pointed the screen directly at Lawrence, ensuring he could view it with absolute clarity.

In the video, Lawrence's appearance had nothing to do with a man. At first glance, he looked like a woman.

Lawrence looked at himself in the surveillance footage and laughed. "You guys have found out this much, impressive."

Zoey asked, "Alright, tell us, is this you?"

"Yes, it's me." Lawrence admitted without hesitation, though he was otherwise uncooperative. "I like wearing women's clothes. You must have already investigated my supermarket. Wearing women's clothes helps me better conceal my sexual harassment of them. How's my disguise? Pretty good, right? After each harassment, they never suspected me. After all, it's a public place; I must disguise myself."

"Besides, I wore a hat and mask. The hair was cut from the victims' heads to better disguise myself. How's that? Looks pretty real, right? There's no way fake stuff would work after all. Those women I harassed would never suspect me when they saw my hair."

He even seemed a bit proud, perhaps thinking he was too clever.

From his description, Zoey could imagine the pain the victims had endured.

She looked at Lawrence with eyes full of hatred. "Why did you do this?"

"Do you really need to ask? You're so smart and you've already figured this out. So really do I need to explain it to you?" Lawrence said, savoring the moment. "Only this way could I better choose my victims. I like to target those who don't dare to speak up after being harassed. They usually look insecure and have no friends, so they're easy to manipulate. It turns out that I have a good eye for picking people. As soon as they saw me, they started crying and begging."

There was a hint of enjoyment in his words.

Zoey roughly understood that Lawrence targeted weak women.

She clenched her fists. "So, Lily was the first person you killed."

Lawrence said, "Yes, I killed her."

Zoey occasionally glanced at the notes. "Earlier, when you were stalking Ella, you mentioned having mental issues. Have you seen a doctor?"

Lawrence shrugged and sneered. "What's the point? I don't have that much money to consult a doctor for an incurable disease."

Charles went out of his way to check on his phone; in Emerald City, psychological counseling costed at least $100-200 per hour.

Charles remarked, "That's quite expensive." If it were him, he wouldn't see a doctor either.

Lawrence's shocking words even stunned Charles. "Damn! Are you done questioning? If you're done, hurry up and sentence me. Whatever the court decides, just go with it."

"OK, don't worry, you can't escape punishment," Zoey said with a creepy smile. "By the way, I have to ask, are you gay?"

Lawrence froze for a second, then suddenly tried to get up from the bench.

If it weren't for the handcuffs, he might have jumped up. He shouted, "No, how can you insult me like this? Damn! If I were gay, why wouldn't I catch men? Why catch them?"

Zoey asked, " Exactly. You have a point. But I'm curious, what does Brian have on you? You are not in that kind of relationship, so why are you covering for him?"

Lawrence said, "It wasn't him; why would I frame him? Besides, someone like me is definitely going to hell; I don't need to add more sins."

"Interesting." Zoey chuckled. "You know you're deeply sinful, yet you show kindness to a jerk."

"Yes." When he said the last word, Lawrence's head was so low that his expression was almost invisible. But it was rare to hear a hint of complex emotion in his words.

Zoey knew Lawrence was determined to take the fall for this, so she stopped asking.

She exchanged a glance with Charles and ended the interrogation.

Robert also held an impromptu team meeting.

The two teams reported their interrogation results, and they couldn't understand why Lawrence was so determined to cover for Brian, insisting it had nothing to do with him.

They all sighed in unison. "There are two sets of fingerprints on the body bag. If Lawrence keeps covering for Brian, we won't be able to close the case anytime soon."

Robert looked at everyone and instructed, "Alright, Alexander and Zoey, you two go search Brian's house later, see if there's anything suspicious, and don't miss the office on the second floor of the supermarket!"

Alexander and Zoey said in unison, "Got it!"

Dennis, with his chin in his hand, kept twirling his pen. "I'm really exasperated. Officer Davis, didn't you say only the closest people would take the fall for someone else? I just can't figure it out, what does Brian have on Lawrence that makes him willing to die for him? He's not afraid of death, but he's afraid of what Brian has on him?"

Robert said, "It's normal you can't figure it out, because I haven't figured it out either."

Dennis fell silent. So was Robert praising him or mocking him?

Robert gave Dennis a disdainful look. "Alright, just assume Lawrence has something on Brian at his house; you two go with them! This time, be more thorough in your search, got it?"

Dennis said confidently, "Mission guaranteed!"

###chapter 37

A few people took the search warrant and drove to the neighborhood where Brian lived.

On the way, Alexander and Zoey started discussing the case again, as if the argument at the interrogation room door had never happened.

Alexander asked, "Zoey, what do you think about Lawrence covering for Brian like this?"

"After several interactions with Brian, I don't think he has the ability to manipulate others' minds. It seems more likely that he has some leverage over Lawrence." She looked out the car window, watching the scenery pass by.

Zoey thought, 'What kind of leverage could make Lawrence take all the blame?'

The car fell into silence.

They all wanted to know what this leverage was. But the only two people who knew the truth, one refused to admit it, and the other pretended to know nothing, making it impossible to find out.

Zoey thought for a while and said, "I remember we investigated Brian's family before, right?"

Alexander replied, "Yes, his family is of average economic condition. His parents are still alive, and he has an older sister."

"Okay, I got it." She took out her phone and started chatting with someone.

Alexander guessed she might be consulting someone about Brian's family, checking if there were any recent police records involving them.

He said, "He only started committing crimes this year. Do you think it has something to do with his family?"

Zoey didn't answer his question. Instead, she philosophically said, "The possibility of someone committing a crime always exists. All the evil factors are waiting for an opportunity. When the opportunity comes, the evil reveals itself."

"This is the first time I find you so cultured." Alexander pursed his lips.

Zoey rolled her eyes. "Can you shut up?"

Alexander said, "Zoey, I'm complimenting you. You've made a lot of progress since joining our department. It must be from being around me so much."

Zoey was silent for a moment. How could someone be so shameless?

The next second, she angrily said, "Get lost!"

Alexander fell silent. He thought Zoey really couldn't take a joke.

They drove for a while longer and finally arrived at Brian's house.

They found Brian's house easily by the house number.

Fortunately, everything went smoothly. As soon as they knocked, someone opened the door.

A middle-aged woman, appearing to be in her sixties, glanced at them and, realizing she didn't recognize them at all, was about to inquire who they were.

Alexander took out his badge and flashed it in front of her, saying, "Hello, sorry to bother you. We are police officers from the Emerald City Criminal Investigation Department, here to investigate a case involving the suspect Brian Scott in a serious murder case. May we come in?"

"Murder?" Brian's mother, Zara Jenkins, was stunned upon hearing that. Her first reaction was to block the door. "You must be mistaken! My son may have a bad temper, but he would never dare to kill anyone!"

From her actions and her words-it seemed even she didn't believe what she was saying. Otherwise, why would she block the door?

"No, you misunderstood us." Zoey, with a smile on her face, walked to the door and explained clearly, "Madam, we are only suspecting, not confirming. And we have a search warrant. If you don't let us in, it might delay our evidence collection. If we can't collect evidence, and your son is innocent, wouldn't it delay your son? Then you could also be detained for obstructing police work."

Zoey perfectly used the gentlest tone to say the strongest words. Her logic was clear, giving no room for rebuttal. Finally, she stared at Zara with sharp eyes.

Zara felt uncomfortable under her gaze and immediately looked away.

But she still blocked the door. "Brian is definitely innocent. This is my home and you have no right to force your way in! I'm the owner of this house, and I make the decisions!"

Zoey's patience was running out. She had said all the nice things. And Zara still wanted to play tough?

Alexander held Zoey's arm and walked closer with the search warrant, trying to make Zara see it more clearly. He explained, "Madam, do you see this warrant? We are not forcing our way in. It gives the police the right to forcibly enter a suspect's residence for a search without anyone's consent. Do you understand?"

Zara said, "I never go to school, so I don't understand the law; I don't even know what it says!  Unless I'm sure you are police officers, none of you are getting into my house! Anyway, I'm sick. If you dare to force your way in, I'll have a fit and show you!"

Alexander fell silent.

He finally understood where Brian's stubbornness came from; it was genetic.

Alexander took a deep breath, feeling helpless with Zara.

He turned around, intending to discuss alternative solutions with Zoey. In that instant, he saw Zoey with a cold expression, extending her hand to grasp Zara's shoulder, poised to execute an over-the-shoulder throw. But halfway through the move, Zoey seemed to remember Zara's age and showed some mercy. In the end, she pushed Zara.

In Alexander's eyes, it was a light push, while Zara, losing her balance, was about to fall backward. Fortunately, Alexander quickly grabbed her.

Zoey took the opportunity to stride into the house.

"Oh my God! They actually forcetheir way into my home in broad daylight!" Zara sat on the ground, wailing.

Zoey glanced at her indifferently. "Do you need me to call the police for you? You can shout inside the police station. There are more people there."

Zara fell silent. After all, her age commanded respect in this harmonious society, and wherever she went, people treated her with reverence. Now, nearly being assaulted by Zoey, she was infuriated.

"You... you are a disgrace to the police as you don't even respect the elderly. How dare you call yourself a police officer!" Zara's fingers trembled as she pointed at Zoey and scolded her.

Zoey completely ignored her. "Madam, I'm helping you. If you obstruct our investigation, you could be detained. You said you are sick. If you have a fit in the detention center, then what should you do? No need to thank me. I usually do good deeds without leaving my name."

Zara looked at her hateful face, exasperated.

Alexander was really afraid Zara would get seriously ill from anger and quietly reminded Zoey, "Alright, stop talking."

###chapter 38

Had they depended solely on Alexander's persuasion to gain access, they wouldn't have even made it through the door. The more Zoey thought about it, the more infuriated she became. Then she cast a vexed glance at Alexander.

Alexander felt wronged; he was just trying to give a friendly reminder. But fortunately, they did get in.

Zoey put on disposable gloves and started searching Brian's house.

Zara got up to stop her while making a phone call. "You need to come back right now! If you don't, our house will be taken over! Police officers have forcibly entered the house and are attacking me. I'm about to be beaten to death."

On the other end of the line, Brian's father, Roy Scott, not knowing what was happening, heard Zara's dangerous situation and quickly said, "I'm coming back right now!"

After hanging up, Zara started acting shamelessly. No matter where Alexander went, she clung to his arm, not letting him move. However, she didn't dare touch Zoey.

"What you're doing is illegal, you know? Breaking the law makes it worse! I'm going to sue you! None of you will get away!" Zara snarled. She didn't dare get close to Zoey; she felt that this female cop was a bit scary and not someone she could mess with.

So she kept holding onto Alexander, spouting threats.

The house wasn't very large, with only three bedrooms. Once you excluded the common areas, you could easily see the kitchen and living room at a glance.

Zoey opened each room and took a look; there was nothing special.

One room looked like the master bedroom, with a wedding photo of Brian's parents hanging above the bed.

Another room was clearly decorated for a girl. Since Brian had a sister, it must have been designed for her.

The last room must be Brian's!

Zoey's eyes suddenly turned sharp, and she quickly walked to the door of Brian's bedroom.

Her hand grasped the doorknob, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't push it open. She attempted a couple more times with increased force, yet it still wouldn't budge. It was obvious the door was locked!

Zoey had no patience for Zara. She ordered, "Open the door!"

"You're lucky to even be in my house. What right do you have to order me to open the door?" Zara's anger didn't diminish as she spoke in the strongest tone with the weakest words, "Besides, Brian usually doesn't let us in. We can't get in ourselves, so how can we open it for you?"

Alexander asked, "No spare key?"

Zara replied, "No, none."

"No problem." Alexander could see she didn't want to get the key and started making a call. "This lock is simple. We've encountered many like it in our cases. Any locksmith can easily open it."

Zoey didn't want to waste time with her. She could tell Zara was faking it.

"Madam, I'm trying to be reasonable with you. I'll say it one more time; get the spare key now, or I'll arrest you and take you to the detention center!"

Zara emphasizd, "I really don't have it."

Before Zara could finish speaking, Zoey turned around and kicked the door open with a swift move.

Besides Zoey, who kicked the door, Alexander and Zara were both stunned.

The air seemed to freeze at that moment.

Zara thought, 'This isn't a cop; this is a gangster!'

Zoey smoothly retracted her foot and looked at the broken door, feeling very satisfied.

"You... You actually kicked down our door! Not only did you forcibly enter, but you also damaged private property!" Zara was on the verge of losing her mind, thinking Zoey might truly be insane.

Zoey said, "Don't worry; the police department will compensate you."

Zoey finished speaking and walked into Brian's bedroom.

Alexander, seeing Zara's stunned expression, was a bit worried about Zoey getting a complaint. He said to Zara, "You were too hasty just now. We could have waited for a locksmith; it would have only taken half an hour."

Zara said, "I couldn't wait; I'm hungry."

Alexander fell silent.

Alexander said, "If she sues you, she'll definitely win." The law clearly states that you can't use excessive force and must protect citizens' rights.

Zoey found it laughable and asked, "Then she'd be suing me, so why are you worried?"

Alexander said helplessly, "Why don't you ever listen to reason?"

"How am I not listening? If I had listened, we wouldn't have even gotten in!" Zoey said nonchalantly while scanning the room's layout. "You've been in the detective department for so long, and you don't know that if the police cause damage to someone's property during a search, they have to compensate, unless the damage is due to the person being searched hiding stolen goods or evidence?"

Alexander was confused. "Of course I know, but why bother causing unnecessary trouble for yourself?"

Zoey couldn't stand Alexander anymore. "If you don't want to investigate, you can leave."

Alexander said, "I won't say it anymore.""

Brian's bedroom wasn't large, just under 200 square feet.

They could only see a bed, a wardrobe, and a desk inside. The bed was piled with clothes, emitting a foul smell.

Compared to Lawrence's house, Brian's place seemed more fitting for a single, messy guy.

Zoey opened the window in exasperation.

The fresh air from outside diluted the stench a bit.

She finally felt a bit more comfortable. Her caught sight of the overflowing trash can, and she glanced at Alexander, who was also seriously inspecting the room.

She selfishly said, "You search the bed and wardrobe; I'll check the desk, okay?"

Alexander agreed, "Sure."

Zoey walked to the desk and immediately saw its cluttered state. There were several storage racks and a pile of books.

She flipped through them casually; there were all kinds of books, and she even found two erotic novels.

The drawers were also a mess, filled with random items, which were placed haphazardly. It looked chaotic but contained everyday necessities, nothing special.

She found that the bottom drawer of the desk was locked.

Zoey thought there might be some 'evidence' inside and yanked it open with force.

Alexander noticed the noise and looked over. Zoey disdainfully closed the drawer when she discovered it contained sex toys.

Alexander, seeing Zoey's impatience, softly said, "Aren't you afraid she'll complain about you? Can you be a bit gentler?"

Zoey said, "Nothing's broken!" The items were still intact."

Alexander fell silent.

###chapter 39

Due to the limited items in the room, it didn't take long to search everything.

The two of them almost finished searching in no time.

Everything in sight had nothing to do with the crime.

Despite her disdain, she maintained her professionalism as a good police officer. She put on two masks before examining the clothes to ensure that the strange odors wouldn't reach her nose.

She searched almost every piece, seriously asking Alexander, "Are all men this messy?"

"I'm not like this. No matter how late I get off work, I always take a shower and have the maid wash my clothes," Alexander said, showcasing his wealth to the fullest.

She looked at him with the same disdain she had for the clothes.

She was wrong; she shouldn't have asked him. After all, he was the young master of the Edwards Family, who didn't need to do anything himself.

When a child from an ordinary family got accepted into the police academy, no matter how exhausting it was, they must persevere. This was called hard work. While Alexander was just here to experience life.

In the police profession, no mistakes were allowed; you must always be on high alert to ensure no criminal was missed.

She suddenly thought of the question Robert had asked her before. "How did your parents agree to let you apply for criminal investigation?"

At this moment, Zoey also suddenly wanted to ask Alexander!

Seeing Alexander seriously searching the blankets and pillowcases in the room, she held back her urge to mock him. Finding evidence was the top priority after all.

The two of them almost tore the room apart to find some clues in Brian's room. Yet, they still found nothing.

"I don't believe there's nothing in Brian's house," Zoey said calmly and coolly.

Alexander also agreed with her, "From his family's obstruction and the locked room, there must be some evidence in this room that we haven't found."

"Yeah... so..." After saying this, Zoey and Alexander both looked at the mattress.

They had searched everything in the room, and now only the mattress was left.

Then Alexander and Zoey lifted the mattress to start searching together.

Zoey and Alexander cooperated very well.

Zoey carefully felt the mattress to see if anything was hidden inside, while Alexander checked the four corners of the mattress for any discoveries.

After searching the side of the bed near the door, they lifted the mattress together again.

As the heavy mattress moved, a silver USB drive suddenly fell to the floor.

The sound of it hitting the floor was quite crisp.

They found it! They finally found it.

Both of them looked at the USB drive on the floor. Just as Alexander was about to bend down to pick it up, another hand snatched it first.

"Hiding it deep is useless," Zoey said proudly.

Zoey's expression was calm, and the tension in her eyes had disappeared, replaced by a hint of prid

"See it?" She waved it in front of Alexander.

Alexander nodded. "I see it."

"If I had waited for you to find a locksmith, this evidence might have been moved somewhere unknown," Zoey said, with a bit of a lecturing tone.

She thought Alexander needed to learn some basic knowledge and the evil of human nature.

"Okay, I'll definitely learn more from Ms. Brown in the future," Alexander knew well that what Zoey said could happen because of Zara's unreasonable behavior

"Yes, you should learn more," Zoey put the USB drive in the evidence bag, giving him a cold look, "This lesson is called, 'Act instead of talk.'"

Alexander was silent. Her words seemed to carry some resentment.

They took the USB drive back to the station.

Seeing Brian's room almost torn apart by the two, Zara suddenly felt a sharp pain in her chest!

Zara thought, 'I must sue Zoey, that female robber!'

Then the entire criminal investigation team gathered, inserted the USB drive into the laptop. Everyone stared intently.

"This Brian! Can he even be considered human?" Dennis's hand, holding the mouse, was trembling with anger. He said in rage,  "Even though these photos can't convict him, I still want to beat him up!"

"Disgusting," Charles was just as angry as Dennis. His hand clenched into a fist, hitting the table unconsciously.

Compared to their anger, Zoey and Alexander seemed a bit calmer.

Zoey took the mouse from Dennis's hand and began enlarging each angle of the photos, examining the details, and started comparing the photos of the women secretly taken.

There were about a thousand photos in the USB drive, with each girl appearing only three to four times on average.

The photos were all taken of rather sensitive areas, mainly including under the skirt, thighs, face, and chest。

These photos would make any man blush because they were too perverted. Despite being the only woman here, Zoey was calmer than anyone else as she flipped through the photos in front of three or four men.

She even took a piece of paper and a pen, planning to jot down some notes.

Alexander came over, curious, and asked, "Zoey, did you find something? What are you noting down?"

Zoey said, "No time for a lesson today; don't bother me!"

Alexander was silent, slinking back to his seat.

His eyes could only follow Zoey as she flipped through the photos, looking at the victims in them.

Finally, when Zoey reached the 536th photo, she paused at the sight of familiar red hair.

The hair was particularly beautiful, and as a woman, Zoey remembered it vividly.

Zoey immediately clicked to the next photo, where the red-haired woman was wearing the same outfit as before, turned around, and even had light makeup on, looking somewhat pretty.

If they hadn't met Lawrence before, they might have been fooled. Just as Lawrence said, they might never have traced it back to him in their lifetime. Yes, the man in the photo was Lawrence!

"This is even more disgusting than I thought!" Dennis felt nauseated. "What the hell is going on?"

###chapter 40

Charles had an extraordinary ability with photos and videos. His first reaction was to glance at the date below the photo. He remarked, "It's been ten months since then!" He calculated the days and speculated, "According to the date on the photo, Brian knew Lawrence liked women's clothing a long time ago."

Alexander added, "When we first went to Lawrence's supermarket to take their statements, Brian didn't say that."

Brian's personality had left quite an impression on them. They had a particularly vivid memory of him from the day they took his statement:

Alexander said, "I clearly remember Brian telling us that Lawrence just liked to bring women's clothing to work, but he never said he had seen Lawrence wearing them. And ten months ago, there wasn't a single victim."

However, the tragic incidents had only started happening in the past six months.

Zoey downloaded all the photos related to Lawrence onto the desktop. She began clicking through them one by one.

When she reached the third photo, she felt a pair of cold hands cover her eyes.

At the same time, Dennis and Charles cursed in her ear, "What a pervert! Fuck!"

Zoey's eyes were covered, and she couldn't see anything.

She was very curious about what they were cursing at.

Zoey instinctively tried to push the hands away from her eyes, but she couldn't move them.

Alexander's voice came from beside her, "You can't look at this."

Zoey was speechless. "I'm solving a case!"

Alexander said, "Even if you're solving a case, you can't look at this. One more photo won't solve the case."

Zoey fell silent. Could someone control Alexander?

Dennis and Charles looked at the photo and agreed that Alexander was right. They both tried to comfort her, "Yeah, Zoey, listen to Alexander. One photo won't solve the case. If you want to know something, let Alexander describe it to you later."

Alexander twitched his mouth. Who could tell him how to describe this?

To prevent Zoey from seeing it, Dennis quickly clicked back to the normal photo interface and exchanged a glance with Alexander.

Alexander then released his hands from Zoey's eyes.

Zoey stared at Alexander and questioned, "Alexander, you're delaying my investigation!"

Alexander took a deep breath, "To avoid delaying your investigation, should I describe it to you?"

There were only a few of them in the office. Dennis and Charles both supported Alexander's behaviour before. This meant that the content of the photo was definitely not something good.

Zoey compromised and stopped trying to look at it, but she still wanted to know what the photos were. Could they be nude photos of Lawrence?

Seeing Zoey's eager expression, Alexander took a deep breath and tried to describe it as tactfully as possible, "It's about two people of the same gender doing some indescribable things."

Zoey looked at Alexander's stammering and guessed what he meant, asking, "A video of two men having sex?"

Alexander nodded. "Yes."

Zoey asked again, "Lawrence and Brian?"

Alexander nodded again. "Yes."

At this moment, Zoey was genuinely grateful to Alexander for covering her eyes, so she didn't have to see Brian naked!

She wasn't interested at all! Both Lawrence and Brian were so disgusting that just the thought of seeing them having sex would keep her up at night!

She didn't argue with Alexander about what he had done to her.

Alexander lightly coughed, trying to ease the awkward atmosphere.

He simply shifted the topic back to the case. "I still don't understand. Lawrence just has a nude photo in Brian's hands. It's not enough to cover for Brian, right? He's not afraid of death, so what is he afraid of? And since we've caught Brian, can't Lawrence use the stuff on the USB drive to clear his name? What exactly is Lawrence afraid of?"

Zoey couldn't figure out the logic either and asked, "Could it be that Lawrence is not only a pervert but also mentally ill?"

When they caught him before, didn't he say so himself? No mentally normal person would do such things. Lawrence wasn't married, so even if this got exposed, he could just move to another city and he didn't need to fear Brian. This clearly couldn't be used by Brian to control Lawrence.

The case hit a dead end again, and the whole team sighed in unison. What was the connection between them?

"So frustrating!" Dennis scratched his head in frustration. "Should I just go beat up Lawrence and force him to talk?"

No one agreed with him; it was clearly a bad idea.

The atmosphere became awkward again. Dennis saw his teammates deep in thought and remained silent.

At this moment, Charles suddenly remembered something. "I think I saw a similar plot in a TV show I forgot!"

Dennis immediately looked at him, waiting for him to continue.

Charles quickly returned to his desk, rummaging through it, and found a smartphone and an evidence bag. As he turned on the phone, he said, "This is what Dennis and I found. How could I forget about this!"

As he said, he turned on the phone in the evidence bag.

Charles continued, "This was in an employee's locker at the supermarket. One of the employees' slots was taken over by Brian. When we went there, the employee was complaining to a colleague about this. We wanted to know what was inside, and it turned out to be this. We originally planned to take a look, but then we heard you found the USB drive and completely forgot about it."

Dennis couldn't understand their thoughts. He just wanted to know what kind of plot it was! Who wrote such a perverted TV show?

"It's locked. Looks like we got excited for nothing." Charles put the phone back in the evidence bag and said to Dennis, "The plot was about the perpetrator putting the leverage in a scheduled email. If the person being threatened didn't comply, it would be sent immediately."

"Oh, so this phone must have some big secrets?" Dennis's eyes lit up as he looked at the phone in Charles's hand.

Unfortunately, they didn't have the password. The quickest way was to ask Brian.

Thinking about Brian's indifferent attitude during interrogation, would he admit it? He was probably trying to stall for time.

Alexander suggested, "We better send it to the tech department immediately!"

"On it!" Charles excitedly left the team with the phone.

Of the remaining three, two were happy; one was worried.

Zoey sighed deeply, "Honestly, I don't have high hopes for this phone suddenly appearing."

###chapter 41

"What's going on?" Alexander noticed her melancholy and asked.

Zoey voiced her thoughts, "Even if Lawrence admits that Brian is an accomplice, so what? Without evidence of Brian committing murder, he will definitely deny it. He can just say Lawrence is slandering him and get away with it."

Lawrence would still be sentenced to death.

Even if Brian went to jail, he wouldn't be there for long. Sooner or later, he would be out and back to his old ways

Zoey hated such an outcome. In her mind, all criminals should pay for the bad things they have done! No one should be an exception.

"Stay positive, what if Lawrence suddenly figures it out?" Alexander comforted her.

Zoey didn't say anything more.

When they discussed the case, time always seemed to fly by. It was still noon when they gathered, but in the blink of an eye, it was already dark outside.

Zoey glanced at the time; it was already 8 PM.

Charles wouldn't be back so soon, so Dennis suggested, "Why don't we go to the cafeteria first? Otherwise, it will close soon."

Zoey was naturally the first to agree. When it came to eating, she would never back down.

As Alexander saw Zoey already getting up, a smile unconsciously appeared on his lips. It seemed her only hobby was eating?

The three of them went to the cafeteria one after another. The two men took less food than Zoey, even though she was just one woman.

Dennis saw Zoey's lunchbox piled high like a small mountain and couldn't help but give her a thumbs up, "Zoey, you have a great appetite."

"Yeah, I'm still growing," Zoey said as she ate.

Dennis and Alexander exchanged a glance, both impressed by Zoey. They really had no other response to that reason.

After a while, they finished eating and didn't forget to bring a portion of pasta for Charles.

Soon, Charles returned.

Seeing the pasta on his seat, he knew his teammates had brought it for him. He thanked them and handed them his unlocked phone, then buried his head in his food.

"The tech department told me that they did find a scheduled email, and its content was indeed those photos we discovered," Charles said, his mouth full of noodles, a hint of smugness in his voice as he spoke.

His guess was correct! As he was afraid that they wouldn't find the software, Charles pointed it out with his hand. "It's this one."

"Nice job, Charles!" Dennis looked at Charles with newfound respect, saying, "I'll go update Officer Davis with the latest news. You guys get ready for the interrogation!"

Alexander got up to prepare the materials needed for the interrogation.

As Zoey observed that Charles enjoyed his food, she remarked, "This pasta looks good."

Charles said, "Of course, it's good. Let me tell you, you should stick with me. I'm good friends with one of the chefs in the kitchen, and she cooks really well! I'll take you to try it next time."

Zoey nodded. "No problem!"

Alexander unintentionally glanced up and saw Zoey joking with Charles, feeling inexplicably uncomfortable.

Alexander asked, "Zoey, are you ready?"

"Yes, I'm ready," Zoey responded, her tone cold as usual.

Alexander didn't know what he had done to offend her. But there was nothing he could do, so he had to endure it. After all, Zoey was a girl, and he had to be considerate of her.Hearing they were leaving, Charles started shoveling pasta into his mouth. "Wait for me; let's go together!"

As they left the criminal investigation department, they headed towards the interrogation room.

Dennis had just finished talking with Robert and found the group. He said, "Officer Davis is still in a meeting and won't be available for a while. He asked us to start the interrogation."

Zoey nodded. "Alright."

Zoey and Charles paired up again.

Alexander and Dennis also paired up.

The two groups, as assigned by Robert last time, naturally teamed up again.

Just as they were about to enter the interrogation room, Alexander paused and called out to Zoey, 'About what you asked me to find out about Lawrence's sister, I did ask. Other than secretly wearing his sister's dress when he was young and getting caught and punished by his parents, there's nothing else. His family describes him as very obedient.'"

Was it because Lawrence was socially anxious and didn't want to interact with others, giving the impression of being timid and not as tall as other men, that his family defined him as obedient for not fighting?

Zoey said, "Thanks."

Alexander replied, "You're welcome."

Then Alexander turned and walked to their respective interrogation rooms with Zoey.

After a few days, Lawrence's condition seemed noticeably worse than during the previous interrogation. He looked like a different person, with stubble growing on his once clean-shaven face, appearing somewhat haggard

Seeing the two of them again, his eyes seemed devoid of basic emotions, and he said directly, "I've already told you, I did it all. You can just sentence me. There's no need to keep asking, wasting both our time."

Zoey looked at his state, knowing they wouldn't get anything out of him this time either.

She decided not to ask him about the case. Then she closed all the files and notes related to the case.

Zoey asked, "Lawrence, I'm really curious, why do you like wearing women's clothes?"

Lawrence didn't expect her to ask this question, and his attention seemed to focus a bit because of it. He looked up and asked, "Does this have anything to do with the murder?"

Zoey said, "No, I'm just really curious."

Lawrence retorted, "Just because you're curious, I have to tell you?"

Seeing him so agitated, Zoey's suspicions seemed to be confirmed. "Lawrence, did you stop liking wearing women's clothes a long time ago?"

The expression on Lawrence's face began to change, and he looked at Zoey with flickering eyes. "What do you mean?"

Zoey continued nonchalantly, 'I almost forgot, I need to be more explicit, otherwise you probably still won't want to talk.' She said, 'The reason you don't like women's clothing is because of the molestation you experienced.'"

"What did you say?" Lawrence's rare change in emotion showed he was visibly agitated.

Zoey took out her phone, then silently put it back and handed a USB drive to Charles.

Charles instantly understood her intention, plugged the USB drive into the laptop, and turned the screen towards Lawrence so he could see more clearly.

As the mouse clicked on the page, two intertwined bodies appeared on the screen.

Seeing the naked images of himself and Brian on the screen, Lawrence immediately closed his eyes and shouted angrily, "Turn it off! Turn it off!"

"Lawrence, you should thank Charles. He found the software controlling your phone," Zoey said, pointing to Charles beside her.

###chapter 42

Charles followed up, "I found Brian's phone in your supermarket locker, and our tech team also canceled the scheduled emails he was going to send to your family. You shouldn't have any concerns now. Besides..." He paused and continued, "As a man, what does it matter if you're exposed? And why would you take the fall for Brian?"

This was something they never understood.

But Lawrence wasn't listening to anything now. Fear flashed in his eyes as he avoided their gaze.

"Turn it off; turn it off!" He became increasingly agitated, muttering incessantly.

To keep Lawrence calm and quiet, Zoey gave Charles a look. Charles understood immediately and quickly turned off the photos on the laptop.

"I have turned it off," Charles said flatly.

Lawrence, breathing heavily with his head down, took a while to lift his eyes and refocus on the two interrogating him.

Zoey seized the moment and quickly asked, "So, do you still want to take the fall for Brian? Even though we stopped him from using the evidence he had, are you still planning to take all the blame yourself?"

Lawrence's eyes lowered, and he remained silent.

Charles watched him for a few seconds and then continued, "Lawrence, our patience is limited. Don't keep testing the limits of the police!"

Lawrence glanced at Charles and then lowered his head again, remaining silent.

Charles was silent.

Zoey knew Lawrence wouldn't talk for a while.

She organized the files on the table and then slammed them down. She snapped, "Lawrence, I gave you a chance, but you didn't take it. Fine, since you're not talking, I'll send these things to your family right now." 

As she spoke, she took out her phone and was about to hit send.

Charles was stunned.

Charles asked, "This... isn't quite by the book, is it?"

Lawrence was also at a loss. Wasn't Zoey a police officer? She even had a police badge, but how could Zoey speak with such a reckless ton

Lawrence was a bit panicked. "If you do this, it's an invasion of my privacy! I'll sue you!"

Zoey said with an indifferent tone, "Sue me? Fine, you're not afraid of anything, not even death, so why fear these photos being leaked? Let me tell you, Lawrence, it's because you're not cooperating with our investigation. I'm just following protocol by informing your family of your crimes."

Zoey continued calmly, "Otherwise, if your family asks me why you committed the crime, what should I say? You tell me."

Besides, what Lawrence was involved in was indeed related to the case. According to the law, family members had the right to know the details of the crime and could attend court hearings.

Lawrence was so furious that he clenched his fists tightly and pounded the table.

His eyes were filled with murderous intent. Lawrence snarled, "As a police officer, you actually say the same things as Brian! You're despicable! You disgrace the police! I demand a different interrogator! Right now!"

Seeing Lawrence treat Zoey this way, Charles also slammed the table in anger and said, "Lawrence, this is your first warning. Do not insult the police!"

Before he could finish his sentence, Zoey was exasperated by Lawrence's behaviour and intervened, "Lawrence, do you think you're the victim here? You think you can choose who interrogates you? Compared to dealing with a ruthless serial killer like you, my actions have been far too courteous."

"Yes, you're right, I'm despicable. So what?" Zoey wasn't angry; she looked at him seriously, her eyes full of threat.She said, "Dealing with someone like you requires a different approach than that of a gentleman! So, are you going to talk or not? Just answer this one question."

Charles was speechless. It was his first time seeing Zoey's aggressive interrogation.

Although it was somewhat unorthodox, he found Zoey increasingly impressive.

Charles initially wanted to persuade Zoey, considering that the entire interrogation was being recorded. It wouldn't be worth it to let a death row inmate like Lawrence cause any trouble."

He was about to pull Zoey's sleeve to stop her from speaking further.

Unexpectedly, a familiar voice interrupted.

Lawrence's molars were almost grinding to pieces. He took several deep breaths, trying to appear calm. Then he said, "You go ahead; tell me what you know and what you want to know."

Charles was puzzled. Really? Did this work? Lawrence was giving in?

Zoey glanced at Lawrence with disdain and sat back down. "We know everything we need to know, except for the evidence in your hands."

She was so confident, as if she was sure Lawrence had evidence of Brian's murders.

Zoey's confidence made Lawrence look at her with newfound respect.

Zoey, who seemed like a recent college graduate, spoke so arrogantly. In their few encounters, he had come to admire Zoey. At least, he was afraid of her.

Lawrence said, "Go ahead, as long as what you know matches what I have, I'll explain everything in detail."

Lawrence's attitude was no longer as agitated, and his eyes were much clearer than before. It seemed he had come to terms with it.

Compared to previous interrogations, Charles saw Lawrence finally showing signs of confessing this time.

Zoey, seeing that Lawrence was convinced, got to the point, "I know you're quite pitiful; you merely have a fetish for women's clothing. But Brian, that beast, has something on you. I also know you two aren't close. It's only because Brian has evidence against you and you don't want others to find out that you're following his orders."

Zoey said, "You two worked in the same supermarket, seeing each other every day, hiding such a big secret from your colleagues. That's why you shared an office with Brian, right? You have a cross-dressing fetish; while Brian is a sexual deviant. Quite the pair."

"The first time you went out dressed as a woman, you encountered a thug. Instinctively, you dodged his hand with a large movement. When his hand landed on you again, you turned around angrily and realized it was Brian."

"Soon, your nightmare began." Zoey seemed to recall the scene of their first encounter and laughed before continuing, "Actually, Brian was also startled when he saw it was you. You begged him to delete the photos he took. But you didn't expect that while you just had a cross-dressing fetish, Brian was a real pervert. Seeing you in women's clothes, he developed feelings for you. If you didn't comply, he would tell your family about your fetish. You had no choice but to obey."

###chapter 43

Zoey couldn't help but sigh again. "It's a pity that in your prime, you never had a girlfriend, but you gave your first time to a pervert like Brian."

"So, you wanted to leave this city and start fresh somewhere else. But you didn't expect Brian to record your sex video. And because of the video in his hands, you had to obey him. You didn't want to worry your family or face their judgment."

Lawrence listened quietly to Zoey's statement. His face grew increasingly grim. There was even a murderous look in his eyes.

Zoey observed Lawrence out of the corner of her eye and took a deep breath. "You didn't want to disappoint your family because you remember the look in your parents' eyes when you were a kid and got caught wearing your sister's dress. So, you had no choice but to endure Brian's humiliation to keep this secret. Brian was only interested in you for a while; after he got you, he still craved real women. He told you that if you didn't want to have sex with him, you had to find someone to replace you."

"In order to temporarily get away from him, you started becoming his accomplice, finding targets for him and kidnapping victims."

"In the statement Brian gave us, he mentioned that he always chose timid women who wouldn't cause trouble. Such women were easy to bully, wouldn't make a fuss, and were easy to control. He said that when you dressed as a woman and mingled in public, no one could tell. This made it easier to find targets in public places, and even if you encountered a difficult woman, no one would suspect you."

"You specifically targeted out-of-towners who came to this city, right? Height, appearance, everything was according to Brian's preferences. Even when kidnapping the first victim, Brian would tell you, 'I'll just sleep with them a few times and let them go when I am fed up with them. Women are naturally meant to have sex with men; I'm just doing single women a favor.'"

"You believed him, but Brian broke his promise. Those women begged him to let them go, but not only did he refuse, he also slit their throats and shattered their knees with a hammer. At that moment, you were terrified. You even pleaded with him for the victims, but he remained unmoved. Instead, he came over to threaten you, saying that if you uttered a single word, your fate would be even worse than theirs."

"Then you were terrified, and stopped pleading. You watched as those kidnapped women were played with, tortured, and dismembered."

"After the first time, Brian didn't restrain himself but became even more excessive. Every so often, he would threaten you to do his bidding. I can almost imagine what he said to you. His point was probably that killing one person is a death sentence, killing two is the same, and even if it means exchanging lives, he wouldn't be the one to suffer."

"Then Lily, Aria, Stella... all fell victim to his cruelty. He even told you that if the police ever found you, you should take all the blame, and he would take care of your family."

Lawrence's smile was stiff, with a hint of relief. Then he said, "Yes, you guessed it all..."

"I'm not done yet, don't rush." Zoey squinted and smiled at Lawrence. "You actually didn't care about the leverage Brian had over you. The reason you chose to take all the blame is simple."

Lawrence looked up at her expectantly.

Zoey calmly said, "It's because you like him."

This statement was not a question but a declaration.

Charles was puzzled. How did Lawrence end up liking Brian? Wasn't this development a bit off track?

Zoey's imagined scenario left Lawrence stunned for a moment. Then he snapped out of it and started cursing, "I would never like him! I hate him! Everything I did was because my parents are in poor health, and I was afraid something would happen to them."

Zoey asked, " So when you killed someone and faced the death penalty, you weren't afraid something would happen to your parents?"

Lawrence was stumped again and he lowered his head in silence.

Zoey said, "Alright, stop deceiving yourself. You have a certain degree of gender dysphoria, which is why you liked Brian. You might not understand what I'm saying right now, but this is a common manifestation of gender dysphoria."

Lawrence shouted, "Fuck! I could never like him!"

Lawrence's emotions were more intense than Brian's. To control the situation, Charles knocked on the table. "Order!"

"All the evidence of Brian's murders is in the water tank of the company restroom!" Lawrence looked at Zoey with disdain. "Do you still think I like him now?"

Zoey successfully obtained the evidence and looked at him with satisfaction. "OK, thank you for your cooperation."

Then She got up to leave.

Lawrence's urgent voice came from the interrogation room. "Wait a minute!"

Zoey and Charles turned back to see Lawrence's calm eyes, even with a hint of urgency. Lawrence said, "I have to admit, your ability to extract information is better than many police officers. But now I want to ask you a question. As you said earlier, I was threatened throughout the whole case. Will I still get the death penalty?"

Zoey said, "I just wanted to know Brian's crimes from your mouth. If you want to live, tell me the detailed specifics between you two, and I might be willing to listen."

Zoey didn't sit down but turned slightly, saying, "Don't you think Brian is a pervert and forget that you're also a pervert? You cut off the scalp tissue of those victims, didn't you? Because you wanted beautiful, real hair for a long time?"

"And based on my analysis, Brian always liked to secretly film women with hot bodies and big breasts. But these victims were far from his preferences. Is it too much to suspect that these victims were chosen according to your taste?"

"Brian only stayed here for two days a week. You spent the most time with those women. Do you need me to help you recall how you treated them in detail?"

"Did you help them dress, combeb their hair, or just quietly enjoy their pleading looks?"

Zoey looked at Lawrence with a judgmental gaze and said, 'A man liking women's clothing is simply about liking the clothes. But some people, because they are incapable of obtaining what they desire, transform themselves into the very thing they like. So, you and Brian are the same kind of people in a way."

Lawrence's hands clenched tightly, casting a shadow over his brow.

No one knew what he was thinking at that moment. That feeling of having his secrets exposed was truly unpleasant.

###chapter 44

Zoey saw that Lawrence had fallen silent, and her gaze turned cold.

Zoey thought, "Someone like Lawrence, who disregards human life, is a danger to society if allowed to live!'

Charles also let out a sigh of relief, then followed Zoey out of the interrogation room.

Afterwards, Dennis and Charles immediately went to Lawrence's supermarket and quickly found the USB drive with evidence of Brian's crimes at the location Lawrence provided.

Although the video had obvious editing marks, it was enough to sentence Brian to death.

The footage recorded every cruel moment of how he tortured the victims.

Then the serial disappearance and murder case was declared closed.

The entire first criminal investigation team's tense nerves finally relaxed.

Zoey finished writing the case report, stretched, and planned to get a late-night snack.

Alexander happened to stand up at the same time as her, so they went to the cafeteria together.

Zoey took everything she liked, even more than usual.

Alexander looked at the food she took, then at her, and kindly reminded, "Eating so much at night won't be good for your digestion."

Zoey didn't even look at him, focusing on her food.

Alexander wasn't actually hungry, but for some unknown reason, he felt compelled to follow when he saw Zoey going out.

To avoid appearing too deliberate, he casually grabbed some snacks as a cover.

Seeing Zoey eat so heartily, Alexander couldn't help but ask, "So, during the interrogation, you said Lawrence liked Brian. Is that true?"

Zoey paused her eating and looked at him strangely, "Why are you so curious about the story between two men?"

Alexander was silent. He was just asking out of curiosity. Why did he sense something else in Zoey's words? Was she suspecting he was gay? Nonsense!

Just as Alexander was about to prove his sexual orientation to Zoey, she deliberately looked away and continued eating. She said, "I don't know, anyway, getting the evidence was my ultimate goal."

Alexander said, "Oh, I thought Lawrence might have Stockholm syndrome with Brian. After all, this kind of case isn't rare. Many victims participate in crimes after being victimized. I thought his involvement might be related to that."

Zoey glanced at him. "I can't say it has no relation, but it's not significant. Do you remember what I once said? The possibility of someone committing a crime always exists; all the evil factors are just waiting for an opportunity. When the opportunity comes, the evil reveals itself."

She continued, "Lawrence was a pervert to begin with. He liked wearing women's clothes because he was a pervert, not just a fetish."

"Why do you say that?" Alexander was curious.

"When Brian secretly filmed him in short skirts, crop tops, and blonde wigs, he was very open about showing his body. But later, when harassing victims, he dressed very conservatively. If it weren't for the long hair and the color of the clothes, it would be hard to tell his gender."

"He started dressing scantily, looking very confident. But later, he dressed more and more conservatively to reduce his presence. His dressing style reflected his inner state. Lawrence probably started liking women's clothes, found it thrilling, and then rejected it."

"Because he was raped by Brian?" Alexander asked, puzzled.

Zoey said, "Well, to be more precise, after being assaulted by Brian, the significance of women's clothing changed for him. Previously, those pretty dresses could bring him perverse sexual fantasies, which was understandable since he didn't have a girlfriend. When he masturbated while wearing a dress, it was as if he was freely touching any woman on the street."

Listening to Zoey, Alexander couldn't stand it and cursed, "He's really a pervert!"

Zoey nonchalantly glanced at him. "Don't all men masturbate? Lawrence is just a bit more perverted."

Alexander was silent. Why did he feel like Zoey was attacking him?

Seeing Alexander's face fall, Zoey cleverly changed the topic. "What Lawrence wanted from women's clothes was like that. Although it's gross to say it so bluntly, it's the truth. The truth is always unpleasant."

Zoey continued, "Brian's appearance gave Lawrence other kinds of pleasure. A kind only women can experience."

After saying that, she stopped talking and continued eating.

Alexander, unwilling to give up, asked, "Do you mean Lawrence had sex with all the victims too?"

"Sex? It's called the male gaze, like an invisible snake's tongue, attacking women with a toxic and malicious invisible gaze. This snake's tongue has an invincible shield called, 'I'm just looking, what's wrong?' and a sharp attack knife usually saying, 'You're overthinking it.'"

It was Alexander's first time hearing the term "male gaze."

After Zoey's detailed explanation, he seemed to understand a bit. He said, "You mean, although Lawrence liked women's clothes, he initially had a completely male mindset. So even in a dress, he could only enjoy his perverted thoughts. But after being harassed and violated by Brian, experiencing a woman's crisis firsthand, he began to feel the male gaze, so he dressed more conservatively and lost confidence?"

Zoey praised Alexander, "Not bad, you've learned."

Alexander was silent.

"But," Zoey burped and continued, "since Lawrence isn't really a woman, he can't empathize like a real woman. In a dress, he's Brian's first victim, which is a nightmare he can't escape. But when he takes off the dress, he turns into a perverted murderer, making other women take his place in being repeatedly raped, precisely because he knows how excruciating it is."

"Bastard!" Alexander cursed.

Zoey remained calm. "People can't empathize with each other. For example, Lawrence, after experiencing such a disgraceful past, didn't want to save himself but pushed more people into the abyss. Later, he became Brian's accomplice because he wanted to recover from the humiliation of being raped by Brian and regain his male dignity!"

###chapter 45

Zoey had already made it so clear.

Alexander could also feel Lawrence's perversion, and he chose to become numb in self-preservation.

Whenever the dark side of his heart threatened to consume him, he would seek confidence from the victims.

"Fuck, these bastards!" Alexander gritted his teeth in anger, veins popping on his handsome face.

He wanted to say something but didn't know where to start.

Zoey looked at Alexander's face and felt an urge to comfort him.

Zoey said, "Come on. Not all men in the world are like that. I understand."

Alexander remained silent.

Zoey, having eaten and drunk her fill, tidied up the table a bit and casually said, "Girls who have experienced male gaze often have severe aftereffects. These aftereffects may not necessarily harm their lives, but they will frequently disrupt them."

Alexander seemed to know who she was talking about. He asked, "Ella?"

"Yes, Ella is a typical case. Many girls believe their sixth sense is very accurate, and that's exactly what it is. Ella felt she was being followed and reported it to the police twice, then she successfully saved herself." If Ella hadn't persisted, Zoey didn't dare to imagine what would have happened.

Ella, a young girl, might also end up as a corpse infested with maggots in the sewer.

Zoey said, "Ella's actions were the most correct. Unfortunately, most girls with aftereffects in this society think they are overthinking it. Coupled with the false sense of security given by society, with surveillance cameras everywhere, they hesitate and constantly doubt themselves because there's no evidence."

Alexander heard Zoey's concern for her fellow women and smiled at her. "Ella's greatest happiness in this life was meeting you."

Anyone else wouldn't have chosen to keep watch at Ella's house 24/7.

"I just happened to be free," Zoey responded modestly.

For once, he saw a different emotion on Zoey's face. Alexander couldn't bear to take his eyes off her face.

"What are you two doing here in the middle of the night instead of sleeping?" A familiar voice sounded.

They both looked towards the voice in unison; it was Robert, Dennis, and Charles.

Charles said, "It's almost midnight and the cafeteria is empty. Officer Davis, what should we do?"

Robert glanced at Charles, who was grinning foolishly.

Robert suggested, "Alright, let's go for some barbecue then?"

Charles and Dennis were over the moon. Charles said, "Officer Davis, you're the best. Let's go!"

Alexander thought of the large amount of food Zoey had just eaten and wanted to refuse, but Zoey quickly agreed, "Let's go!"

Alexander was puzzled, could Zoey still eat?

Robert knew Zoey's appetite and looked at her in confusion. "I just saw Tony Fisher, and he was praising your appetite. Didn't you already eat tonight?"

Zoey was about to lie and say Tony had mistaken her for someone else.

Dennis, afraid Zoey would feel embarrassed, quickly yawned and said, "Oh, I'mbit sleepy. I suddenly want to go to bed."

"Me too, even if we go now, I don't think I can eat anything." Charles yawned, completely ignoring Robert's feelings. "Officer Davis, let's eat tomorrow; we've been staying up too late these days."

Robert said, "Whatever you want, we have a day off tomorrow; you can choose tonight or tomorrow night."

"Tomorrow night!" they said in unison.

Zoey knew they didn't want to leave her behind. On the other hand, they were afraid she would overeat. But she was confident in her appetite. To avoid scaring them, Zoey asked, "See you tomorrow night then?"

Robert said, "Alright, it's decided."

It was already early morning, and apart from a few lights at the security post, half of the streetlights outside were off.

They walked together towards the police station entrance.

Charles suddenly spoke, "By the way, Zoey, are you going to the dorm tonight?"

Zoey said, "Yes, but I'm switching dorms tonight. I'm planning to pack up and go back to Riverside Police Department. That way, I can sleep in a bit tomorrow morning."

"You're going back?" Charles suddenly remembered that Zoey was temporarily assigned to assist them from Riverside Police Department.

Now that the case was over, she would definitely return to her original workplace.

Even though he had only known Zoey for a week, he felt a twinge of reluctance. It was a strange feeling.

"Yes, I have to go back." Zoey didn't find it surprising.

The case was over, and she had to leave. It was destined from the start.

Dennis and Charles looked unhappy, while Robert, having experienced this many times, was relatively calm. 

Robert said to Zoey, "I'll drive you back to Riverside Police Department after you pack up as it's on my way."

This time, Zoey agreed. "Thank you, Officer Davis."

She quickly ran towards the dormitory in the criminal investigation department to pack her things, not wanting to keep Robert waiting.

The men watched Zoey's retreating figure, their eyes filled with reluctance.

Charles's nose tingled with emotion and said, "Zoey's retreating figure appeared somewhat sorrowful; she must be reluctant to leave us."

"Come on! Zoey is probably thrilled to leave you," Dennis teased him.

Thinking back to when Zoey worked on the case with them, Charles hadn't been much help, but Zoey and Alexander had worked together seamlessly. The two interns had outshone them.

Robert also slowly withdrew his gaze, making a decision in his heart. "Zoey is so outstanding, so she will definitely come to our department in the future."

The men discussed Zoey's excellence.

Alexander, however, remained much colder than usual.

He had seen how cold and unfeeling Zoey could be. She wouldn't feel reluctant at all when she was about to leave.

Zoey finished packing her things and finally got into Robert's car with a backpack almost as tall as she was.

As soon as she got in, she saw a family photo in Robert's car. Her eyes inadvertently fell on it, and the Robert in the photo looked like a different person.

One was young and handsome; the other had been worn down by time into a middle-aged man.

Before Zoey could look at Robert's son and wife, Robert had already started the engine. "You've had a busy day. Get some sleep and I'll wake you when we arrive."

"Okay." Zoey leaned against the car window and fell asleep unknowingly.

###chapter 46

When she opened her eyes again, she had no idea what time it was.

She instinctively glanced out the car window, and the fatigue on her body not only didn't dissipate but grew even stronger.

As it was already dark outside, Zoey couldn't discern her surroundings.

Robert helped her open the passenger door and led her forward.

"Did the Riverside Police Department dorms move?" Zoey asked with a yawn.

Robert still didn't speak, leading her a few more steps down the hallway.

When Robert unlocked the door, the unfamiliar decor style caught her eye as the light hit her eyes.

Even though she was extremely tired, she could tell that this wasn't the Riverside Police Department where she stayed.

Zoey suddenly felt more awake and heard a woman's voice from inside.

 "Robert, is this the excellent Zoey you told me about?" A gentle-faced woman, Tenley Faye, said with a smile, welcoming Zoey at the door.

Zoey looked at Tenley and recognized her as Robert's wife.

Robert had mentioned bringing her to his home before, but it was delayed due to a case. Unexpectedly, Robert really meant what he said.

Zoey remained silent.

"Robert, what's wrong with her? Is she sleepy or a bit shy?" Tenley gave off a very warm and enthusiastic vibe, making Zoey feel comfortable even though it was their first meeting.

Tenley put her arm around Zoey's shoulder and led her inside.

Given the situation, Zoey greeted, "Hello," then awkwardly looked at Robert. "Officer Davis, this..."

Robert admired Zoey's spirit and intelligence. He knew the police dorms were not conducive to good sleep, especially for their criminal investigation department, which was always bustling.

He looked at Zoey, his eyes showing a rare hint of reluctance. "Didn't I tell you before? My home is much better than the police dorms. You need good sleep quality with such high-intensity work every day. Yes, look at your dark circles. Girls should care more about their face and body than boys."

Faced with the meticulous care and concern from Robert and his wife, Zoey couldn't bear to refuse.

If she insisted on leaving now, Robert would definitely see her off. He wouldn't be at ease until he saw her safe.

'Forget it. I suppose I'll just stay here for one night,' she mused silently.

She met the enthusiastic gaze of Robert and his wife again. Zoey said, "Alright, then I'll trouble you for tonight."

"How can it be trouble? I'm more than happy!" Tenley said, pulling Zoey towards her son's room.

Due to the room's size, they reached Robert's son's room in just a few steps.

During those few steps, Tenley introduced herself to Zoey, keeping the atmosphere lively. "I'm Tenley Faye, you can call me Tenley."

Tenley opened a room and gently led Zoey inside with a smile.

Then Zoey stepped into the small bedroom.

It wasn't big, about 215 square feet. Although it was Robert's son's room, it was cleaner and tidier than some girls' rooms.

It felt very cozy and lived-in at first glance.

Zoey thought about Robert's son, who was in college, and asked hesitantly, "Bedrooms are usually a personal and private space. If I stay here, will your son mind when he finds out?"

After all, they didn't know each other. Some people with OCD were very particular about this.

Tenley quickly waved her hand. "Don't overthink it. My son isn't that fussy. Rest assured, Robert told me you were coming last time, so I changed the sheets to new ones for you. See, pink ones." She spoke in a coaxing tone.

Zoey felt a bit helpless but couldn't show it, because she didn't want to ruin Tenley's good intentions.

"Does he know that I'm staying here? Did you inform him in advance?" Zoey asked anxiously.

"Haha, Zoey, treat our home as your own! Don't worry about my son's thoughts. This house is mine, and I decide who stays. Besides, he hasn't been back for a long time. Your worry is unnecessary. Just relax and stay!"

Although the sheets were changed, Zoey still felt uncomfortable intruding into someone else's private space.

She thought it was just one night, so she decided to stay.

Instead of wasting time discussing this with Tenley, she might as well use the time to rest.

Zoey said, "Alright, thank you, Tenley."

Tenley was thoroughly prepared, even having set out pajamas for Zoey.

When Tenley handed them to her, Zoey was stunned, as the size was one-size-fits-all, just right for her.

It seemed Robert wasn't just being polite; he genuinely wanted her to stay at his home.

"These are all the daily necessities prepared for you. If you need anything else, let me know." Tenley brought a bunch of toiletries and other items for her.

Zoey expressed his gratitude again. "Alright, thank you."

Zoey took them and went to the bathroom to take a shower.

After blow-drying her hair, the scent of the body wash lingered in the air. The fragrance of the body wash Tenley provided was exquisite-not overpowering, but subtle, almost as if it were her natural sce

She usually didn't use such products, fearing they would mask the smell of blood and decay as fragrance could cover up other odors.

Zoey closed the curtains and noticed a book on the desk out of the corner of her eye: "Human Anatomy," "Physiology" series, etc.

Zoey thought, 'Robert's son is studying medicine?'

Curious, Zoey picked up the "Human Anatomy" book. The clean pages had neat, beautiful handwriting in the bottom right corner, clearly written by someone who practiced diligently.

Kelvin Davis. Zoey couldn't help but feel a bit envious seeing Kelvin's name.

How nice. Robert must have named Kelvin with love, hoping he would live freely, unburdened, and full of love.

Although following one's heart was a luxury in this society, it was clear how much Robert loved Kelvin.

Thinking of her original name before she turned eighteen, Zoey's mood visibly worsened.

She put the book back and went to bed.

###chapter 47

Lawrence's case has kept Zoey from having a good night's sleep for a while.

She rarely slept on such a soft bed.

However, she had only been asleep for a short while when she started having a bad dream.

She dreamt of a morning when she was eighteen, walking for hours to the courthouse to submit an application to change her name. Her parents favored sons, and they named her Pat Brown. She disliked the name her parents had chosen for her.

It was a snowy winter day when Zoey stood at the clerk's window and declared with unwavering determination, "I want to change my name!"

The clerk looked at Zoey's frostbitten face and responded, "Follow me."

He led Zoey to the window where name changes were processed and then left.

Zoey confidently pushed her prepared documents towards the window. Before the clerk could ask what she needed, she said directly, "Name change."

The clerk took her documents, glanced at them, and then looked back at Zoey in surprise, saying, "You're the daughter of the Brown Family, right?"

In the dream, Pat took a serious look at the clerk.

Even though she had only seen the clerk once over the years, she still remembered her vividly. She said, "Holly, long time no see."

Holly Shaw, if not for the documents, might not have recognized her on the street.

Holly didn't expect Pat to recognize her so accurately and quickly. "You have a good memory. I didn't expect you to remember me." She smiled and asked casually, "What has your mom been up to lately?"

Pat said, "Nothing much."

Holly glanced around, "Did you come here alone?"

Pat nodded. "Yes."

Holly asked, "A little girl like you walking such a long way-aren't your parents worried about your safety?"

Pat said, "It's fine; I won't die."

Holly fell silent. She thought, 'What happened to Zoey?'

Pat really didn't want to waste any more time and repeated her request, "Holly, I'm here to change my name."

Holly asked, "Changing your name is not a problem, but do your parents know?"

If Holly were not acquainted with Pat's parents, this matter might have been resolved easily. However, Holly did know them and feared incurring their displeasure.

Pat said, "Holly, I'm an adult now. I have the right to change my name. It's allowed by law."

Holly glanced at the date on the ID again. Zoey had just turned eighteen today.

Pat was right; as a service worker, she should fulfill her request.

Holly didn't ask any more questions, opened her case on the computer, and asked, "What name do you want to change to? Have you decided?"

As Holly spoke, she typed Pat's last name, anticipating the name Pat would choose.

Pat said, "Change it to Zoey."

When Pat spoke, Holly's fingers froze on the keyboard.

"What?" She wasn't sure and asked again.

Pat patiently and seriously repeated her name, "Zoey. Is there anything else you're unclear about?"

Holly fell silent.

Seeing Holly stunned, not knowing where to start or what to say, Pat couldn't wait any longer. "Holly, I've made it so clear, and you still don't get it? Or can't you spell the name? How can you work here with such low efficiency?"

It was the first time someone had called Holly inefficient. Pat was still a child, and because of their family connection, she couldn't scold her.

She could only suppress her anger and ask, "Do your parents know you want to change your name?"

Pat didn't respond. Through the dirty window, they couldn't see each other's expressions clearly.

Holly continued to persuade, "I'm a woman too. When I was your age, I was also a girl. I understand your parents prefer boys and know you've had a tough time growing up. But Pat, I have to advise you. Your parents prefer boys, but your brother Derek Brown is innocent. As his sister, you should love and protect him. When your parents pass away, Derek will be the closest person to you in this world."

"If you change your name, aren't you afraid it will create a rift between you and your brother? Tell me, did you have a fight with Derek?"

"You're young and impulsive, but you can't change your name out of anger. You may regret it later. Even though you're legally an adult, you're still a child in our eyes. Don't make a decision you'll regret for the rest of your life. Pat, how about this? I'll call your parents to come and take you home."

Holly spoke in a tone of a well-meaning elder.

Pat took a barely noticeable deep breath, abandoning basic politeness. "Holly, I know you've worked here for for least ten years, right? How can you not know the regulations? The law clearly states that adults can make decisions for themselves! Neither you nor my parents have the right!"

Holly was taken aback. It was the first time her good intentions were met with such hostility.

Pat said with a cold voice, "If you don't help me change my name now, I'll file a complaint against you."

Holly fell silent. If she got a complaint, she'd lose her bonus for the year.

Holly was actually a distant relative of theirs, visiting each other's homes perhaps once a year or even less frequently. She had no means to oppose Pat's decision.

She could only follow Pat's request and change her name to Zoey.

Zoey happily went home.

As soon as she entered, Zoey knew Holly must have told her family about the name change. The atmosphere was tense.

Her parents and grandmother sat on the couch, looking at her with questioning faces. Her grandmother, Fiona Porter, was even wiping away tears, lamenting how much she had spoiled Zoey over the years and how ungrateful she was.

Zoey ignored the tense atmosphere and headed straight to her room.

Goden shouted, "Pat! You have some nerve! Get over here!"

Zoey was not afraid of her father Gordon Brown's anger. She calmly turned around and corrected Gordon's mistake, "My name is not Pat! I've already changed it and my new name is Zoey! Holly should have made it clear to you, right?"

###chapter 48

Zoey looked at Gordon, who was extremely infurious. She calmly said, "Mom and Dad, you need to remember that my new name is Zoey."

She completely ignored Gordon's trembling body and turned to the crying Fiona. "And Grandma, you're old, your hearing isn't good, and your memory isn't great either. I should repeat it a few more times for you, Zoey, Zoey, Zoey."

Fiona clutched her chest, almost fainting from anger. "How did our family end up with such an ungrateful child like you?"

Seeing Fiona almost faint from Zoey's words, Gordon raised his hand and slapped Zoey hard across the face.

She didn't dodge; her eyes were extremely calm. Such an indifferent expression shouldn't appear on an eighteen-year-old girl. But it did.

Gordon, being a man, hit her with such force that Zoey's body swayed, and she stumbled a step forward before quickly regaining her balance.

She didn't cry at all; instead, she looked at Gordon with disdain. "You hit pretty hard. I guess this name really bothers you. I have to go to school this afternoon. If anyone asks why my face is swollen, I'll definitely tell the truth."

Gordon's molars seemed about to shatter, and the veins on his cheeks were visibly bulging. He snarled, "You've grown quite bold, daring to threaten me!"

Zoey said nothing but smiled.

Seeing her smile, Gordon's anger flared up again, and he raised his hand to hit Zoey once more!

Lena Marie stepped forward to stop Gordon. She wasn't speaking up for eighteen-year-old Zoey but was concerned about their own reputation. She said, "Still hitting? Don't you know what Pat is like? I'm the one going to the parent-teacher conference this afternoon, not you. I don't want to explain this to everyone. Enough."

With Lena's persuasion, Gordon finally lowered his hand.

But his gaze at Zoey was still filled with malice and hatred. "If she doesn't change her name back, does she still want to go to school?" He glanced irritably at Lena. "School isn't important. Go, change her name back! Both of you, go together!"

Before Lena could speak, Zoey stepped forward. "No way. I make my own decisions. I won't change it!"

Hearing this, Lena's face turned ugly. "No, we raised you all these years, and you just want to change your name? Is this how you repay your parents?"

"Yes, I am here to repay you. In the eighteen years you raised me, I never ate at the table and enjoyed the rights I should have. I ate your leftovers at every meal. You call me your daughter, but to put it bluntly, my existence is like a pet."

"How can you say that?" Lena couldn't take it anymore and slapped Zoey.

Clearly, Lena's strength was no match for Gordon's; the sound of her slap was noticeably less forceful than before.

Zoey didn't feel much. The previous slap didn't hurt, and this one didn't either.

Lena started to mimic Fiona's act. "How did I raise such a beast?" She cursed while clutching her heart, as if she might faint any second.

Seeing Lena fail, Fiona hobbled over to Zoey with her cane.

She poked Zoey's forehead with her wrinkled hand. "Didn't I say it? A daughter is useless from the moment she's born! She hasn't even married yet and is already defying her parents! If she gets married, won't she cut ties with our family? Though she was young, she actually has such a malicious intention! Gordon, didn't I tell you before? A daughter is not as good as a son! Do you believe me now?"

Zoey looked at the elders who despised her and found it laughable.

If she were younger, she might have broken down and cried because of their words. She had become numb after hearing many similar words.

Zoey looked at her parents and Fiona and genuinely laughed.

"Yes, whatever you say I am, I am. Anyway, I was born inherently flawed. So what?" She then looked at Fiona. "Among the three of you, you're the most right. I'm useless. According to your thinking, my going to school is a waste, right? I should have been serving this family from the moment I could walk and talk, being your servant. But unfortunately, I'm smarter than your grandson Derek. So, you changed your mind and let me go to school because I have a much higher chance of making big money than he does, so I can support Derek in the future, right?"

Zoey continued, "Too bad, you are not smart either. I saw through your plan right away. Since everyone is here today, let me tell you something to crush your hopes. I will never support him in my life! Give up on that idea!"

The hatred and determination in Zoey's eyes were not just words.

They were very serious!

Fiona's blood pressure shot up. "You... you! You're going to drive me to death. Gordon's father, can you come back and see me? She's bullying me too much! I've done everything for the Brown Family; what did I do wrong for God to give me such an ungrateful granddaughter."

Zoey said calmly, "Then let him take you away quickly. I might even pay my respects to you."

Fiona immediately fainted.

"Mom! Mom!"

The house was in chaos.

Gordon and Lena rushed to support Fiona, laying her on the sofa to calm her down.

After Lena took care of Fiona, she went to find Zoey to change her name, but she couldn't find Zoey anywhere in the house.

She checked the time; it was still early for school.

Lena guessed Zoey had left and returned to the sofa to check on Fiona.

Lena asked, "Mom, Pat is gone. How are you feeling now?"

Fiona groaned on the sofa, "Look at the Pat you raised! She actually defied her family and cursed me to die early!"

###chapter 49

"I told you before to arrange accommodation for Pat, but you didn't listen. Pat, a young girl, wandered around all the time andeven changed her name. Who knows, she might even change her last name next!"

Lena sighed several times in a row. "You have no idea how expensive accommodation is. If she stays there, we still have to give her money for food. That money would be better spent on Derek. Pat is already good at studying and she can even tutor Derek for free. I have to work outside every day, and Pat can help with cooking and housework. It's perfect. This way, we could save a substantial amount of money."

Fiona snorted. "If it were for Derek's sake, I should have sewn Pat's mouth shut just now. What nonsense was she spouting? If the neighbors hear it, they'll laugh at our family! I wouldn't dare to go out then!"

Lena said, "Mom, it's my fault. I didn't teach Pat well."

Zoey's stomach growled as soon as she got to school.

She had been busy since morning and hadn't had a bite to eat. But She didn't have any money in her pocket.

Looking at the grand school building, Zoey went straight to the school cafeteria. She bypassed the student cafeteria and went directly to the teacher's cafeteria, skillfully walking to the innermost position.

Several teachers were sitting at a large table.

The female teacher with glasses was her homeroom teacher. Seeing her, she immediately waved at Zoey. "Pat, come here. Why didn't you come to class this morning?"

Zoey walked towards the homeroom teacher, who immediately gave her a seat and noticed the slap mark on her cheek. She asked, "Your face..."

Zoey shook her head indifferently.

Zoey's strong demeanor made the teachers feel even more sorry for her.

"What is your dad thinking? You're so good at studying, and other families would value you so much!" The homeroom teacher was very angry with Zoey's parents. Clearly, this wasn't the first time something like this had happened.

Everyone remained silent, yet all were aware of what had transpired with Zoey.

The male teacher sitting across from her, who was her geography instructor, was so enraged that he lost his appetite.

He put down his utensils。 "This is too much! Hitting a child is illegal. Do your parents even know that?"

The teachers were all very kind to her. One of them immediately noticed Zoey's predicament, saying, "Wait here, I'll get you something good to eat."

Zoey lowered her gaze and said to the concerned teachers, "This time, he didn't hit me for no reason. I went to change my name this morning, and he hit me because of that."

"Your name wasn't that great anyway. Changing it is no big deal. No matter what you change it to, it's no reason to hit you! Hitting is wrong!"

Hearing the teachers all standing by her side, Zoey felt a rare warmth in her heart.

She said, "I changed it to Zoey. From now on, my brother Derek has nothing to do with me."

The teachers looked at each other in silence.

The homeroom teacher took a deep breath. The homeroom teacher said, "We know how much your family dislikes girls, but you can't take it out on Derek."

The geography teacher didn't know how to comfort Zoey. Some things couldn't be changed by words alone. People could never truly empathize with each other.

If he were in Zoey's position, he might not even be as strong as Zoey. Zoey had only changed her name, nothing more.

He didn't judge Zoey's right or wrong based on this but looked at her with pity, saying, "You know the teachers all care about you. Changing your name is a good thing."

At this moment, the teacher who went to get food for Zoey came back.

He placed the food in front of Zoey.

Zoey didn't respond and started eating silently.

The teachers felt a bit heartbroken seeing Zoey like this.

Zoey obediently listened to the teachers' advice.

After eating, Zoey went back to the classroom to take a nap. Someone called out to her, "Pat, someone is looking for you."

Zoey lazily lifted her head and saw the furious Derek outside the door.

She calmly told the classmate who called her, "Don't call me Pat anymore. I changed my name!"

The classmate asked, "What's your new name?"

Suddenly, Derek called out, "Pat!"

She slowly got up from her seat and was immediately dragged to the stairwell by Derek as soon as she stepped out of the classroom!

Derek was about 5.5 feet tall, overweight from childhood, with facial features obscured by fat. He had a hairstyle that made his face look even bigger, making his big head look even larger.

Zoey increasingly couldn't believe they were siblings!

She didn't even want to let her disdainful gaze linger on his face for a second and fiercely shook off Derek's hand.

Because of his weight, Derek's body emitted an unpleasant odor when he got hot.

Especially when he was pulling Zoey, the smell intensified.

Zoey pinched her nose and stepped back, unable to hold back a dry heave.

Derek immediately realized that Zoey was showing disdain for him. Furious, he grabbed Zoey's slender wrist once more. "Pat, you must be out of your mind!"

"Crazy? Oh, then just think I'm crazy." Zoey didn't even bother to look at him, but her hand stayed pinching her nose.

Derek said angrily, "What does your new name mean?"

Zoey sneered. "Since you already know I changed my name, why do you need to confirm it with me?"

Derek really thought she was crazy. "I'm telling you, if you don't change your name back, you don't need to come home anymore!"

"I don't even like going back to that house." Zoey sneered coldly, then looked at him with icy eyes. "If you have any guts, you should change your name too. Don't use such laughable threats to amuse me. It's not like I care about going back to that house. How about this, you go change your name now, and I'll consider you have some guts. Do you dare?"

###chapter 50

Derek's snot was yellow and thick, and he kept sniffling while talking.

Zoey was about to throw up and wanted to leave quickly.

Derek was also infuriated by Zoey's words. Unable to outargue her, Zoey raised her chubby hand!

Zoey watched all this with a cold smile.

Sure enough, children were just like their parents. It was like how inferior genes were always more easily passed down than superior ones.

When her parents hit her, she didn't fight back. First, because of the gratitude for raising her, and second, because she still needed money and had to return to that home. She had to endure even if she didn't want to.

But as for Derek in front of her, Zoey definitely wouldn't show him any kindness!

Zoey swiftly turned to dodge his slap, then quickly used the wall for leverage, stepped on it, and kicked Derek hard in the back.

With a howl of pain, Derek stumbled and fell to the ground due to his clumsiness.

He was in so much pain that tears almost came out, but he still stubbornly said, "Pat, I'm going to kill you today, you lunatic!"

"Sharing the same last name with you is really embarrassing." Zoey had actually intended to leave, but upon hearing Derek's continued bluster, she decided to stay a while longer. She crouched down and stared intently at Derek's current disheveled state.

Her foot stepped directly on his chubby hand but didn't press down. "Derek, if you have the guts, kill me now. Otherwise, as long as I'm alive, you won't have a good time!"

Derek cursed, "Fuck, you lunatic."

Zoey didn't care about Derek cursing her.

She gave Derek a disdainful look, then stood up. Suddenly, she thought of something, squatted down again, and took a phone out of Derek's pocket.

As he attempted to snatch it, Zoey's foot, which had landed in his grasp, suddenly exerted force.

"It hurts." Derek endured the pain and still shouted, "Don't touch my stuff! My grandma just gave that to me! Give it back! If my grandma finds out, she won't let you off!"

"Won't let me off?" Zoey wondered how his parents and Fiona could possibly not let her off.

When she changed her name, didn't she just get slapped twice? Taking the phone would just mean a few more slaps. She didn't care at all.

"Pat! Are you out of your mind!" Seeing that he couldn't get the phone back, Derek started cursing, "Fuck, you'll die a horrible death! You thief, you bitch."

Zoey really wanted to record this scene and play it back for Lena and Gordon.

Their precious son Derek had become this stupid.

"Did you forget that I changed my name? I'm Zoey now, so you'd better remember that with your stupid brain. Repeat it a few times. If you, as my brother, don't know my name, it would rediculous."

Her eyes darkened, and she looked terrifying. "I said it before, as long as I'm alive, you won't have a good time!" After saying that, Zoey got up and threw the phone out the window!

From this height, the phone was definitely done for.

Derek kept staring at Zoey's hand. When she saw that it was indeed empty when she pulled it back, he was even more furious. "Pat! I'm going to kill you! You bitch!"

He hadn't even shown off the phone for a few days, and Zoey had destroyed it. Besides, it was the latest model. He had plans to play games with his classmates! Zoey had ruined everything.

Derek got up in a mess and charged at Zoey, determined to fight her to the death! But at that moment, a voice made him instantly sober up.

"What are you doing?"

Derek turned around and saw that it was the school principal.

As the principal approached, more students gathered to watch.

Derek realized that his loud voice had attracted them. He was stunned, not knowing what to do in this sudden situation.

The principal walked over, recognized them as siblings, and first gave Derek a stern look, then looked at Zoey with a gentle expression. "Pat, what happened?"

Zoey seized the opportunity, her face looking very innocent and aggrieved. "Principal, I found out that my brother Derek brought a phone to school. I know our school doesn't allow phones, so I wanted him to give it to the teachers for safekeeping until after school. But Derek didn't want to and insisted on playing, so I tried to take it from him, and the phone accidentally fell out the window. Derek got even angrier and wanted to hit me."

Seeing Zoey twist the whole situation, Derek unwillingly retorted, "You're lying! That's not what happened!"

Zoey was petite with her aggrieved expression.

The principal knew Zoey was petite and sensed she was aggrieved. He naturally understood the situation and glared at Derek, saying sharply, "You say Pat is lying, so tell me, is the phone downstairs yours?"

Derek nodded. "Yes."

The principal found the flaw and twisted Derek's ear hard. "I've said it more than once in every Monday assembly! Don't bring phones to school; students should be focused on learning. What, don't you understand?"

"Principal, I wasn't playing; she deliberately took my phone and threw it downstairs. She did it on purpose! Principal, you have to help me." Derek was almost in tears.

But the principal didn't listen to his explanation. He poked Derek's forehead angrily. "Everyone in the school can see how Pat behaves! Pat is always the top student in every exam! And you? Can you even get into college?"

Derek was silent. He couldn't clear his name.

"And you, if someone had a sister as excellent as Pat, they'd feel pretty proud. But you? You bring a phone to school, and when Pat tries to correct your attitude, you accuse her of throwing your phone? Derek! It's okay if your grades aren't good; not every kid is born excellent. But your character must be upright! Today, you've really disappointed me. Go, call your parents and have them come over!"

After saying that, the principal turned to Zoey with a completely different attitude and said gently, "Pat, there's still an hour before class. Go take a nap and rest your brain."

###chapter 51

Zoey replied, "Okay, thank you, teacher."

She turned around and gave Derek a triumphant look from a spot where the principal couldn't see.

Derek was nearly driven to madness by Zoey, that contemptible woman, but he didn't dare to act out in front of the principal.

Derek thought, 'Fuck, if Zoey can make it home after school tonight, I'll be impressed!'

The news quickly spread to all the students, and they couldn't help but feel sorry for the phone that fell from the fifth floor.

After the first class ended, a crowd of curious students gathered around Zoey's desk.

"Did you throw that phone?"

The person asking was Vernon Jordan, the idiot who still couldn't solve a single problem even after Zoey had tutored him for over a month.

Zoey nodded. "Yeah."

Vernon asked again, "Derek's phone?"

Zoey replied, "Yeah."

Vernon exclaimed, "Well done! I can totally imagine how cool you looked throwing that phone!"

"Yeah."

Vernon couldn't help but worry, "Won't your parents hit you again when you get home?"

Zoey getting hit was no longer a surprise.

When Zoey was hit for the first time, they were all taken aback. They all thought that a good student must be highly valued at home, but Zoey was good at studying and still got hit.

She didn't know how to answer Vernon's question, so she just looked at him indifferently.

Vernon could tell she didn't want to talk to him. He glanced at her as she was packing her desk, holding a book titled "Practical Self-Defense Techniques." He was a bit surprised, "I know your parents sometimes hit you, but you mustn't fight back; otherwise, even if you excel academically, you won't be able to find a job in the future."

Zoey really wanted to practice her self-defense on him right now.

Zoey asked,  "Can you stop talking?"

Vernon was trying to be nice, but he didn't expect her to still dislike him. He said, "Hey, you never listen to what anyone says. Everyone feels sorry for you and wants to be your friend, but you always act like this, so no one wants to hang out with you."

Zoey said indifferently, "I don't want to be your friend."

Vernon fell silent, feeling a bit sad.

Even though Zoey's words were so blunt, Vernon still didn't want to leave.

A classmate, seeing that Vernon had finished asking, stepped forward and asked Zoey, "Why didn't you come this morning?"

Zoey replied, "I went to change my name."

"Changed your name? To what?"

"Zoey." Zoey was already very familiar with this answer.

Vernon almost jumped out of his seat when he heard that, looking at her with admiration. "Wow! You're really impressive, because you actually dare to change your name."

Zoey was already annoyed with Vernon, and he kept talking. She frowned slightly. "Why are you so surprised?"

"No, I didn't mean anything by it, just curious." Vernon didn't know why, he was a bit afraid of Zoey.

He was always afraid of teachers. Since Zoey tutored him, she was like half a teacher to him.

As long as Zoey glared at him, he would be frightened and immediately behave.

To create a good impression in front of Zoey and to get closer to her, he continued, "We don't have jobs yet, but changing your name is really cool. At least in my heart, you're the most amazing person in the world."

Zoey couldn't stand it anymore and calmly said, "I want to be a police officer."

"Police officer?" Vernon observed Zoey, scrutinizing her for a long time. "But with your build..."

But before Vernon could finish his sentence, Zoey gave him a look, then Vernon immediately stopped, changing his tone, "Well, I think that job suits you perfectly. Yes, being a police officer is great. Police officers only care about ability, not names. Since you're so amazing, those criminals wouldn't see the light of day after meeting you. Don't worry. If the police department doesn't want you, you can come to my house. My mom recently got two dogs that keep running away. Last time, we made a great effort to look for them and finally found them. It's a hassle."

Zoey was exasperated. "Get lost!"

The next day, the alarm clock rang at 7:30 AM, ending Zoey's not-so-great dream.

She slowly opened her eyes and glanced towards the window.

The heavy curtains blocked out most of the sunlight, yet she could still sense that it was already bright outside.

She quickly got ready and left her bedroom with her big bag. As soon as she stepped into the living room, the smell of food hit her taste buds.

It smelt so good. Zoey wanted to leave, but she uncontrollably walked towards the source of the smell.

Tenley noticed someone approaching and saw Zoey waking up out of the corner of her eye. 

Tenley said, "It's only 7:30; why not sleep a bit more? Didn't Robert tell me you have the day off today?"

Zoey explained, "Officer Davis has the day off, but I was transferred to the criminal investigation team to assist with the case. Now that it's over, I have to go back to the police station."

"What? Can't you take a day off? You've been busy for so long." Tenley looked at Zoey with a loving gaze, like a mother looking at her child.

Zoey thought she must miss Kelvin a lot, so sheprojected feelings for Kelvin onto Tenley.

"Yeah, they want me to report back today." Zoey's eyes were fixed on the food in the pot as she spoke.

Tenley gave her a doting look and told her to sit down first. In less than a minute, Teley placed several dishes she had made that morning on the table. "Eat more! Eat until you're full so you'll have energy for work."

Zoey couldn't wait. She took a few bites of the dishes and scooped a spoonful of soup.

Zoey thought, 'After eating cafeteria food for so long, it is rare to have homemade soup. The flavor is rich, and it tastes amazing. So delicious! Robert is really lucky to have a wife like Tenley who can cook so well.'

Tenley watched Zoey eat with such enjoyment, worried she might choke, and quickly said, "Eat slowly, don't rush. When you're almost done, I'll have Robert take you to work. Don't worry."

Zoey said, "No need, Tenley, I can go by myself. The subway is quick and it takes less than half an hour to get to my workplace."

###chapter 52

"Don't be so formal! It's no trouble for Robert to give you a lift. You enjoy your meal, and I'll fetch Robert!" Tenley said with a smile as she turned towards the bedroom to call Robert.

While Tenley was away, Zoey quickly grabbed some more food.

When Tenley was there, she felt a bit embarrassed.

After Tenley's wake-up call, Robert quickly roused himself. By the time he finished getting ready, Zoey had nearly finished her meal.

"Zoey, it's inconvenient for you to carry this big bag around. Leave it here, and I'll bring it to you in the afternoon," Robert said, looking at her bag.

Before Zoey could speak, Tenley snatched Zoey's bag and said, "I think Robert's right; leave it here."

What were this couple up to? Zoey didn't understand at all.

Having just eaten the meal Tenley cooked, she felt embarrassed to take the bag back from her.

Zoey said, "I'll go with what Tenley and Officer Davis said."

Under Tenley's watchful eye, Zoey and Robert left the house and got into Robert's car.

As Robert drove, he casually asked, "Zoey, how's your work at the Riverside Police Department?"

Zoey assumed Robert was just trying to make conversation. Fearing the journey would be too monotonous, he deliberately engaged in conversation.

Zoey said, "It's okay."

Robert asked, "Getting along with your colleagues?"

Zoey said, "It's okay."

Robert fell silent. When she wasn't working on a case, Zoey reverted to her cold demeanor. How was he supposed to bring it up with her being so cold?

Soon, they were approaching the Riverside Police Department.

Zoey knew this route well; it was always terribly congested during workdays.

If Robert insisted on driving her, she might be late and it would waste his time. So she softly said, "Officer Davis, you can drop me off here. It's always jammed ahead at this time; I can walk the rest of the way."

Robert glanced at the traffic ahead; they were at an intersection.

He had the day off, so he didn't mind waiting, but Zoey being late wouldn't be good.

Robert said, "Alright, call me when you get off work; I'll come pick you up."

Zoey expressed her gratitude. "Okay, thank you, Officer Davis."

She hadn't returned to the police station for some time, but upon revisiting the Riverside Police Department, she was unexpectedly overwhelmed with a sense of familiarity and nostalgia. Maybe it was because the high-intensity work in the criminal investigation department contrasted perfectly with the calm here.

Back at her desk, she did a quick disinfecting.

The Riverside Police Department was always quite relaxed, with almost nothing to do.

After tidying up, she opened her laptop, thinking of updating her novel.

Just as she started typing, a face popped up beside her laptop. Emma had come over to her desk and took a look, asking, "You're back? Did you catch the killer? So quickly?"

Zoey glanced at her. "Yes."

While Emma was having dinner in the cafeteria last night, she intermittently overheard others mentioning that Zoey had discovered new clues in the stalking case, successfully solved a series of serial murders, and restored peace to the entire city. It was a major case in criminal investigations.

Emma was consumed with jealousy, as she had always considered Zoey the most idle member of the Riverside Police Department, assigned only to trivial cases. She didn't expect that this case would turn out to be a series of serial murders.

Zoey had stolen all the limelight. If Zoey got a permanent position, it would be a done deal. Zoey might even get a permanent position faster than her. Why? How did such a good thing happen to her! Emma was almost driven crazy by this.

Emma felt an overwhelming urge to strangle Zoey, and her smile was a bit forced.

Zoey had long seen through her little schemes.

But Emma liked to keep up the act. "Can you tell me about the process? The suspect was so cunning; how did you catch him?"

Zoey only wanted to update her novel and didn't want to bother with her now.

But seeing the eager look in Emma's eyes, she decided to tease her, "I just followed the clues and found him."

Emma was silent.

She didn't get the answer she wanted and was infurious. Zoey was doing this on purpose, right?

Emma was quite tempted to confront Zoey, but the thought of the neighboring table's astonishment when discussing the matter intrigued her even more.

As a fellow intern, she hadn't even seen a dead body yet; while Zoey had already solved a case.

Could Emma feel balanced? Knowing Zoey was like this, she continued to ask, "Can you tell me in detail? Everyone's talking about it like it's a miracle. I heard it was dismemberment? How did you find the body parts?"

Zoey hated trouble. Emma was now a 'trouble.'

Her side gig as an online novelist earned her at least two thousand dollars a month. If Emma kept talking, she might not make that money if she had work in the afternoon.

If she had work in the afternoon, she wouldn't be able to update. Then she wouldn't have money today.

Zoey looked at the empty word count on her laptop, then at Emma's eager face.

Zoey said, "Sure, I can tell you everything you want to know. As detailed as you want."

"Really? That's great. Thanks, Zoey." Emma pulled up a chair, ready to listen.

Zoey's expression turned cold. "But you have to pay me."

Emma's smile froze, blinking, not understanding what she meant.

Emma was confused and asked,  "I have to pay to hear a story? Or is it confidential? Are you afraid I'll leak it? Don't worry, I won't."

Zoey remained unmoved and stared at her.

"You misunderstood me," she explained. "The story you want to hear cost me several sleepless nights and a lot of effort with my colleagues. You think you can just listen for free? Am I that idle?"

Emma thought she was joking at first, but Zoey didn't seem to be.

"We're colleagues and schoolmates, right? You don't have to be like this..." she started to say.

Zoey cut her off, "Stop with the nonsense; pay up if you want to hear."

Emma was silent. She hated Zoey but she really wanted to hear the story.

She asked Zoey, "How much?"

Zoey replied, "Two hundred and fifty dollars."

Emma was furious but helpless as she remained silent.

As she hesitated between getting angry and not, Zoey had already taken out her phone.

She opened the payment app and held it out to her. The amount was exactly two hundred and fifty dollars.

###chapter 53

Emma knew Zoey well. Although she was annoyed, she still paid the money.

Two hundred and fifty dollars were transferred to Zoey's account.

Zoey received the money and her mood improved significantly. She went from a cold attitude to vividly describing the case to Emma, with clear logic that made it feel like Emma were there. She even described many details.

Emma felt that the two hundred and fifty dollars were well spent.

At the most critical moment, Zoey wanted to drink some water, and Emma kept her eyes fixed on her.

As Zoey drank water, urged her to hurry up.

Until the entire case process was fully explained, including how they discovered there were two killers, how they found the dismembered body parts underground, and how Lawrence insisted on taking the blame... Emma was dumbfounded, as if she were in a detective movie.

Emma remarked, "No wonder so many people want to join the criminal investigation department. This is so different from the small things we handle every day. You have to outsmart criminals every day."

Zoey said, "Pretty much."

Emma still felt a bit unsatisfied and wanted to ask more details, like what the human flesh looked like after being dismembered, and how it compared to regular pork.

Various questions floated in her mind, and she was about to ask when another intern, Zack Watson intervened. He the two of them together and thought there was some new announcement from the police department, so he asked, "What are you talking about? Is there something going on?"

Emma glanced at him, "Discussing a case."

"A case?" Intern Zack got interested and sat down, asking, "What case? I want to hear it too."

Emma thought about the two hundred and fifty dollars she spent and looked at Zack. She said to Zack, "Pay two hundred and fifty dollars for the case analysis fee."

"Why do I have to pay to hear about a case? Are you kidding me?" Zack's eyes were clear, thinking she was joking.

Seeing his expression, Emma looked at him seriously. "Really, it's a fresh big case, a serial killer dismemberment case!"

Hearing about the serial killer dismemberment case, Zack suddenly remembered that someone from their police department was assisting with the case.

He was curious about it too, because this was happening around him.

"You know?" Zack asked again to confirm.

Emma nodded, "Of course, I just heard it. If you want to hear it, scan the code."

Zack realized it was Zoey who told her and looked at Zoey warmly, asking, "Zoey, can you tell me?"

"I'm a bit tired." She said while yawning.

Seeing Zoey wanting to sleep, Zack had to negotiate with Emma again, "It's not the latest from you; give me a discount and let me listen."

Emma knew her storytelling wasn't as good as Zoey's, so she pretended to be in a difficult position, "Considering we're colleagues, I'll give you a 20% discount, so give me one hundred and eighty-eight dollars."

"One hundred and eighty-eight dollars?" Zack was first surprised, then laughed, "I might as well wait for Zoey to tell me the original version when she feels like it."

Emma was silent, feeling annoyed. Her aversion to Zoey was steadily intensifying.

But she didn't want to miss out on Zack as a customer. Emma said, "Then you say, how much."

Zack said, "Eighty-eight dollars."

Emma had no choice but to agree, "Fine, scan the code."

Zack happily scanned the code, and eighty-eight dollars were transferred to Emma's account.

As Emma was reflecting on the $250 she had transferred to Zoey, a lucrative idea suddenly crossed her mind.

Eighty-eight dollars per person, if she told three people, wouldn't her two hundred and fifty dollars be recovered?

Just as she was calculating in her mind, a familiar payment code interface appeared in front of Emma again.

She followed the phone to find its owner, and it was Zoey.

Zoey said, "Transfer twenty dollars to me."

Emma looked at her puzzled. "Why? Didn't I just pay you in full?"

Zoey explained, "Copyright fee."

Emma was silent and had to transfer another twenty dollars.

Emma was helpless and had to transfer it.

Zoey made two hundred and seventy dollars in an hour and was in a good mood. She put on her headphones and left the rest of the storytelling to Emma. She casually found some soothing music and started writing her novel.

She hadn't asked her family for money since she was eighteen.

Actually, she did ask, but her family didn't give her any more.

Zoey's daily expenses were all earned by herself through work-study programs. Her parents' excuse was that they knew she had the ability.

But Zoey knew that it wasn't that her parents didn't have money to give her, but that they believed spending money on a girl like her was a waste.

Their money could only be spent on Derek, even if he wasted a few hundred dollars, they wouldn't mind. This was her parents' deeply ingrained gender bias.

Thinking about the past, Zoey's face darkened.

The fact that she was still alive meant she indeed had the ability to survive in society!

Soon it was noon; Zoey had just finished eating and wanted to go back to the dorm to sleep for a while. As she walked out of the police station, she saw her teacher John pulling two people apart. She was about to turn around and leave.

Unexpectedly, John had good eyesight and saw her immediately.

John said, "Zoey, come here!"

Zoey took a barely noticeable deep breath in frustration.

She tried to slow her steps, but still reached the door in a few steps.

In front of her, besides her and John, there was a middle-aged man and a woman.

The woman curled up on the ground, unable to evade the brutal beating from the middle-aged man.

"Bitch, can't you stay still for a day? I'm busy as hell outside, and you're out here messing around with other men? Fuck, I'm going to kill you today!"

Zoey hadn't had a chance to see the woman's face clearly, but she could roughly understand what was going on from the man's shouting.

They were right at the police station entrance; as apolice officer, She had to stop him.

After pulling the middle-aged man away from the woman, she bent down to check on the woman who was clutching her stomach. Her face was pale.

Seeing Zoey trying to help her up, she looked at Zoey's hand but had no strength to take it.

"Are you okay?" The woman's hair appeared somewhat greasy, indicating it had likely been two or three days since she last washed it. Combined with the cold sweat from the beating, which clung to her disheveled strands, she looked utterly disheveled..

It was clear she had been enduring her pain. The woman said, "No, I'm fine."

Zoey noticed she was holding her abdomen tightly and asked, "Is your stomach injured?"

The woman didn't speak.

Seeing Zoey comforting the woman, the middle-aged man started cursing again, "Do not let her frail appearance evoke your sympathy; she is nothing but a wretch, utterly undeserving of anyone's pity!"

###chapter 54

He spoke while getting even angrier.

Ignoring whether there were any police around, he rushed up and tried to hit the woman again.

John immediately grabbed him. "If you keep hitting her, she'll die! This is the police station entrance! Committing a crime here, are you really in such a hurry to get caught?"

After John said this, the man stopped his actions but still glared viciously at the woman.

Seeing the man calm down, John checked on the woman's injuries. "Ms. Moore, do you need me to take you to the hospital?"

Ruby Moore seized the opportunity and forced a bitter smile, her eyes filled with tears, looking very pitiful. She said, "Mr. Williams, I'm fine. I came here today to ask for your help in seeking justice."

John gave Zoey a look. Then Zoey walked towards Ruby, intending to help her up.

John said, "Alright, don't worry; let's go inside and talk."

Ruby rested for a moment before getting up from the ground.

She didn't need Zoey's help and carefully got up on her own. She even gave Zoey a grateful look.

Zoey stood to the side and called out to John, "Mr. Williams, should I go get Emma?"

"Why call her? You can handle it." John's gaze deepened as he looked at Zoey.

Zoey was speechless.

She had been feeling quite tired lately and wanted to take advantage of the downtime to rest more.

Zoey thought, 'No matter how smart a person is, they can't handle being used like this!'

Moreover, she really hated these domestic dispute cases. These people had such twisted thoughts that no amount of persuasion would help.

Not to mention the cases at the police station.

Take the village she grew up in, for example, where ninety-nine percent of the women had the same mindset.

They were already married, so for the sake of the children, they would endure. Some people even endured for a lifetime.

As Zoey looked at Ruby's bitter face, she felt that listening to her complaints would be a waste of her lunch break, and she'd rather take a nap.

She glanced at John. "Mr. Williams, I'm not in a good state right now."

John intantly realized that Zoey was in a bad mood and she may curse people.

Thinking about the things Zoey had done since she started her internship, he decided to compromise, "Alright, go get Emma and then take your lunch break."

Zoey nodded. "Okay."

Zoey returned to the office and woke up Emma, who was on her lunch break. "Mr. Williams is looking for you."

Then she went back to her dorm, wrote a ###chapter of her novel, and took a nap since she had enough time.

It was almost the end of the workday when Emma finally returned.

Seeing Emma's face full of resentment, Zoey could already guess the reason.

It was indeed as she had expected.

Emma angrily sat at her desk, irritably throwing her pencil case to the ground. "I'm so pissed off!" The more she thought about it, the angrier she got, and she suddenly stood up from her seat.

She walked over to Zoey and questioned her, "Zoey, did you do this on purpose? Why did you call me for such a crappy case? Why didn't you go yourself?"

Zoey put away her phone and glanced at her calmly. "This is an opportunity to show your abilities in front of Mr. Williams and it could affect your future promotion. Shouldn't you be thanking me?"

Emma fell silent.

Zoey's words extinguished all the anger Emma wanted to vent on her.

She was right. Zoey had already handled such big cases. If she kept being mediocre, wouldn't Zoey get promoted before her?

Thinking about this, Emma restrained her temper.

Thinking about that frustrating case, the more she kept it inside, the more annoyed she felt. She grabbed a chair from the side and sat next to Zoey, starting to complain, "Zoey, let me tell you how messed up that couple is..."

Zoey could already guess the gist without her saying it.

She interrupted Emma disdainfully, "I don't want to hear it."

Emma said, "No way! You have to listen!"

Zoey simply covered her ears.

Emma, determined to get her point across, pulled Zoey's hands away from her ears.

Emma said, "You talked so much this morning, and I listened quietly without interrupting you! Why don't you treat me the same way. "

Thinking about the morning, Zoey suddenly thought of another money-making opportunity.

Noting Emma's resolute intent to sour her mood, she gazed serenely at her and said, "Very well, if you wish for my attention, then pay me and I shall heed."

"Pay you?" Emma got even angrier. "Didn't I pay you this morning? I want you to listen to my frustrations, and now you still want money?"

Zoey explained indifferently, "This morning, you needed to listen, so you paid. Now you need to vent, so you should pay. Whoever has the need should pay."

Emma fell silent. It kind of made sense.

She asked, "How much?"

Zoey replied, "One hundred dollars."

Emma transferred the money quickly, without even bargaining with Zoey.

From the speed of the transfer, it was clear how much that couple had tormented Emma.

Zoey happily looked at her balance, which had increased by another hundred dollars, and felt great. "Go ahead."

"Do you realize how depraved this man is? He doesn't just assault his wife Ruby's chest; he targets her lower body as well. As if having mistresses and gambling weren't enough, he even vents his frustrations on Ruby when he comes home. But the most infuriating part is that all his violent tendencies occur right in front of their children!

The more Emma talked, the angrier she got. She glanced around the office, saw that John wasn't there, and whispered to Zoey, "And I really don't understand what Mr. Williams is thinking. Ruby wants a divorce, and she came to the police station for that, but Mr. Williams told her not to divorce and to give her husband another chance! Fuck, my worldview is really shattered. How can  Mr. Williams said those words?"

This society was very forgiving to everyone, even if she divorced. She could take care of the child on her own by finding a job!

"If her husband didn't have this gambling problem, I could understand Mr. Williams' stance, but this man doesn't do a single good thing! I wanted to persuade her to divorce, but Mr. Williams stopped me. It pissed me off!" Emma couldn't understand John's actions and added, "Ruby gets beaten every day. Do you know why she came to report this time? It will make you furious if you know it!"

"The reason is that she hopes the police can intervene and make her husband write a guarantee not to hit her in front of the child! Fuck!" Emma was speechless as she told Zoey about it, "You know, as a modern woman, I don't want her to sacrifice herself for anyone anymore. I even pulled her aside and persuaded her for a long time. I don't know if she listened, but after I said a lot, she just told me about her child.

###chapter 55

Zoey suddenly interjected, "Did she say that the child is still young and can't be without a father?"

Emma asked, "How do you know?"

Compared to Emma's agitation, Zoey seemed very calm. "It's very common. This is just foolish thinking. In 2022, the domestic violence rate in Veridian was as high as 35.7%, which means that out of every ten couples, three have domestic violence issues. Ninety percent of those who don't get divorced stay together because the children are still young."

Emma had no idea where she got this data from. "Really? I don't see many cases around me."

Zoey looked at her like she was an idiot. "Because you live in the city! If you grew up in a more rural area, you would know. These things are common. The first time a woman gets beaten, she might think about divorce, but the moment she sees her child or her husband sincerely apologizes afterward, she softens and forgives him."

She continued, "Almost every time, they convince themselves in this cyclical way. After repeating it so many times, they become numb and start to accept it, thinking this is the marriage God gave them, and they have to accept it. In reality, they just lack courage. And even if someone is being abused, do you think they would tell you? Those who don't want a divorce always hide it. Who would share their misfortune with you? Those who truly understand and want a divorce, you'll find out they've been abused for years, almost beaten to death, and can't take it anymore before they finally get divorced."

For the first time, Emma felt like she and Zoey lived in different worlds.

Emma asked, "Why can't they just leave decisively the first time they are unlawfully harmed? Why wait until they are almost beaten to death?"

Zoey didn't want to bother with Emma, this fool, but remembering the hundred dollars she received, she patiently gave her a lesson. "Isn't it because they're stupid? They believe a man will change for them. Abusive men take advantage of their weakness and inability to leave, so they escalate. You haven't seen those women who are almost beaten to death, still begging their husbands not to leave them. Do you know why their husbands beat them?"

Emma was full of confusion. "Why?"

Zoey replied, "Because their husbands fell in love with someone else and forced them to divorce."

Emma was silent, because she couldn't understand it completely. She said, "I used to think our country's laws were really biased towards women, but now it seems that sometimes it's not that the law can't protect them, it's that they are willing!"

"There's nothing we can do," Zoey said.

Indeed, most of them were willing. They thought how hard their life was, and they endured it all for the sake of their children. Some of them even thought that the person trying to persuade them was the one with the problem, rather than considering that they might have been at fault themselves.

Emma took a deep breath. "Isn't there any way to save them?"

"Save them? The country's laws have always been trying to save them!" Zoey pursed her lips. "When we encounter such situations, we just respect their choice and hope they stay together forever, so those bad guys don't harm other women."

Emma was very disdainful of Zoey's indifferent attitude. "We are cops! How can you say such cold words?"

Emma really couldn't understand why Zoey could be so calm.

She was so agitated that her voice was much louder than before, causing many people in the office to look in their direction instinctively.

"Zoey, I thought Mr. Williams was a man, so he would side with men, but we are both women. We need to make these ignorant women realize the importance of the situation, don't we?"

Before she could finish her words, a slap landed on Emma's face.

Emma was stunned for a while before she reacted.

Zoey didn't show any sign of apology. "Calm down, can't you see you're disturbing others' work?"

Emma was silent.

She wanted to get angry, but seeing the eyes of the people around her, she realized she was indeed disturbing others' work.

The hand she wanted to raise was put down again.

The slap from Zoey wasn't very painful, so she probably didn't mean anything else.

Seeing that she finally quieted down, Zoey said softly, "I haven't finished speaking, why are you in such a hurry?"

"Then go ahead."

"Next is the paid knowledge content." Zoey smiled at her. "Whether you listen or not is completely voluntary."

Emma was a bit impulsive. Maybe the previous $250 made her feel it was worth it. She said without hesitation, "Just say it, how much."

"Since you're a repeat customer, I'll give you a 50% discount, $100."

Emma didn't hesitate and transferred $100.

Zoey, seeing her balance increase by another $100, began to explain to Emma with satisfaction. "Actually, it's very simple. When you take on such cases, you need to have your own judgment. First, listen to what their relationship is really about and why the woman is being beaten. If the man has a temper problem but no other bad habits, and the woman has forgiven him several times, and she tells you that he's very good to her when he's not having an episode, you don't need to listen to her follow-up. Stand on the woman's side and advise her to divorce. Usually, after leaving the police station, the two will reconcile."

"If the woman is beaten because of infidelity, I think this is very simple to handle, and you don't need me to teach you. If a couple has always had a good relationship and suddenly fights, and the man pushes the woman, and she wants a divorce, just stay away. Eighty percent of the time, the woman won't divorce; she's just spoiled and can't stand grievances."

"Of course, there's another kind, like the case you encountered today. If you sincerely advise them, and they really get divorced, the man might think you ruined his family and might even retaliate against you. He will never think he's wrong. Ms. Moore's husband today is a typical example."

"Just follow the procedure, both parties need to make a statement. After that, issue a domestic violence warning. If there are injuries, issue a medical examination form. If the injuries are serious, he can be detained and imprisoned."

"But usually, it's useless. If they have children, they will consider that a criminal record for the man will be bad for the child's future. But we have to be responsible, and some procedures must be followed even if we don't want to. When she wants to leave, just tell her that if she can endure it this time, don't call the cop next time."

Emma thought she heard wrong. "What?"

###chapter 56

"Don't you think it's a waste of police resources? What they really need is a psychologist, not us." Zoey looked at Emma's surprised expression and continued, "Isn't our time valuable too? I'd rather spend a few hours watching a feel-good TV show than waste it on such foolish people."

"I especially hate it when stupid people say, 'When he hits me, it means he doesn't love me; when he doesn't hit me, it means he loves me.' They just can't break out of that vicious cycle."

"Men and women are fundamentally different creatures. Women will never be as strong as men. Once he starts hitting you, where's the love in that? But they just don't get this simple truth."

Emma seemed to understand a bit more after Zoey's explanation and sighed.

It seemed to be a sigh of pity and regret for such women.

Zoey added, "Of course, there's another situation where the woman really wants a divorce, but every time she calls the cop, they just mediate and send them back home. In such cases, you must tell her not to report domestic violence but to report being assaulted!"

Emma asked, "What's the difference?"

"Domestic violence is considered a family dispute, and the man might not even be detained. By the time he gets out of the police station, the woman might be severely beaten. Reporting an assault gets the man detained, giving the woman time to prepare for a safe divorce."

"Well..." Emma, who went to the same university as Zoey, suddenly felt like Zoey was more like her mentor.

She suddenly felt that the hundred dollars she spent was worth it!

"And one more thing," Zoey reminded, "If she's seriously injured, make sure she goes to the hospital to get a medical examination and keep the records. These are essential, and the most important thing, don't forget!"

"What's it?"

"Some people don't want to report their husbands because of their children. If the parents have a criminal record, it could affect the children. Most men who commit domestic violence don't get punished because of this."

"Really? What a strange rule," Emma found it absurd. "If the mother reports the father for hitting her and he gets sentenced, it affects the children. The kids are really unlucky."

"Unlucky?" Zoey couldn't believe Emma had been in police school for three years.

She asked, "Why would you think the kids are unlucky? Don't you remember the cases our teachers showed us in school? Many criminals commit crimes because of a bad family environment, which twists their minds. The family environment indeed has a significant impact on a child's growth, and no one can deny that."

"When children are still young and in a state of ignorance, they are indeed pitiable. However, as time goes by, they may be influenced by unhealthy family relationships and learn their father's violent behavior, which could lead to them having violent tendencies towards their wives or even strangers in the future."

Emma seemed to have an epiphany and thought for a moment. Zoey's analysis of domestic violence cases was thorough, and she couldn't deny it.

But in some ways, Zoey seemed a bit too cold. She commented others' fates after doing what she could and helped the victims make up their minds to escape their suffering, regardless of the children's fate.

A strange feeling lingered in Emma's heart.

She couldn't fully agree with Zoey, nor could she completely disagree with her.

Zoey, acting as if nothing had happened, took a bag of milk from the drawer and started drinking it.

Emma just watched her, and the two fell into a dead silence.

Zoey wanted to write more of her novel while she wasn't busy. Just as she opened the webpage, she suddenly thought of something and turned to ask, "How did you handle Ms. Moore's case in the end?"

"What else could we do? We mediated a bit, the man insincerely apologized, promised not to hit her in front of the kids, and they left." Thinking back to the incident, Emma's face was filled with frustration.

Even after hearing so much from Zoey, she still couldn't understand.

"What about the warning notice?" Zoey asked.

"Mr. Williams told them to wait for it, but they said they had to pick up their kids from school and left."

Zoey wasn't surprised at all; it was exactly as she expected. "Next time they come, don't do anything. Don't even talk to Ms. Moore. Domestic violence cases are common, and Mr. Williams is more experienced than both of us."

Emma's feedback was enough to show that John indeed had more experience.

Emma tried to mediate, but John told her not to bother.

It showed that John had tried to mediate before, but after doing it so many times without success, he became numb to it.

So he simply stopped trying and told them to live their lives.

"Oh," Emma responded, thinking about Ruby being beaten, and sighed again. "I hope Ms. Moore doesn't get beaten again. Do you think if she had discovered her husband's violence before having kids, the outcome would be different?"

Zoey was about to put on her headphones, already having one earbud in.

Suddenly, Emma's question made her laugh.

"Why are you laughing?" Emma was puzzled.

"Many families with domestic violence have a second child," Zoey said.

"Really? Fuck, they get beaten and still keep having kids?" Emma was shocked; it was beyond her imagination.

"What do you think?" Zoey gave her a meaningful look that said, "Haven't I told you many times? They're stupid. They go from being conflicted to getting used to it, and eventually, they start wondering if it's their fault. They deeply believe that maybe if they had children, things would be different. They voluntarily have a second child with their abusive husbands, hoping that having more children will make their lives better."

Emma was silent, thinking it was truly absurd.

She was speechless. "According to you, they kind of 'deserve' it!"

That was exactly what Zoey thought, but she didn't say it.

John walked in at that moment, seeing Emma and Zoey chatting so closely, and gave them a surprised look. "Chatting? Since when did you two get so close?"

Emma felt a bit awkward at John's comment.

She instinctively wanted to move away from Zoey.

But Zoey calmly replied, "Mr. Williams, your judgment is wrong. We just have a financial relationship, nothing more."

###chapter 57

Emma remained silent; Zoey was still as annoying as ever.

John glanced at the two of them and smiled subtly, then asked, "Who's coming with me on patrol tonight?"

Zoey immediately sensed trouble and quickly said, "I have an appointment with Officer Davis tonight. I need to wrap up that case over there."

John nodded at her response, "Alright, you handle your business." Then he looked at Emma, "Remember to get ready."

Emma hadn't even said a word yet, and now she was suddenly forced to work overtime.

Feeling annoyed, she glared at Zoey resentfully and returned to her workstation.

Zoey was really lucky, using the case to escape patrol duty. Poor Emma, she wouldn't be able to get her beauty sleep tonight.

When it was time to get off work, Zoey left right on time.

Emma's gaze was like daggers, sweeping over her constantly! But Zoey pretended not to see it, packed her things, and left the police station.

Robert had arranged to meet her at the place where he had dropped her off.

Zoey walked through the crowd and immediately spotted Robert's private car.

Robert was curled up in the driver's seat, sleeping. In their line of work, they often had to switch between day and night shifts, so they slept whenever they could. It had become a habit for everyone in the criminal investigation department.

Hearing the car door open, he woke up instantly.

Yawning, Robert glanced at Zoey as she got in the car, started the engine, and asked with concern, "How was your day at the police station?"

Thinking about earning Emma's money, Zoey felt a bit smug as she answered, "Same as usual."

"You seem pretty happy. Is it because our criminal investigation department's workload is too high, and you feel relaxed when you come back?"

Zoey knew Robert misunderstood her, but she didn't explain further and simply replied, "No."

"That's good. You should know hard work leads to progress!" Robert looked at her seriously, then smiled, clearly teasing her.

But Zoey remained expressionless, always giving off a cold vibe.

This made Robert feel a bit awkward, but since it was just the two of them in the car, he didn't mind too much. After all, he genuinely liked Zoey.

"Let's go, I'll take you out for some beef tonight!"

"Okay." Zoey loved eating beef.

But she didn't expect Robert to take her to a restaurant for beef; she thought they were going to his house for Tenley's cooking.

Robert took her to a well-known restaurant in the city, and from a distance, they could see Alexander and the others already waiting.

Their conversations often revolved around corpses and case details, which could make other diners uncomfortable.

To speak more freely, they had booked a private room.

Charles was thrilled to see Robert bring Zoey along, "Zoey! Officer Davis said you were still working today."

"Yeah." Although she had returned from the criminal investigation department, she still had to work at the police station until her day off, which was at least four days away.

Robert and Dennis sat further inside, leaving the seat by the door for Zoey, who sat down next to Alexander.

Alexander smiled and said, "We've already ordered some dishes. Take a look and see if there's anything else you want."

He handed the menu to Zoey like a gentleman.

Zoey took it but didn't look at it.

She replied indifferently, "I'm not picky."

Everyone at the table knew about Zoey's appetite, and the atmosphere became tense for a second. Dennis broke the awkwardness first, "What do you usually do at the police station?"

"Not much, just mediating some civil disputes. The cases aren't complicated, just a bit time-consuming."

Alexander added, "Isn't that completely unrelated to your expertise? I remember you being quite good at creating disputes." He smirked and took a sip of water.

His words made Zoey dislike him even more. "Yeah, Mr. Williams never takes me on patrols. I just idle around at the police station and leave when it's time. It's quite nice."

This statement drew a lot of 'envy' from the others.

In the criminal investigation team, leaving on time was a luxury; they felt lucky if they didn't have to pull an all-nighter.

Seeing everyone looking at Zoey with envy, Robert cleared his throat, trying to change the subject.

He wasn't just treating everyone to dinner to reward them; he had other plans. "Hasn't it been half an hour since we ordered? Why hasn't any dish arrived yet? I'm starving."

Dennis went out to check, and within a few minutes, various dishes were brought in.

Robert started eating first, and the others followed.

Zoey was the one enjoying the food the most.

Robert watched everyone chatting and laughing, but his eyes were always on Zoey's every move.

When she seemed about four or five bites away from being full, he casually asked, "Zoey, you've been with our team for a while now. How do you find the work environment here?"

"It's good." Except for Alexander who was a bit annoying, the others were tolerable.

"Right, I also think our team's atmosphere is great. But we're a bit short-handed. Sometimes, we men can't come up with everything, mainly because we lack a meticulous girl."

After saying this, Robert stopped eating to show his sincerity, waiting for Zoey's response.

Zoey continued eating, responding casually and perfunctorily.

Robert was puzzled. Was he not being clear enough?

Robert was getting anxious, but Zoey kept eating.

Dennis couldn't stand it anymore, "Zoey, stop eating for a moment. You're driving Officer Davis crazy!" He glanced at Robert, feeling speechless, "Officer Davis, if you have something to say, just say it directly!"

He turned to Zoey and explained Robert's intention straightforwardly, "Officer Davis hopes you can join the criminal investigation team. If you agree, he'll apply to transfer you immediately. How about it?"

Zoey's expression remained indifferent, and no one knew what she was thinking.

She kept eating.

Seeing this, Alexander added, "I think it's a good idea. Zoey's personality suits our team better than mediating disputes."

Charles also cautiously observed Zoey's expression, "Our work isn't as easy as the police station, and we face brutal criminals every day, with the risk of encountering extremists, it could be life-threatening."

###chapter 58

Before he could finish his sentence, Dennis shot him a look and said, "Shut up, will you!"

If he kept talking, Zoey would be scared off, let alone agree.

Zoey slowly chewed and swallowed the beef in her mouth, looking relaxed and casual. "I'm fine with it. I can work anywhere." As long as she could earn money, it was the same for her to work anywhere.

Alexander glanced at Zoey and then turned to Robert. "Zoey agrees it."

Robert's expectant look turned into joy. "Great, I really like this answer. Zoey, you can stay at my place. Tenley likes you a lot. You won't have to pay for food or lodging, and you can enjoy Tenley's cooking every day. We can go to work together."

Zoey felt this arrangement would leave her with no personal space.

Although she missed Tenley's cooking, being together every day seemed unnecessary.

She politely declined, "Officer Davis, there's no need for that. The dorms at the criminal investigation department are similar to school dorms, and I'm used to it. Staying at your place all the time isn't right, and it would affect your private time with your wife."

But Robert was insistent. "Stay! I know the conditions of the dorms in the criminal investigation department. As a captain, I know how important good sleep is for detectives. Only with good sleep can we outsmart criminals and predict their next move! Besides, I have been old, so there is no need to spend the romantic private time with my wife."

"But..." Zoye wanted to say something more.

"That's settled."

Alexander, knowing Zoey well, mediated, "Officer Davis, you might scare Zoey away with this. How about you rent the room to her? That way, Zoey would feel more comfortable staying. Otherwise, anyone would feel awkward staying for free."

Robert thought Alexander had a point and realized he hadn't considered it thoroughly.

After thinking for a moment, he said, "Alright, how about this: $300 a month, no need to worry about utilities, free breakfast, and late-night snacks. Don't think it's too cheap. If you're home resting, just accompany Tenley shopping and chatting. How about it?"

Hearing that, Zoey suddenly thought of the $450 she earned today.

Robert had made it clear, and not accepting seemed disrespectful.

"Thank you, Officer Davis. I'll stay for now."

"No need to be polite!" Robert was overjoyed to have Zoey stay at his place.

Zoey suddenly thought of Robert's son, Kelvin, who was away at college, and asked, "Officer Davis, does your son know you're renting out his room?"

Robert looked puzzled. "What son?"

Zoey fell silent, thinking, 'He forgets his own son, Kelvin?'

Alexander was also curious about Robert's son, Kelvin, who was away at college. "Officer Davis, how old is Kelvin? This is the first time I've heard about him during my internship."

"He's a senior in college, studying medicine. He's probably interning now." Robert looked a bit helpless when thinking about Kelvin. "Kelvin was obedient when he was young, but as he grew up, he became very independent. He chose his college major without discussing it with me or Tenley. Before we could ask, he had already filled out the application."

"Officer Davis, what did you want him to study?" Dennis asked curiously.

Robert casually took a bite of food. "I don't know. I don't even know what he likes."

Everyone exchanged glances, feeling speechless.

But they had to admit, the celebration dinner was very enjoyable.

After dinner, everyone went home. Zoey got into Robert's car and went home with him.

The car started and drove for about ten minutes when Zoey noticed they weren't taking the usual route home.

Robert drove that route every day, so he wouldn't have made a mistake.

She didn't mention it, thinking he must have something to do.

Sure enough, Robert stopped the car at a place resembling a farmer's market. "Wait here, I'm going to buy some food. Tenley loves the food from this place."

"Okay."

After Robert got out, Zoey made herself comfortable, leaning sideways on the passenger seat.

She took out her phone to play for a while.

Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a familiar figure through the car window.

Although she had only seen her once, Ruby's beaten appearance was still vivid in her mind, and she recognized her easily.

She saw Ruby holding a child, walking hurriedly through the crowd, as if avoiding something.

Ruby was holding a girl about seven or eight years old. Given her age and thin frame, she soon put the child down.

Ruby looked anxious, constantly making phone calls, but it seemed no one was answering.

She must have made at least seven or eight calls.

Zoey was intently watching Ruby when the car door clicked open.

Robert put the food in the trunk and noticed Zoey looking outside. He curiously asked, "What are you looking at?"

"Officer Davis, wait a moment!" Before Robert could finish, she got out of the car.

She quickly walked through the crowd, crossed the street, and approached Ruby.

Ruby, still making calls, didn't notice her and was startled when Zoey spoke. "Ms. Moore."

Fear spread across Ruby's face, a real reaction, not faked.

If she hadn't seen it was Zoey, she might have fainted from fright.

Seeing it was Zoey, Ruby visibly relaxed, her fear gradually fading until she was calm.

Ruby looked at Zoey, thinking for a moment. "You're the officer from Riverside Police Department today, right?"

"Yes, I'm Zoey Brown."

"Officer Brown, what a coincidence to meet you here."

Zoey also found it quite coincidental. "Yes, I came to buy food and saw you with a child." She glanced at the child Ruby was holding and asked, "It's getting dark. Why are you wandering the streets with a child instead of going home?"

Before she could finish, Ruby's eyes reddened, and she carefully wiped away her tears. "My husband hit me again, worse than last time. I really don't want to stay at home anymore, so I took the child and left. I wanted to stay with a friend, but somehow, my friend isn't answering the phone."

###chapter 59

Zoey asked again, "What about your family?"

"They're out of town, quite far away," Ruby replied.

"And your friend isn't answering the phone, so you're just staying outside?" Zoey glanced at the nearby hotels and pointed, "You should find a place to stay with your child. You can't just wait for your friend."

Zoey could guess why her friend wasn't answering the phone.

Ruby was a woman who was often subjected to domestic violence, and she could always talk about her inner turmoil.

The first time, her friend might be sympathetic, feeling sorry for her and taking her in.

The second time, maybe the same, but by the third or fourth time, she would think Ruby was particularly annoying.

Ruby slowly lowered her head, "I have no money. All the money at home has been squandered by him!"

Zoey looked at Ruby and frowned, "You don't even have money for a hotel?"

"Yeah, I have less than a hundred dollars left. I thought it would be enough for the next few days, but who knew... I can't even afford a cab now."

"Where does your friend live? Even if you take a tour around the city, it shouldn't cost more than fifty dollars." Zoey was now a bit speechless with herself, wondering why she got out of the car.

"If I get a hotel, I won't have money for food."

Zoey asked her unnecessarily, glancing at her, "Oh, then you figure it out yourself. I'm leaving now."

It wasn't that she was heartless, but she also had no money.

And her salary barely covered her own living expenses. If she gave it to Ruby, she would go hungry. So she decided to stay out of it. 

She turned to leave, but Ruby called out to her, "Officer Brown, wait!"

Zoey turned back, giving her a cold look, "What's the matter? I have no money."

"No, it's not about money. Can you help me talk to my husband? My child has school tomorrow, and I haven't heard from my friend. I..."

Zoey guessed her intention, and she hated this kind of thing the most.

She replied extremely coldly, "Sorry, I'm off duty now. If you need help, call 911. It's free to call 911"

Ruby didn't expect that this young-looking girl, who was also a police officer, would have no sympathy at all.

Zoey responded to her so coldly. But Ruby had no one else to turn to.

She could only cry and beg Zoey to help her. She was about to grab Zoey's clothes, but Zoey quickly dodged.

"Officer Brown, I called the cop earlier today. We've met."

"Sorry, I said I'm off duty. If you need anything, call 911." Zoey watched her cry even more, and everyone passing by glanced at them.

"Officer Brown, can't you just be kind?"

Faced with Ruby's repeated pleas, Zoey's attitude became even more unkind, "You reported domestic violence, and we have handled it. You reconciled in front of us, and we gave you a warning. You said you didn't need it, right? Now, after leaving the police station, you got beaten again, and you don't want a divorce. You want me to plead with your husband? Plead for what? For him to hit you lighter next time? Isn't this your own doing?"

Ruby felt even worse being lectured by a young girl like Zoey. "Officer Brown, you can say this because you're young, inexperienced, and not married, so I don't blame you. When you get married and have kids, you'll understand. Divorce isn't that easy. My daughter is still young. Having a father is better than not having one."

Zoey wouldn't be convinced by Ruby's foolishness, "So, you think your so-called motherly love is great? You'd rather let her have a father like that than admit she's living in an unhealthy family? In such a family, what's the difference between having a father and not having one?" Zoey really wanted to laugh at Ruby, who was extremely foolish.

Ruby thought of all she had endured for her child over the years, and Zoey's words made her cry even more, "No, when you have kids, you'll understand."

Zoey didn't want to hear about her misfortune. She had already been bothered by Emma today and didn't want to be bothered a second time.

Besides, Emma had paid for it!

Zoey's eyes unconsciously looked at the girl Ruby was holding. The girl seemed numb to Ruby's crying. There was no trace of the innocence and liveliness of a seven or eight-year-old on her face instead with indifference.

Her indifferent eyes were very out of place on a seven or eight-year-old girl.

At this moment, she was blinking and looking at the unfamiliar Zoey.

Zoey didn't want to deal with Ruby's foolishness and turned to leave.

"Officer Brown!" Ruby called out to Zoey again, "For the sake of us both being women, please help me."

Zoey hated people who were foolish and wanted others to be foolish with them.

Her patience had reached its limit, "Can't you still go to your friend's place?" With that, she left without looking back.

She didn't care about Ruby crying and shouting her name repeatedly.

Zoey was afraid of being stuck with her, so she quickened her pace and returned to the car.

Robert was smoking. When he saw her return, he stubbed out the cigarette with his foot and asked, "Who was that?"

Zoey got into the passenger seat first, and Robert followed.

She briefly recounted the situation to him.

"That's it, Officer Davis," Zoey said as if reporting for duty.

After hearing it, Robert didn't find it surprising, "Domestic violence is common. Not just in your precinct, but even in our criminal investigation department, we get a few domestic violence cases every year. But you know, the ones that reach us are usually where the man accidentally kills the woman, or the woman can't take it anymore and kills the man."

He shrugged helplessly, "The funniest thing about these cases is that when we ask the suspects why they didn't just get a divorce instead of killing, they all say they wouldn't divorce. Isn't that ridiculous?"

For the first time, Zoey felt she could relate to Robert. Because it was indeed ridiculous!

She commented, "Those who don't get divorced are asking for it. If they are willing to bear it, there's no need to report it. Who has time to listen to their suffering?"

"Exactly. There's a book that says marriage is a woman's second choice," Robert suddenly got serious and advised Zoey, "So, you better be careful when choosing a boyfriend."

Zoey had never included having a boyfriend in her life plan, let alone getting married and having kids.

###chapter 60

The two chatted casually and soon arrived at Robert's house.

As soon as the door opened, Tenley greeted them warmly. It seemed she had deliberately stayed up just to see Zoey.

"Zoey, Robert told me everything over the phone. From now on, consider this your home. If you need something, just let me know, and I'll get it for you!"

Zoey thought about her hellish home, and looked at the atmosphere here, feeling mixed.

Back in the bedroom, she lay on the bed, looking at the clean and fragrant room, feeling particularly envious of the room's owner, Kelvin.

Growing up in such a family, Kelvin must be very happy, right?

Everything here was the life she had once longed for.

Unfortunately, her real life made her no longer dare to have such hopes.

Unknowingly, Zoey fell asleep.

The next day at the Riverside Police Department, the intern group had all arrived, except for Zoey.

John, who was mentoring her, didn't think much of it, assuming she was still coordinating with the criminal investigation department, and went about her own business.

Just before noon, he returned to the office with Emma from outside.

Zoey was slacking off at her desk, glancing at John and Emma out of the corner of her eye. They looked like they had been down a garbage heap, covered in dirt and blood.

John grabbed a fresh set of police uniforms from the office and left, presumably to take a shower.

Emma angrily threw her phone on the desk. "So annoying!"

Zoey said coldly, "Hey, every time you come back, you don't care about others' feelings at all. We are working here, can you keep it down?"

"Got it! I'll go clean up now, don't leave! I have something to tell you!" Emma said as she went to clean herself up.

Zoey didn't take it to heart and updated two more ###chapters of her novel.

After finishing, she stretched lazily and closed her laptop with satisfaction, only to see Emma had returned.

Emma first complained about the smell on her, then said, "Do you remember the Ms. Moore I told you about yesterday, the one who was being abused?"

"What about it?" Zoey wasn't really interested. But recalling the blood on Emma's clothes when she returned, she asked, "Did someone die?"

"Sort of," Emma sighed deeply.

Before Zoey could ask, Emma, more eager than Zoey, fearing she might ask for money if she delayed any longer, continued. "Last night, I was patrolling with Mr. Williams when he got a call from Ms. Moore. She said she was being beaten again and urgently needed us to come over. We had to stop patrolling and go rescue her."

"When we got there, Ms. Moore wasn't answering her phone. We searched around the neighborhood entrance but couldn't find her. Worried something had happened, we called the station for her address."

"We rushed over and found Ms. Moore lying on the ground, covered in blood. We were shocked to find she was still breathing and immediately took her to the hospital."

"And guess what? She was pregnant! And her gambling husband beat her so badly she had a miscarriage!" Emma grew more and more furious as she spoke.

But she was just angry, without changing anything.

Zoey had already guessed she would continue to be beaten, but the pregnancy was unexpected. "What about her husband?"

"Don't even mention that bastard! He didn't know she was pregnant, and after beating her so badly, he showed no remorse! He even goes to the internet cafe!" Emma grew angrier, while Zoey found it amusing.

So she said Ruby brought it on herself, which made sense.

Zoey asked, "How was the case handled?"

"That makes me even angrier! She had no money, so Mr. Williams paid for her medical bills. We stayed with her all night, fearing something might happen. The next morning, we even took her daughter to school! I tried to persuade her, but she still wouldn't mention divorce!" Emma gritted her teeth. "Mr. Williams felt sorry for her and suggested filing a case to detain her husband for a few days. But just as you said, she was afraid a criminal record would affect her child and asked us to talk to her husband."

"My God, I've never met someone so stupid in my life!" Emma was almost losing her mind.

She was on the edge of madness. "Why? Zoey. How can someone be so ignorant? Beaten to death and still not divorced?"

Her shouting attracted the attention of her colleagues.

Zoey glanced at her. "Calm down. I told you so much yesterday, and you still didn't listen. If you had taken even one thing to heart, you wouldn't be reacting so strongly."

Ignorance was terrifying, and there would be more cases like this in the future.

If Ruby were a bit smarter, she wouldn't live like a joke.

"But I'm a cop! I can't just stand by and do nothing!" This statement seemed to form a closed loop with what had happened around Emma.

She didn't want to intervene, but seeing Ruby on the brink of disaster made her want to help.

Zoey didn't deny her statement. "You're right, we can't just stand by, but she's not dead, is she? And you've done what you should. Ruby will continue to be beaten. What you witnessed today is just one instance in her life; there will be countless more. She knows it all but still chooses not to divorce. What can you do as a cop?"

"Can you make them divorce? Moreover..." Zoey found Emma's state amusing. "Is it really worth it? Getting so worked up over someone else's business? Especially for someone as ignorant as Ruby, you're wasting your time."

Emma seemed to understand, but also seemed not to fully grasp Zoey's point.

Zoey's theory seemed different from what she had learned in police school. Hearing these words from Zoey for the first time, she couldn't agree or deny them.

As Zoey's words were gradually confirmed by reality. It did seem to be the case.

For instance, in the case of Ruby's domestic violence, Emma thought she should persuade Ruby to divorce, but after several efforts, Ruby still wouldn't mention divorce.

The more she said, the more Ruby showed impatience.

She was trying to help Ruby out of her misery, but Ruby didn't see it that way.

Now she couldn't distinguish between right and wrong.

Maybe Zoey was right! Didn't waste the precious time on someone as ignorant as Ruby!

"Fuck it, I'm not getting involved anymore!" Emma said indignantly.

Zoey saw she finally understood and nodded. "With that time, why not watch a TV show? Why waste it on someone else? If she doesn't want to leave the abyss, you can't pull her out. Some people are used to staying in the abyss, and your effort might even annoy them."

Although Zoey's statements were already very subtle, Emma still understood.

In short, even if she really helped Ruby get a divorce, Ruby wouldn't be grateful. She might even hate her in the future.

"I'm definitely not getting involved this time!" Emma made up her mind.

Zoey didn't say anything more, resting on her desk for a while.

###chapter 61

After a long time,  Zoey and Emma simultaneously woke up by John's calls.

After hanging up, John walked over to Emma, who took off her headphones and glanced at him.

"Ruby said no one can pick up her kid and hopes we can help. You go, I sent the address to your Facebook," John said, frowning with displeasure.

Hearing that, Emma's anger flared up instantly!

She was a cop, not a nanny! This kind of crap seemed not her responsibility!

"Mr. Williams, her husband caused her to miscarry? He can't go to the hospital to take care of her? Can't even find time to pick up the kid? Is that even his biological daughter?" Emma's frustration was palpable.

John was also very impatient. "Her husband got drunk last night and didn't care about Ruby's miscarriage at all. He said losing the baby was fate. You go, otherwise, the kid will be left at school alone and that's really pitiful."

Seeing John say this, Emma had no choice but to endure it.

Although the kid was innocent, wasn't she innocent too?

Emma packed up her things, cursing as she left the police station.

Zoey watched her back, really grateful she got out early, otherwise, she'd be the one being used as free labor now.

When it was time to get off work, Zoey stretched and left the office.

She had just taken a few steps out of the police station when she saw a couple arguing and pulling at each other at a nearby intersection, clearly another dispute to resolve.

Zoey happened to be off the clock and didn't have to deal with these disgusting matters.

Thinking this, her steps quickened.

As she passed by the two, the man yanked the woman far away and slapped her hard.

The sound was loud, indicating how much force he used.

Zoey cursed in her head, thinking only incompetent men would resort to hitting their wives.

Women were already a vulnerable group, it was a shame for men to bully women.

Maybe because of the onlookers, the woman's face swelled up, but she didn't shed a tear. She was much tougher than Ruby. "Fuck! You hit me? In front of the police station!" She said, ready to fight back.

But she was too weak, easily pushed away by the man.

The woman was once again overpowered.

The man raised his hand and slapped the woman again, his eyes full of disgust!

Zoey didn't really want to get involved in this, but there were surveillance cameras at the police station entrance. As a cop, it wouldn't look good if she just walked away.

She thought for a moment, took out her phone, and started recording the two.

The video showed the man slapping the woman several times, the woman unable to fight back, getting beaten up by the man. Only then did Zoey put away her phone and step forward: "Watch your behavior, this is the police station entrance."

"None of your business, get lost!" The man pushed Zoey away.

The woman, afraid of Zoey getting hurt, quickly told her to leave, claiming it was their own matter.

Zoey handed the phone to the woman and helped her position it for recording. "Hold it tight, make sure to get his face. You need to testify for me, he hit first."

The woman looked at her in shock, not understanding what she meant.

The next second, Zoey's eyes turned sharp, and she threw the man over her shoulder, slamming him to the ground.

Still not satisfied, she grabbed the man's hair like dealing with a vicious criminal, pinning one of his arms and lifting his head.

The man was easily subdued by Zoey, his bones making cracking sounds, though he was in too much pain to know which ones.

The woman watched in shock, her mouth opening, unable to process what had just happened.

Quickly, the man realized what was happening and tried to break free with all his might, cursing Zoey. "You dare sneak attack me! I'll kill you now!"

He said, trying to fight back.

Zoey swiftly flashed her badge in front of him. "Try it, see if you prefer getting beaten by me or being charged with assaulting a cop."

The man was stunned.

Seeing the two quiet down, Zoey asked the still-shaken woman. "You want to go to the police station, right?"

The woman, still in shock, just nodded.

Zoey took the phone back from her, stopped the recording, and led the two back to the police station.

As soon as they entered, they ran into John, who was dressed in plain clothes and about to go home.

Zoey forced a smile that looked more and more creepy. "Mr. Williams, we have a situation."

John was silent, wondering if the police station couldn't function without him.

John glanced at the man, who now had a black eye from Zoey's punch.

He then observed the woman and returned his gaze to the beaten man.

The woman was small, the man strong.

He asked, "Are you trained?"

The woman guessed what he meant and awkwardly waved her hand. "I didn't hit him."

Zoey solved John's confusion. "I did."

John was silent, realizing he couldn't go home now.

In the interrogation room, John glanced at the righteous Zoey beside him, recalling her previous case-handling style, and sighed.

He began questioning the man and woman. "What's your name? What do you want to resolve here?"

The woman, both aggrieved and angry, spoke first. "I'm Lucille Morgan, he abuses me! I want to press charges! Look at what he did to me! Officer, you should give him the harshest punishment, don't let him out!"

Hearing Lucille, the man was the first to object. "No, can you speak clearly? Don't let people misunderstand, what do you mean I abuse you? Look at the marks you left on me. Just because I'm a man, I deserve this? I'll press charges against you for abuse too!"

The man turned to John. "I'm Paul Howard, her husband. I can't take it anymore, she always scratches me! Look, if she presses charges, I will too!"

Lucille added, "What do you mean by that? Am I not telling the truth? Didn't you abuse me!"

Paul retorted. "Abuse you? I pushed you once, and you call that abuse? You always bring up everything from before we dated, if your memory is so good, why don't you remember something useful?"

Lucille snapped, "Stop with the nonsense, you did abuse me! You not only pushed me, but also slapped me."

###chapter 62

"If you didn't insult my family, I wouldn't hit you. And I just slap you. You can insult people, but I can't hit you? Are you a shrew?" Paul said.

"What a joke! You say I insulted your family; that's because you insult my family first."

Seeing the two getting more and more intense, it was as if they had turned the police station into their home.

John's helpless eyes showed a trace of speechlessness. He patted the table. "Silence, do you think this is your home? Do you know where you are? This is the police station, not your home, everyone shut up!"

The couple saw John getting angry and finally restrained themselves a bit.

But the looks they gave each other were still full of defiance.

If it weren't for the authority of the police station holding them back, they would have started fighting again in the next second.

John frowned deeply, his gaze casually fell on Lucille. "You reported the case, you speak first."

"Officer, why is it that she reported the case first? Clearly, we came together. I'm the victim!" Paul said, rolling up his sleeve. "Look! She twisted me, it's all bruised and purple, whose wife hits this hard."

"Alright, everyone shut up first!" John irritably patted the table, stopping them from continuing to argue. "I already understand your situation, it doesn't count as domestic violence, it's just a family dispute."

"What is the definition of domestic violence? Look at how she hit me!" Lucille was dissatisfied with John's statement and showed him her injuries.

Paul, feeling he had found support, was secretly a bit smug that the law didn't recognize this as domestic violence. "Alright, you're showing your arm, should I show mine?"

He extended his hand to show her.

Neither of them was willing to back down, both expressing their grievances, and wanting to play the victim in front of the police.

Lucille couldn't win arguments at home, and she was still at a disadvantage here. No matter how strong she was, she was still a girl.

Plus, with Paul playing the victim, Lucille's emotions were even more agitated than before. "You dare to play the victim first!" She couldn't understand, thinking she was clearly the weaker party in the eyes of the law. Why wasn't this considered domestic violence?

She bit her lip lightly, her gaze fixed on Paul, who was still indifferent, and his casual posture clearly mocking her.

Lucille was almost driven to tears by his smugness, but she had no other way.

John had already spoken, and there wasn't much point in persisting.

At this moment, Zoey leisurely took out her phone from her pocket, silently opened the video she had just recorded, and placed it next to John. "Mr. Williams, I also want to report a case."

John was stunned for a moment, a complex expression circling Zoey's face.

He thought, 'Can't she see I am interrogating someone? Why is she causing trouble?'

"What's up, Zoey?" John still asked symbolically.

Zoey, seeing John speak, began to explain. "I want to report Paul for assaulting me, an officer. At 6:01 PM, I saw him hitting Lucille right after I got off work. I went up to intervene, but he not only didn't listen but also insulted me. After multiple warnings, he still insisted on fighting me."

After speaking, the video started playing, showing Zoey and Paul fighting earlier.

Paul was shocked.

Lucille was shocked and confused.

Paul felt more wronged than Zoey. "Wait, are you sure I assaulted you? Or did you fail to intervene and hit me?" Clearly, Zoey had hit him so hard he couldn't even defend himself, but she wanted to report him.

"Why did you record it?" Paul asked.

Zoey told him seriously. "Even if I didn't record it, do you think there are no cameras at the entrance of the police station? I just saved the trouble of checking the surveillance footage." She remembered the days she spent checking surveillance footage in the criminal investigation team; it was too time-consuming.

Hearing that, Paul was silent.

John carefully watched the content of her video and, from an objective standpoint, said. "From the video, Mr. Howard's assaults on Ms. Morgan indeed constitute assault. The force he used and the extent of Ms. Morgan's retaliation are not on the same level, and the harm he caused her is substantial, while her retaliation did not cause substantial harm, and several hits didn't even connect. This can indeed be filed as an assault case, with detention of more than five days but less than ten days, and a fine of $200 to $500."

Lucille was very satisfied with this result, her previously gloomy expression instantly brightened.

"Thank you, Mr. Williams, quickly arrest this bad man Paul!" She mocked Paul while thanking Zoey with her eyes. "Thank you, Madam."

Zoey's expression did not improve. "My name is Zoey Brown. And Ms. Morgan has already testified, Mr. Williams, did you hear? Paul hit me."

Lucille was stunned again. "Yes, that's right."

John had worked with Zoey for a while and naturally knew her temperament, so he warned her with his eyes not to cause trouble.

Zoey gave him a look that told him she was just telling the truth.

Seeing John's response, she didn't say more.

After Zoey 'reported the case,' the atmosphere in the interrogation room changed. Paul, realizing all the evidence was against him, began to resist. "No, how is this assault? This is just a little quarrel between our couple, I didn't hurt her badly. Isn't this just a bit of fun between our couple?"

"Who has fun with you? You bastard!" Lucille cursed.

"I'm telling the truth, you're my wife, and we have marriage documents, how can this be assault? Mr. Williams, you have to stand up for me."

Zoey knocked on the table, signaling Paul to stop arguing, and explained the law to him. "The law does not exclude spouses from this provision. Just because she married you doesn't mean you can hit and insult her at will! Unless you provide proof of a mental illness, proving you have a mental disorder!"

"No..."

John said sternly. "This place is under surveillance, from the moment we came in, it's all been recorded. If you think my judgment is wrong, you can hire a lawyer! If not, sign this!"

Paul, furious and glaring at Lucille as if he wanted to kill her, finally unwillingly signed his name.

###chapter 63

After resolving the dispute, Zoey got off work.

Lucille followed closely behind and walked out as well. She saw Zoey's righteous demeanor, which might have been accentuated by the police station.

She couldn't tell if it was Zoey's inherent aura or something else.

The two of them walked together towards the subway station. Lucille thought for a moment, then quickly caught up and sincerely thanked her, "Officer Brown, thank you so much for what you did earlier. If you hadn't recorded the video in advance, I might have come here for nothing today, and who knows what might have happened when I got home tonight."

Zoey thought about Lucille's hatred towards Paul earlier and wondered if she might be different from other fools.

At least, when she mentioned Paul assaulting an officer, Lucille didn't try to plead for him.

Zoey paused, turned back, and asked, "Why don't you divorce him if he hits you?"

A bitter smile appeared on Lucille's lips, "I've known him since I was eighteen. We dated for six years and just got married a year ago. Now, I don't know if it's my sharpness that provoked him or if he's been pretending too well these past few years. I find it hard to let go and want to see how he'll treat me in the future."

Zoey nodded coldly. Compared to other foolish people, Lucille wasn't too foolish.

She reminded her, "Once domestic violence occurs, it's hard to stop. I hope you wake up early if it happens a second time. Don't let the past hinder a beautiful future."

"Thank you, Officer Brown. I'm definitely not the type to continue suffering."

Zoey's subway arrived, and she didn't have time to see if Lucille would continue talking. She got on the subway and said goodbye to Lucille.

It wasn't just Lucille; in a few days, she would be saying goodbye to this place as well.

She was about to transfer to a new job.

After one transfer, it took less than half an hour to reach Robert's house by subway.

Even though she was now renting this house, she still felt a bit awkward every time she opened the door.

As she opened the door, Tenley and Robert were sitting on the couch watching TV. Tenley was leaning on Robert's shoulder, looking like a loving couple. When Tenley saw Zoey return, she immediately got up from the couch.

Her smile was warm and penetrating. "Zoey, you're back so quickly. I thought it would be another half hour. Wait a moment, I'll heat up the food! Dinner's ready!"

Robert turned off the TV and chimed in, "I'll help you!" He then told Zoey to wash her hands and get ready for dinner.

When Zoey returned to the dining table, it was already filled with various dishes, both meat and vegetarian, all meticulously prepared. She could tell at a glance that she hadn't eaten any of them before. She was worried that her month's rent wasn't enough to cover this meal.

"Mrs. Davis, Officer Davis, did you wait for me to eat?" Zoey said.

Tenley replied, "We're not hungry. Besides, it's more lively with more people at the table."

"But..." Zoey felt a bit embarrassed and continued, "Next time, you don't have to wait for me. It's too much trouble."

"How could it be trouble!" Tenley sat down and took a bag from beside the table, smiling as she handed it to Zoey, "Open it and see if it fits. If not, I'll exchange it."

"What?" Zoey took the bag and opened it to find a new pair of pajamas, which were pink that girls would love at first sight.

Holding a corner of the pajamas, Zoey felt a pang of emotion.

From childhood to adulthood, her biological parents had never bought her a brand-new piece of clothing.

All her clothes were hand-me-downs from her cousins.

Lena would tell her that as long as they fit, there was no need to be picky.

Then she would turn around and buy several new outfits for Derek.

Zoey felt a moment of sadness. Tenley continued, "How do you like it, Zoey?"

Zoey replied, "Yes, I like it very much. It's very cute."

Tenley smiled brightly upon hearing Zoey's approval, "I knew you would like it!"

Zoey put away the pajamas, and the food was ready.

The three of them sat at the dining table, and the couple chatted while eating, creating a happy atmosphere Zoey had never experienced.

To make her feel more comfortable and less awkward, they occasionally included her in the conversation.

To have something in common with Zoey, they often talked about Kelvin.

"Kelvin is such a nerd. It would have been nice to have a daughter," Tenley said, looking at Zoey with increasing fondness, "I really love kids. If we weren't an ordinary family, I would have had more."

"Kelvin is good too," Robert said proudly, "Kelvin skipped two grades in school. We were worried he wouldn't keep up, but he ended up being the top of his class."

"What's the use of being top of the class? He even becomes a nerd!" Tenley kept teasing Kelvin, while Robert kept defending him.

Despite this, Zoey could feel their love for Kelvin.

Zoey grew increasingly envious of Kelvin. If only she had grown up in such a family. Tenley and Robert were both well-educated and loved their children, as she had observed during her time with them.

They were upright and morally sound people.

Listening to their banter, Zoey's eating slowed down.

Looking at the dish closest to her, the voices of Robert and Tenley grew fainter, and past memories played in her mind like a movie.

She remembered it was when she was in middle school.

It was snowing heavily outside, and she was curled up, using the coffee table as a desk to do her homework.

To finish before Lena started cooking, she had to work quickly.

After dinner, the living room lights would be turned off, and Fiona never turned on the lights. She shared a tiny room with Fiona, which had only a wardrobe against the wall and a bed right by the door.

There was no room to move, let alone a desk.

Sometimes she envied Derek. His room was big, with a large desk and all kinds of toys he liked.

Back then, she was just envious. Lena had given her an irrefutable reason: since Fiona was still around, she had to share a room with her, while Derek, being a boy, needed his own room.

But young Zoey didn't understand why she and Fiona's room was so much smaller than Derek's.

"Pat, put your homework aside. You're so good at studying that even if you don't do it, the teacher won't say anything. Come help with the cooking!"

###chapter 64

Zoey finished her homework just before Lena called her. She carefully placed her notebook in her backpack and responded, "Okay."

She got up and walked towards the kitchen, but Derek stopped her halfway, "You finished your homework, right? Now you need to teach me!" He didn't have the slightest attitude of someone asking for help; instead, he spoke as if it was Zoey's duty.

Back in middle school, Derek wasn't as tall as Zoey, but he was overfed and extremely fat.

She replied, "Wait a bit, I'll teach you after I finish cooking."

"I have to go out and play later, I can't wait until you finish cooking! Mom will check my homework soon, are you trying to cause trouble?" Derek shouted at her, showing no respect to Zoey.

Zoey, even if she had no choice, couldn't say anything.

This had happened too many times since they were kids.

She looked at Derek, feeling uncomfortable inside, but still called out to Lena in the kitchen, "Mom, Derek wants me to teach him his homework now."

Lena heard this and didn't want to delay his studies because of her, "Then teach Derek first, his studies are more important than cooking!"

"Okay." Zoey followed Derek into the room, and Derek closed the door behind them.

He lazily lay on the bed and started playing with his toys. He pointed to the homework on the desk, "You do it, hurry up, finish it in twenty minutes. I have plans to play with my friends."

"Why should I do it for you? I only agreed to teach you!"

"What's the difference?" Derek said unhappily, "Even if you teach me, I won't get it. To save both of our time, it's faster if you just do it for me."

Zoey looked at Derek with his legs crossed, feeling the urge to kick him.

Because their parents favored Derek over Zoey, he also followed suit and bullied her.

Previously, their parents helped with his homework, but now that they weren't around, Derek asked her to do his homework with an arrogant attitude.

"I won't do it. If you don't want to learn, I'm leaving." Zoey didn't indulge him at all and turned to leave.

Helping with his homework here was less appealing than helping Lena cook.

Seeing Zoey about to leave, Derek jumped off the bed in a flash, "If you dare to leave, I'll scream! Believe it or not!" He threatened Zoey, "I'll scream right away! Don't think Mom will believe you over me. I'll just say you came in and started being mean to me and refused to help with my homework!"

Zoey laughed at his stupidity, "You think you're the only one who can tattle? I will do it too."

"Well, do you think Mom and Dad will take your side?" Derek still thought she was foolish.

Zoey firmly refused to indulge his attitude, "What do you think?"

"I think as long as I cry, Mom will definitely believe me!" He already imagined the scene, as long as he cried, the whole family would revolve around him, regardless of whether he was right or wrong, their parents would always center on him.

After all, it had always been this way since they were kids.

Zoey didn't understand why her relationship with Derek had become like this.

She always gave in to Derek because she was his sister, and they were siblings with the same parents. As his sister, Zoey felt she should be good to Derek and let him have his way. How did it become something he took for granted?

"Do you think I've been too good to you, making you have such thoughts?" Zoey snapped.

Derek looked at Zoey with a mocking smile, "Come on, even if you're not good to me, Mom, Dad, and Grandma will be. They don't like you; they only like me. Grandma even said you're just a maid in our family."

"A maid?" Zoey had heard Derek say things like this many times.

She had heard it so often that she thought she was used to it.

But at this moment, Zoey didn't think Derek was joking; he was seriously expressing his attitude of giving orders to a 'maid.' She didn't know why it had come to this.

Then she naturally started to recall and doubt. Compared to the previous confusion, once she began to doubt, confirming the answer was actually quick and easy.

From attending the same elementary school as Derek, she always sat in the back seat while Lena drove, never enjoying the closer front seat.

As she grew older, Lena even stopped bothering to take her to school or pick her up, always saying Derek was younger and couldn't be left alone.

So, at a young age, Zoey carried her backpack through the crowds of people going to and from school.

She walked for a long time every day, so she got several blisters on her heels. When she asked Lena what to do, she just said, to soak them in hot water.

Lena got up and left, not caring about her, but turned to bring Derek water to wash his feet.

Even if Derek splashed the water everywhere, Lena didn't scold him at all but looked at him indulgently.

She kept telling herself, Derek was her brother and younger than her, so she could do better than Derek, and didn't need Lena.

As long as she was there, no one in the family washed dishes; it was always she who had to wash them, from the first time helping to later becoming a habit.

She wanted a few books to study, but Lena thought it was a waste and unnecessary, suggesting she borrow from others. But when Derek wanted comic books and toy cars, a bit of whining got him everything.

Even when she argued with Derek, they always said, "You're Derek's sister, let him have his way!"

If she showed her displeasure, all she got were their annoyed expressions.

In fact, Derek hadn't respected her in a long time.

She always thought she was a good sister, but everything in the past was just what she thought.

"Hey, Pat, can't you understand what I'm saying?" Derek's voice brought her back.

Zoey could clearly feel someone pushing her.

She slowly opened her eyes, breaking free from the overwhelming memories.

At that moment, she was shattered.

Her eyes were lifeless as she looked at Derek, who was pointing and ordering her around.

Indeed, she should have been used to him yelling at her by now.

For years, he had never respected her.

And now, the name Pat was like a sharp blade, piercing her heart.

She really hated that name.

###chapter 65

Her female classmates all had cute or meaningful names, hoping their children could grow up happily. But what did her name, 'Pat,' mean?

Zoey never really cared about her name before, but she suddenly understood today.

In her parents' hearts, perhaps she shouldn't have been born in the first place because she wasn't a boy. So no matter how well she studied, how hard she worked, or how excellent she was, it meant nothing to her family.

They needed a son to inherit the family business.

Even if Derek was nothing, he could still carry on the Brown Family.

His significance was immense, and being pampered was what their parents thought he deserved.

Indeed, from the moment Zoey was born, they had told her that they only considered Derek their biological child.

"Pat, I'm talking to you, can't you hear?" Derek cursed, "Are you going to help me with my homework or not!"

Zoey refocused her gaze on him, and from that moment on, her feelings for Derek completely changed.

Not only her gaze but also the heart that once thought it loved Derek underwent a drastic transformation.

She refused Derek's shameless request, "Don't even think about it. If you want to tattle, go ahead! Idiot!"

Derek was stunned when he heard Zoey curse at him, and then saw her walk out of the room.

He followed her out, heading straight to the kitchen, and started complaining to Lena, "Mom, she won't help me with my homework and called me an idiot!"

Lena, who was cooking, didn't ask for details and immediately scolded Zoey, "How can you call Derek names? What's wrong with helping him with his homework? I think you're just too idle with nothing better to do! It seems that I should teach you a lesson."

Zoey seemed to have anticipated Lena's reaction.

She wasn't angry but looked at her calmly, " Derek wants me to do his homework for him so he can go out and play. He even gave me a time limit of twenty minutes to finish it."

Derek didn't expect Zoey to talk back and was so anxious that he jumped up, "Mom, she's lying! Our handwriting is different, and the teacher would notice right away. She just doesn't want to help me and called me names!"

"Don't worry, Derek, I'll make sure to stand up for you," Lena comforted Derek, then turned to Zoey with a fierce look, "Pat, you're getting more and more out of line, bullying Derek and lying!"

Fiona had just come out of her room and heard that Zoey had bullied Derek.

Without caring about what had happened, she walked over to Zoey and pinched her arm hard, scolding, "Pat has been bad since she was little. Let me teach her a lesson! Pat, you're getting more and more out of line!"

Zoey's fingers trembled with pain, but she stubbornly refused to shed a tear.

Her fierce gaze moved from Derek to Lena, and finally to Fiona.

"You believe him that much, huh?" Zoey endured the pain and walked to Derek's room, rummaging through his backpack to find his homework.

Not only was today's homework not done, but the previous ones were also incomplete.

"Nothing is done, see? He hasn't learned anything the teacher taught. He should at least write something, right? He hasn't written a single word. You have money to buy toys, but you should take him to the hospital to check his intelligence! Maybe he is a fool!" Zoey retorted.

Derek was stunned.

He didn't expect the usually submissive Zoey to stand up for herself.

He stood there, looking helpless, his eyes pleading with Lena and Fiona, "Mom, Grandma."

At this moment, Lena and Fiona still sided with him.

"How can you curse Derek? It's just a homework assignment, and you say he is a fool? I think you're the one who needs to go to the hospital to see what's wrong with you!"

"I agree, you're the one who needs to go to the hospital! Stop cursing Derek!" Fiona echoed.

She was afraid Derek would suffer, so she tightly protected him in her arms.

With Fiona protecting him, Derek gained confidence. He thought, 'Pat wants to compete with me. Dream on!'

Fiona was furious at Zoey's resentful gaze, "What are you looking at? I think I treat you too nice, right!" She said, ready to teach Zoey a lesson.

Lena chimed in, "Alright, stop standing there like an idiot, go call your dad for dinner."

Zoey couldn't be bothered with them, directly ignoring the three of them, and sat down at the dining table.

"Lena, you're spoiling her!" Fiona cursed and was about to discipline her.

At this moment, Gordon stretched and came out of the room, sitting down at the dining table and starting to eat.

No one dared to discipline Zoey anymore, and they all sat down to eat.

The meat at home was usually out of Zoey's reach. Whenever she tried to take some, Fiona and Lena would give her a look.

Today, Zoey completely ignored them and directly took the biggest piece of meat into her bowl.

"Hey, don't eat my meat!" Derek shouted at Zoey, his eyes full of warning.

"Pat," Lena said sternly, "Derek is growing, don't take his food, give it to him."

Fiona's voice was sharper than Lena's, "Pat, didn't you hear what your mom said?"

Zoey pretended not to hear and continued eating the meat in her bowl.

Derek's whining made it impossible to eat, "My meat! Dad, Mom, Grandma, look at her!"

"Derek, don't cry." Fiona glared at Zoey, looking like a vengeful ghost.

She didn't care if Zoey liked it or not, she directly took the meat from her bowl and put it in Derek's.

Derek looked at her triumphantly, as if declaring war.

Zoey continued to ignore him, glancing at her parents, who were eating without any intention of scolding Derek.

This scene made Zoey laugh. How could they possibly scold Derek?

Indeed, she was being ridiculous, expecting too much.

Zoey looked at the food in her bowl and suddenly wondered how she had survived in such a disgusting family for over ten years.

She lost her appetite, threw down her utensils, and looked at them, "You really raised a good son."

###chapter 66

"What do you mean by saying that?" Zoey's parents were extremely dissatisfied with her words and almost in unison retorted to defend Derek.

Zoey just found them ridiculous, snorted coldly, and said nothing more.

Her sneer was enough to explain everything.

Seeing Zoey like this, Fiona decided not to indulge her anymore.

Fiona snatched her bowl away. "Alright, you don't eat! Wait until Derek finishes eating before you eat! A person like you needs to be taught a lesson!" Fiona scolded, and pushed Zoey's head, pushing her away from the table.Zoey remained silent. After being with such a family for a long time, she didn't even get angry anymore.

She firmly believed that overindulging a child was harming them.

Derek's bad habits would not serve him well in society in the future.

Thinking of this, she felt relieved.

Her family still wanted to instill bad thoughts in her, but they would never be able to exploit her again in this lifetime.

"So, does this mean I don't have to eat?" Zoey looked at them and asked calmly.

"Isn't it obvious? From now on, don't come to the table when we eat!" Fiona abruptly said, then put another piece of meat on Derek's plate to coax him. "Dear Derek, eat more."

Derek happily accepted Fiona's offering, extremely pleased. "Okay." He thought to himself, 'This is how Zoey should be treated.'

Zoey slammed the bowl on the table and stood up with a calm expression.

The others thought Zoey was done eating.

Lena didn't forget to remind her. "Finish your homework and then clean up the house!"

Derek, seeing his family siding with him, made a triumphant face at her.

Seeing Derek happy, Fiona was also happy, smiling as she comforted Derek. "Oh, Derek, you are growing and need to eat more."

Fiona put another piece of chicken in his bowl.

Then, with a 'crash', all the food on the table was overturned.

The sudden change left everyone except Zoey stunned.

They looked at each other, but no one spoke. Zoey's actions had clearly shocked them.

"I'm not eating, and neither are you!" Zoey deliberately stepped back as the food fell, avoiding getting any on herself.

Instead, it splattered all over her parents, Fiona, and Derek, and the kitchen was instantly a mess.

Gordon still held his bowl, glaring at Zoey with a fierce look.

He threw his bowl to the ground, making a sharp sound.

A slap landed on Zoey's face, instantly making her cheek red and swollen.

She felt a burning sensation on her left cheek, a stinging pain.

Fiona, seeing Zoey get hit, sat on the ground and started her performance.

She slapped her thigh, crying and wailing. "She is really something! Flipping the table while we are eating! She doesn't respect me at all."

She cried while observing Gordon and Lena's reactions.

Seeing they were unmoved, she wailed even louder. "She's too much, I can't live anymore."

"Pat, you've gone too far this time!" Lena yelled at Zoey, then turned to get a belt and handed it to Gordon.

Her intention was clear; they had to teach Zoey a good lesson today.

The belt quickly reached Gordon's hand, and Fiona stopped crying, standing up to watch the show, which was eager to see Zoey being hit.

Gordon seemed to understand Fiona's thoughts, picked up the belt, and swung it heavily at Zoey. "Kneel down!"

Why should she kneel? What did she do wrong?

Because she didn't let them persuade her like before and continued to foolishly tolerate Derek? It was ridiculous.

Zoey glanced at her family, who didn't treat her as one of their own, sneered, and turned to leave.

Fiona, seeing her trying to run, moved swiftly despite usually needing a cane, and grabbed Zoey's hand. "Where are you going, you bitch!"

Despite her age, Fiona was strong, and didn't give Zoey any chance to break free.

Zoey was no match for Fiona, her petite frame easily restrained, unable to escape.

Seeing this, Gordon picked up the belt and started hitting Zoey. As the belt landed, Zoey felt her back burning as if on fire.

Then someone kicked her from behind, almost making her fall.

She turned to see Derek looking at her smugly, realizing even Derek dared to hit her.

Zoey couldn't fight back against her parents, but hitting Derek was no problem.

Her eyes turned fierce as she slowly got up from the ground.

Ignoring Gordon and Lena's shouts, she walked straight towards Derek.

Derek's smug smile faded as he saw Zoey approaching.

Her murderous look made Derek feel threatened. "What... what are you doing?"

Zoey raised her hand and slapped Derek's fat face.

Derek instinctively backed away, stepping on the spilled food, and fell flat on his back.

Derek cried out in pain, tears streaming down his face.

He had sat on a broken plate, which cut into his flesh.

"Blood, I'm going to die, it's all blood." Derek looked at his bleeding hand, eyes wide with fear.

Gordon, forgetting about hitting Zoey, rushed to Derek's side. "Derek, are you okay?"

Fiona, seeing Derek bleeding, hurried over to comfort him. "Oh my Derek, does it hurt? Let me see if it hurts. Why are you all standing there, call an ambulance! Go to the hospital!"

###chapter 67

Gordon approached, also startled by the blood-covered Derek.

Upon closer inspection, they found that only Derek's hand was bleeding, and everyone finally breathed a sigh of relief.

He was the only son of the Brown Family. If Derek had injured an important part of his body, they definitely wouldn't let Zoey go.

"Dad, it hurts."

"Mom, it hurts."

"Grandma, it hurts so much, I'm going to die from the pain."

Derek cried like a baby, and the three people surrounded him, saying every comforting word they knew in their lifetime.

Zoey looked at the harmonious family of four and had a thought.

Since they all hated her so much, why did they let her be born?

If they didn't like her, they could have strangled her. Was it just because of the death penalty for murder?

At the very least, they could have abandoned her, and let wild beasts eat her, and it would have been better than now.

Even though she was in pain all over, seeing Derek's miserable state, a smile appeared on her lips.

When they hit her, all four of them were happy.

When Derek got hurt, all four of them were upset.

She just wanted to make them upset.

If they weren't busy taking care of Derek, they would probably hit her again if they saw her smile, right?

Everyone felt that the obedient and quiet Zoey had changed, she became a completely different person.

They were in such a hurry to check on Derek that they didn't have time to pay attention to her.

The subtle change started from that moment.

Transferring Zoey from the Riverside Police Department to the City Police Department wasn't something Robert could decide alone; it required a lot of procedures. So during this time, Zoey was still working at the Riverside Police Department.

Her daily routine consisted of trivial matters.

Aside from these trivial matters, her days were relatively peaceful.

Time passed peacefully, and Zoey thought her days at the Riverside Police Department would continue to be this peaceful. But one late night, she received a phone call.

Seeing the unfamiliar number, Zoey initially thought it was a scam call.

When she answered, a weak, trembling voice slowly spoke. "Officer Brown, are you available now?"

Zoey was the top graduate of the police academy and could determine what was happening on the other end just by someone's voice.

She guessed they might have been fighting and asked, "Lucille, what's wrong? Did you get beaten again?"

After asking this, there was a long silence on the other end, lasting about tens of seconds, before a very faint voice answered, "Yes, I, I hit him too."

Zoey said, "Are you seriously injured? If it's serious, listen to me. Take photos of your injuries with your phone, and I'll call an ambulance for you. You need to get a medical examination immediately."

Lucille responded, "Okay."

"Where's your husband, Paul?"

"He's not here."

Zoey replied, "Bring all your documents. We'll meet at the hospital. Do you understand?"

"Okay, I'm going right away." Lucille choked up, and they ended the call.

Zoey hung up and told John about it. John was busy with Emma at the time and didn't say much, just reminded her to be safe and avoid physical confrontation with Paul. He was worried she might get hurt.

Zoey agreed and headed to Haven Healthcare Hospital.

After all, it was the city center, and even at night, there were still many people. Family members of patients were accompanying them for walks.

Some were paying bills for patients, and others were bringing food to patients, where everyone seemed busy.

With her keen eyes, Zoey scanned the crowd and began looking for Lucille.

Soon, she saw Lucille in the waiting area on the second floor. From the side, she looked particularly distracted, nervously clutching her backpack, which was large and bulging with unknown contents.

Beside her was a medium-sized suitcase, wrapped in a layer of cloth.

"Are they planning to separate for good?"Zoey asked. Otherwise, there was no need for Lucille to bring all these things.

When Lucille saw Zoey, her vacant eyes seemed to light up, but her eyes were black and blue from being hit, showing how hard Paul had punched her.

Her mouth was also injured, and she had applied a layer of lipstick over the wound, which showed a hint of a weary beauty.

"Officer Brown, you got here so quickly. I haven't even gotten in line yet." Lucille said.

Zoey responded, glancing at her. "Did you bring everything?"

"I brought everything you told me to."

"Good." Zoey's gaze fell on the cloth-covered suitcase, and after some hesitation, she asked, "What's in the suitcase?"

"It's filled with the most important things." Lucille smiled slightly, without answering directly.

She gave Zoey a look, signaling her to check for herself.

Zoey lifted the cloth, opened the suitcase, and bent down to see a pair of sapphire blue eyes staring back at her.

Zoey stood up speechlessly. "Why did you bring a cat?"

"It's my baby, of course, I have to bring it."

"What about the documents?"

"I brought everything you told me to!" Lucille said as she reached into the cat carrier to pet the fluffy, cute cat.

Lucille wanted to say more, but the nurse called her number. She responded and handed all her belongings to Zoey.

"Thank you, Officer Brown. I'll be out soon." Lucille greeted her and followed the nurse inside.

Zoey looked at the crowded waiting area and sat in Lucille's previous seat.

Feeling bored, she took out her phone to pass the time.

The suitcase was left open to let the cat breathe fresh air.

The little cat seemed as bored as she was, scratching inside the carrier.

The sharp sound made Zoey very uncomfortable.

She put down her phone and lifted the white cloth covering the carrier. "Little one, are you as bored as I am?"

The cat lazily looked at her. "Meow."

"What's your name?"

"Meow."

The person next to her seemed to dislike cats; they glanced at Zoey with an annoyed look.

Zoey covered the carrier again, not wanting to disturb others.

But the cat seemed to dislike being alone or was scared of the crowd, meowing continuously.

###chapter 68

The people around her looked at her with even more impatience. Even if they didn't say anything, their eyes seemed to say, "How annoying! How could you bring a cat to the hospital?"

Zoey sternly warned the cat, "Shut up!"

"Meow."

Zoey fell silent.

She had never raised these things before, so she mimicked Lucille and reached her hand into the cat carrier.

The kitten cautiously sniffed her hand and then unexpectedly licked her finger.

Zoey was shocked.

She immediately withdrew her hand and took out a tissue she carried with her, wiping her hand vigorously several times.

To keep the cat quiet, Zoey had to keep reaching her hand in and out of the carrier, teasing it.

After several rounds of this, until she didn't know how many times she had done it, her hand got stuck in the carrier.

The cat stopped meowing, but it hurt so much that she wanted to scream.

After covering the cat carrier with a white cloth again, she looked at it speechlessly.

Because of the white cloth, neither the person nor the cat could see each other's faces.

At this moment, Lucille had just finished her check-up and came out, returning to Zoey's side. "The doctor told me the injury report will take about a week to come out. I definitely won't go back home."

"Then where can you go?" Zoey asked.

Lucille thought for a moment. "Probably to my friend's place." She said, looking a bit embarrassed at Zoey.

It was obvious she wanted to trouble her.

Zoey could easily see what she meant but still asked, "Why are you looking at me like that?"

"My friend is allergic to cat hair. She might take me in, but the cat..."

Zoey didn't care about others' business. If it weren't for her duty to accompany Lucille to the hospital for the injury report, she wouldn't be here late at night. "That's a shame, then you should stay at a hotel."

Seeing that Zoey wasn't taking the hint, Lucille decided to be direct. "Officer Brown, can you take care of the cat for a while? I'll find a place as soon as possible, and once I do, I'll take the cat back. You don't have to worry about cat litter or cat food, I'll cover all the costs."

"I really can't help you." She was currently staying at Robert's house.

She didn't know if Robert and Tenley liked cats, and bringing one home without asking would disrespect the owners.

"Fifty dollars a day!" Lucille's eyes were determined, intent on making Zoey change her mind.

Zoey was silently calculating in her mind.

She was paying three hundred dollars a month to stay at Robert's house, and Lucille was offering fifty dollars a day.

Taking care of the cat for a week, although a bit annoying, would cover a month's rent, making it a good deal.

Zoey took a barely noticeable deep breath. "Wait a moment, I'll make a call."

She remembered Tenley telling her that when Kelvin was little, she had taken care of a few stray cats. But over the years, those cats gradually passed away. Tenley was very sad.

When she mentioned it to Zoey, there were still tears in her eyes.

It was clear she considered those stray cats her family.

The couple probably liked pets but hated the feeling of loss.

Zoey thought that if Tenley agreed to let the kitten stay for a few days, she would give the money she earned to Tenley.

The call connected, and Zoey directly stated her request.

Tenley's voice was enthusiastic with a hint of excitement. "Of course! It doesn't matter how long it stays."

"Thank you, Mrs. Davis."

After hanging up, Zoey told Lucille the result, so the matter was temporarily settled.

Lucille gratefully held Zoey's hand. "Thank you so much, Officer Brown. Can you come with me to my house later? The cat supplies are all at home. I'll help you carry them and take a cab to your place."

"Okay."

The two left the hospital, and Lucille struggled to carry the cat carrier as they walked outside.

Zoey looked at her visible injuries, thinking about how she had just been abused and her wounds hadn't healed yet. She said, "Let me carry it. If your wounds tear again, it'll take longer to heal."

"Thank you, Officer Brown." To lighten Zoey's load, Lucille took the cat out of the carrier.

She kept petting it in her arms.

"Look, my baby is so brave," Lucille said proudly, as if showing off her child.

"The cat is so small, how brave can it be?" Zoey told her to put the cat back in the carrier. "There are too many people here. Aren't you afraid someone might scream and scare the cat? If it gets scared, I won't compensate you."

"Don't worry, it's professionally trained." Lucille, holding her cat, led Zoey back to her neighborhood.

Lucille opened the door, revealing a chaotic scene inside.

Everything in sight was either broken or lying haphazardly on the floor. The tiles on the floor were also chipped, showing how intense the fight had been.

Taking a deep breath, she went to gather the cat's things.

Lucille said, "I knew he wouldn't come back, but coming back alone still scares me. Officer Brown, having you by my side makes me feel less afraid. Thank you."

Zoey looked at her back, hearing the sadness in her voice.

In such situations, she couldn't offer comfort.

Instead, she asked Tenley lightly, "How long do you plan to keep him locked up this time?"

Lucille turned back with a bitter smile. "I'm actually a bit hesitant. I don't know how to view our relationship. When he first hit me and got detained, I thought about what would happen if we got divorced."

"Then I thought about it and felt that divorce would be a relief. You know, when I was single, I was so happy. After being with him, I felt my happiness decrease. I had to take care of him. I thought these were things a housewife should do, so I endured it. After all, marriage is about living for two people. I could tolerate it. But my tolerance didn't make him appreciate me; instead, he hit me."

"I really feel like I'm worth less than a free maid."

After saying this, Lucille wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes. "I really wonder what I was thinking, why I wanted to get married."

Zoey, having encountered many 'domestic violence' cases and women who tried to convince themselves, finally met someone who understood.

Lucille's words made Zoey willing to say a few more words to her. "It's nothing, just think of it as accidentally getting trash on you. Now you're kicking the trash away, isn't it the same?"

Lucille nodded in agreement. "You're absolutely right, Officer Brown!"

###chapter 69

Lucille started packing again, but after less than three seconds, she thought of another question. "By the way, Officer Brown, what if he doesn't agree to the divorce? After all, I don't think anyone but me could choose him."

"You can file for divorce. You have the injury report as evidence of his domestic violence, and there's also the police statement. That's enough." Zoey added, "If he keeps pestering you and refuses to divorce, just call me directly!"

"Okay!" Lucille quickly finished packing, mostly cat supplies which were easier to pack.

Seeing her struggling, Zoey helped her carry some of the items.

They chatted as they went downstairs.

Zoey added, "After you and Paul ended up at the police station last time, did you tell your parents about Paul abusing you?"

"No." Mentioning this, Lucille's eyes dimmed again. "Sigh, my hometown is in the North, and I married far away. I regretted it so much, wondering why I married far away. It's all fate, I just consider myself unlucky. Besides, my parents didn't even know we got married. After getting the marriage certificate, I told them, and they were furious."

"I even argued with them, insisting I would be happy. Look at me, how long have I been married? And now this happens. How can I face my parents? They knew I married Paul, bought tickets, and flew over to scold me, but it was too late. We were already married. I still remember on the wedding day, my mom cried so much and kept hitting me."

"Although my mom was angry with me, she still cared about me. She told me to come home if I was wronged. They will always be my strongest support. I should really listen to them."

As Lucille said this, tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.

Zoey could tell that Lucille had realized she should listen to her parents. "It's never too late to realize that."

"Well, but I still feel a bit wronged. You know, I'm the only child in my family, and my parents doted on me. But after getting married, Paul beat me and I became his free maid. Thinking about it makes me want to cry. Damn it, I really deserve this."

Zoey comforted her, "Haven't you already figured it out? Realizing it is cutting your losses in time. You still have a long life ahead."

"Yes, you're right. As long as I want to start over, now is the best time." Lucille wiped her tears, looking like a strong girl. "Alright, Officer Brown, I'm fine."

She hailed a taxi and put the cat supplies in the trunk.

After everything was ready, she waved to Zoey through the car window, "Everything's packed, and I've paid, Officer Brown."

Just as the driver was about to leave, Zoey rolled down the window and asked, "By the way, Lucille, you haven't told me your cat's name."

"It's called Big Baby."

Zoey was silent.

She nodded and said goodbye to Lucille.

Zoey watched the cat fall into thought as the car slowly started.

By the time she got home, it was almost midnight.

She thought Robert and Tenley would already be asleep, so she asked the driver to drive quietly to avoid disturbing them.

Unexpectedly, as soon as the car stopped, she saw Robert and Tenley standing at the entrance, seemingly waiting for her.

Zoey opened the car door and got out. Tenley looked around and asked, "Zoey, where's the cat?"

"Here." Zoey handed over the pet carrier next to her.

Tenley took it and lifted the white cloth on top, looking at the pet cat inside with great affection. Her loving gaze didn't seem fake.

"So cute. Robert, look, a pet cat. Its eyes are like gems." The more Tenley looked, the more she liked it. Robert glanced at it and silently went to the trunk to get the other cat supplies.

After bringing everything upstairs, Tenley placed the cat on the balcony. "We used to keep our cat here. It's been years, so there shouldn't be any scent left. It shouldn't feel threatened and can have a good night's sleep."

Zoey, knowing nothing about pets, changed the subject. "Mrs. Davis, is it okay for it to sleep in the carrier for a night? Won't it suffocate?"

"No, this thing is breathable. This carrier is nice and easy to open. Look, just press here." Tenley pressed a button, and the carrier opened.

The kitten lazily stretched its paws and walked out.

It looked around the environment without any signs of unfamiliarity, strutting around the room as if it owned the place.

Tenley laughed, amused by the kitten. "This little thing is too cute. Zoey, what's its name?"

"It's called Big Baby." Zoey reluctantly said the name.

With Lucille's personality, she could come up with such a name.

"What a nice name, haha, Big Baby." Tenley teased it like a child.

The kitten responded to Tenley's calls with meows.

Even Zoey, who disliked cats, found this kitten quite adorable.

"It is so cute, smart, and lovable." Tenley couldn't get enough of it.

Compared to the kitten, Zoey felt a bit neglected.

Zoey yawned and was about to go to her bedroom to sleep when she saw the kitten suddenly jump off Tenley's lap, looking uneasy.

Tenley missed catching it and grabbed at the air. "Oh no, Big Baby, what are you doing?"

The kitten, not understanding human speech, jumped to the floor and kept meowing, searching for something.

Zoey, suddenly alert, turned and asked with concern, "Mrs. Davis, are you okay?"

"I'm fine. It probably needs to use the restroom." Tenley, clearly experienced with pets, instantly understood the kitten's intention.

She turned to set up a litter box for it.

Smelling the litter, the kitten jumped in and started using it.

After finishing, it even covered its waste with its little paws.

Tenley liked it even more, holding it in her arms and stroking it. "Big Baby, you are so great and know how to use the restroom. Your owner must be amazing to train you so well."

The kitten lay quietly in her arms, looking very content.

###chapter 70

Zoey got more and more annoyed the more she looked at it.

It seemed to be showing off to Zoey, letting out a howl in her direction.

Zoey said coldly, "If you keep disturbing people, I'll tape your mouth shut."

The kitten looked confused.

Tenley laughed heartily, petted it a couple of times, and then put it on the ground.

Zoey was really exhausted and told Tenley briefly that she was going to her bedroom to sleep.

At that moment, Lucille sent her a message, a bit worried: [Did you arrive? Is Big Baby adjusting well?]

To reassure Lucille, she took a video of the kitten's current state and sent it to her: [See? She's lively and energetic.]

There was no sign of anxiety from being temporarily separated from Lucille.

It was particularly carefree, strutting around the room.

Then, Zoey went back to the bedroom.

Zoey didn't know when Tenley went to sleep, but she felt that the living room lights were still on before she fell asleep.

The comfortable bed made Zoey sleep very well through the night.

She woke up naturally the next morning without needing an alarm.

As soon as she left her room, she saw the kitten was also awake, sniffing around this unfamiliar home.

"Zoey, you are awake," Tenley said, having just finished making breakfast in the kitchen. She even made something suitable for the kitten to eat, which looked more appetizing than cat food.

Zoey's breakfast was quickly placed on the table, along with the kitten's.

As she ate, the kitten was eating on the balcony not far from her.

The morning sunlight shone in, and at that moment, it was somewhat healing to see it on the kitten.

Zoey quickly finished her meal and went to work.

Tenley assured her that she would take good care of the kitten.

Zoey thought to herself, 'Whether you take care of it or not has nothing to do with me; I have to work and can't spend with it all the time for 50 dollars.'

The workload at the police station in the morning was almost non-existent.

Zoey organized some files, and the morning passed quickly.

Just as she got off work at noon, Lucille's call came in as if on cue.

As soon as she answered, an extremely angry voice came through. "Paul hit me first, that bastard won't divorce me, and he said if I insist on a divorce, I won't get anything! I'm really fed up, Officer Brown, you deal with cases like this every day, do you know any good lawyers?"

"Calm down first," Zoey said. "See if your situation with Paul meets any of the following criteria: one, bigamy or cohabitation with another person; domestic violence or abuse, abandonment of family members; gambling, drug addiction, and other bad habits that are incorrigible; separation due to emotional discord for more than two years; other situations leading to the breakdown of the marriage."

"Isn't it obvious? Domestic violence! He hit me, and I reported it to the police."

Zoey tried to jog her memory. "Last time, Mr. Williams classified your case as mutual assault, remember? That doesn't count. It only proves you went to the police. And..." Zoey said, "This emotional breakdown must be mutual. As long as Paul shows he likes you and doesn't want a divorce, the court won't rule the marriage as broken."

"Why?" Lucille was speechless.

She was an ordinary person and couldn't think about the law from her perspective.

"Isn't it simple? Because marriage is protected by law," Zoey explained.

"What about me? The law can protect marriage but not me? If I want a divorce now, do I need the consent of the person who abused me? What if he refuses and kills me? What about my parents?"

"Well, if he kills you, Paul would get a few years in prison at most."

"A few years? The law won't let me divorce, and if I die, he only gets a few years?" Lucille was both shocked and filled with resentment. "Murder should be punished by death, why only a few years!"

Zoey added, "Although the law stipulates that domestic violence resulting in death can be punished by death, in real cases, the court usually considers the emotional relationship between the couple and generally classifies it as involuntary manslaughter, meaning the abuser didn't intend to kill the victim."

"What? Then I won't divorce, I'll just go kill him now! Only a few years in prison, and I'll have a beautiful life after I get out!" Lucille rolled up her sleeves, ready to act.

Lucille was clearly just putting on a show to show Zoey her determination to divorce.

But Zoey found her amusing. "Do you know if you kill him, you'll get life imprisonment or the death penalty, and you'll never leave prison?"

"Why?" Lucille was even more confused.

Zoey ignored her emotional face, her cold tone tinged with a bit of sarcasm. "Because it would be premeditated murder. He abused you, and you retaliated and killed him, so it can't be considered involuntary manslaughter. The judge would charge you with intentional homicide."

Lucille was silent for a few seconds, extremely frustrated, and possibly because she had no other options, her tears kept falling. "Officer Brown, why is it so hard for me to get a divorce now? I don't want to continue with Paul, even if we stay together, my heart feels like it's already been killed by him. What's the point? I don't love him anymore. Do you know what it's like for a woman to stay with a man she no longer loves? Just seeing him makes me sick. That kind of disgust comes from deep within, it's uncontrollable, do you understand?"

Zoey met her gaze and responded softly.

Although she had never been married, she felt the same way about Derek.

"What should I do, Officer Brown? Am I going to live like this for the rest of my life?" Lucille cried harder, making Zoey's head hurt.

She tried to calm Lucille down. "You're married, don't you know crying doesn't solve anything? Stop crying, I'll think of a way for you."

"Really? Officer Brown, is there another way?" Lucille wiped her tears, but her sobs didn't lessen.

"First, you can file for divorce, but the court is likely to deny it. Then you can separate from him for a year and file again, and the court will usually grant the divorce in such cases. But the whole process from filing to judgment takes 3-6 months."

It would take about two years for them to get divorced.

Lucille couldn't wait; she couldn't stand another moment with Paul. "Officer Brown, what's the second option? I can't wait that long, it's too long." She just wanted a divorce right away.

###chapter 71

If she doesn't get a divorce, she'll feel uncomfortable everywhere.

In the future, her work will definitely be distracted because of this matter. This marriage must end!

Zoey glanced around and lowered her voice, saying, "The reason Paul doesn't want to divorce you is very simple. He's almost thirty and this is his second marriage. You two don't have any children, and if he divorces you, it's unlikely he'll find a young girl to marry. Of course, there are some young girls as naive as you, but the chances are very low, almost nonexistent."

She paused and continued, "If Paul looks for another marriage, it will definitely be with a woman who has also been divorced. If he's lucky, she won't have children, and they might be able to have a child together in the future. If he's unlucky and she has children, even if they have a child together, his wife and her ex-husband won't be able to cut ties because of the child." All these reasons were due to selfishness.

Men were more rational than women, so they would always think in different directions.

"So, do you think if you were Paul, would you divorce yourself?" Zoey asked.

Lucille thought about it, and everything Zoey said made sense. If she were in Paul's shoes, she might not want a divorce either.

Indeed, from Paul's perspective, he didn't gain any advantage by marrying her. If they divorced, unless she agreed to give up the property, he wouldn't let her go.

But she wasn't willing to give up the property.

The two of them were entangled in this matter, making each other sick.

"So what should I do? Is there no hope for me?"

"Of course there is," Zoey said confidently. "It's simple, really. You just haven't hit him hard enough!"

Lucille didn't understand what she meant and asked, "Can you explain it more clearly?"

"It's simple. Think about why you feel you're being domestically abused," Zoey continued to explain. "Because you think the contact with Paul is heavy, he hit you first, and you were more seriously injured than him, so you feel it's domestic abuse, right?"

"Yes, that's right. My strength is so much less than his, my punches don't hurt him at all!" Lucille said.

Zoey added, "But the law doesn't consider strength. Any of its provisions, at least when viewed in isolation, are completely fair. In other words, it only considers gender equality and doesn't make special provisions for the strength differences between men and women."

She guessed that Lucille might still not understand and added a few more sentences. "Let me put it simply. Suppose you are the one committing domestic abuse, constantly inflicting violence on Paul. But because of the strength difference between men and women, you hit him many times, but it might not be as serious as him hitting you once. And he hit you in self-defense. In this case, would the judge rule that you are committing domestic abuse? Do you think that's reasonable? Do you accept that?"

Lucille was silent, feeling extremely confused about so many questions.

She tentatively replied, "Reasonable?"

"From a moral standpoint, it is reasonable, but from a physiological standpoint, you are more seriously injured. Does that count as excessive self-defense?"

Lucille was getting more and more confused by Zoey's words, feeling that no matter what she did, it didn't seem right.

"Officer Brown, what should I do now?"

Zoey was getting frustrated, "Didn't I just say? In your current marital relationship, even if there is mutual violence, the harm Paul suffers is far less important than his desire to vent his violence. He feels that as long as he can hit you and feel satisfied, your punches are insignificant to him. So you just need to make him suffer more."

Lucille understood this time.

Zoey was telling her to fight violence with violence.

But her strength was limited.

No matter how she thought about it, Paul had the advantage.

"I can't beat Paul!" If she could beat Paul, would she need to call the police and ask for their help?

Zoey took a deep breath, her tone showing a bit of disdain for Lucille's stupidity. "Strength can't be changed, but can't you think of other ways?"

"For example?" Lucille asked again.

Zoey tried to calm herself down, and after calming down, she said, "Come over when you pick up the cat, and I'll teach you face-to-face."

"Okay."

Paul had nowhere to go, so he was playing games at an internet cafe.

He stayed up all night and was now sleeping at his spot.

Lucille's call vibrated against his waist, and Paul groggily took out his phone without seeing who was calling and answered, "Hello."

There was silence on the other end for a few seconds.

Paul looked at his phone and saw it was Lucille calling.

He thought she was going to talk about the divorce again, so before Lucille could speak, he said directly, "If this is about the divorce, you can hang up now. Lucille, as long as I'm alive, I will never divorce you! If you have the guts, go ahead and sue or call the cop. If not, just endure it!"

Paul expected Lucille to shout back at him, as she always did.

He was ready to retaliate against Lucille.

But this time, Lucille didn't shout. Instead, she calmly said, "I'm not calling about the divorce. I just want to have a good talk with you. We've been together for so long, from dating to marriage, it hasn't been easy." She sighed after saying this.

Paul heard Lucille's softening tone and thought she had finally given in.

He had asked a few married friends about this, and they all told him that women just need to be coaxed. After all, marriage was an important matter, and both marriage and divorce were not that simple.

His friends had told him many bad things about women getting divorced, which made Paul more confident when he heard Lucille's words.

Thinking of this, his tone became gentler, "Lucille, why didn't you do this earlier? Let's give each other a chance. After all, I love you very much. Every couple argues, right? You know how I treated you when we were dating. If I didn't love you, I wouldn't have married you. Hearing you say this makes me really happy. Lucille, I love you very much."

Lucille didn't want to hear his pretentious words anymore. It was always the same lines.

Lucille felt disgusted, "Okay, come back early. Be home by eight tonight, I'll be waiting for you."

Paul hung up, satisfied, "I'll be back soon."

As soon as he hung up, he took a screenshot of the call log and posted it in the group chat: [Look, Lucille called me first. You guys were right, women are just like that. If you hit them a bit, they become very obedient. You should have heard how gentle her tone was when she talked to me.]

###chapter 72

The group chat quickly became lively when Paul took the lead to speak.

Friend A: [So, how about it? Did the method I told you work?]

Friend B: [I have told you a long time ago, that women need to be hit sometimes, it makes sense.]

Friend C: [Exactly, and we men are different from women. Women are foolish, a few sweet words can make them happy. Unlike us, you just need to apologize sincerely, hit her again next time, and apologize again. She'll never leave you. Haven't you seen those TV dramas? There's a woman who gets beaten every day, and she can't get used to a day without it, even begging her husband to hit her!]

Friend D: [Haha, are you talking about a porn movie?]

Everyone burst into laughter, and the conversation quickly shifted to another topic, which was about adult men.

After joking with his friends, Paul thanked them earnestly.

He tidied up a bit, left the internet cafe, grabbed some skewers, and brought some food back for Lucille to show his care for her.

This was also his way of apologizing and trying to make amends.

When Paul got home, he found that the messy house he left was now spotless; the house looked brand new, even the sofa covers were washed, and the balcony was full of hanging laundry.

Seeing this, Paul felt quite touched.

"If you had been like this earlier, we wouldn't be arguing every day. We're newlyweds, isn't it better to be sweet and loving every day?" Paul put the food on the table. "Let's live a good life from now on. I apologize for this, it's all my fault. Don't be mad at me anymore. I'll try to control my temper in the future."

Hearing his words, Lucille really wanted to curse out loud!

Remembering Zoey's advice, she held back.

She smiled and sat next to Paul, just looking at him.

Paul didn't say anything more, lightly coughed, and then went to the kitchen to get her some utensils. "I brought this, especially for you, eat up. Look at me, no matter what I do outside, I always think of you when I eat. You won't find anyone better than me if you leave. Lucille, you should be happy."

Hearing that, Lucille just wanted to sneer. How did she not notice how disgusting Paul was when they were dating?

The smile on her lips faded a little, but not too noticeably. "Thanks, but I've already eaten. Leave it there, I'll eat it if I get hungry later."

Paul nodded and placed the utensils on the food.

He wanted to sit next to Lucille, but as soon as he sat down, Lucille stood up, not even a second apart.

Paul looked at her in surprise. "Didn't you want to have a good talk with me? What does this mean?"

Lucille's smile was calm as she looked at him. "Of course, I want to have a good talk. One last question, do you agree to divorce me?"

Paul's excitement turned into anger and impatience because of this question. "You're still bringing this up?"

Didn't they already agree on the phone?

"I called you back just for this! What will it take for you to agree to divorce me?" Lucille's words were more determined than before.

Paul's face changed instantly, wanting to hit something to vent his anger.

His hand unconsciously clenched at his waist, gritting his teeth. "Don't even think about it! Never in this lifetime! Lucille, you want to leave me, dream on!"

Lucille had already guessed that Paul wouldn't give in so easily.

Lucille mimicked Zoey's way of tilting her head, looking provocative. "I insist on getting a divorce."

"Then try it!" Paul's anger exploded in an instant, and he raised his fist to punch Lucille's annoying face.

This punch landed solidly, leaving no room to dodge.

In the past, Lucille would have dodged, whether she could or not, but this time she didn't move, just waiting for Paul's fist to land solidly on her face.

'You need to make the case look like mutual combat, not one-sided abuse. Provoke him to hit you first, make sure he hits first, and take photos to keep evidence.' Zoey's words echoed in her mind.

Lucille glanced at the camera placed on the teddy bear, feeling satisfied.

Although Paul was angry, seeing Lucille smile after being hit made him feel something was off.

He instinctively stopped. "Why are you smiling?"

"Nothing." Lucille's smile deepened. "If you're so curious, I'll show you." She pretended to be mysterious and reached behind the cushion.

Paul curiously leaned in to look.

Lucille pulled out a pepper spray from the small box hidden behind the cushion, seized the opportunity, and sprayed it twice in Paul's eyes.

Paul screamed, clutching his eyes and squatting down.

His eyes immediately felt a burning sensation, excruciating pain.

"Lucille, you bitch, what did you spray on me!" Paul's eyes couldn't open, and he tried to grab Lucille by feeling, but she dodged easily.

Remembering Zoey's words, Lucille sprayed his eyes several more times with the pepper spray to vent her anger.

Paul kept clutching his eyes, most of the liquid spraying onto his hands.

But that didn't matter.

The close-range spray was enough to make him suffer.

Seeing Paul completely lose his ability to move, Lucille was satisfied and put the pepper spray back in her pocket.

Then, she pulled out a black sack from under the sofa and put it over Paul's head.

"What is this?" Paul couldn't see but felt something covering him. He struggled and shouted, "You must be crazy! Lucille! Wait till I get better, I'll kill you! Let me go!"

The more Paul cursed, the tighter Lucille tied the sack.

She watched Paul wobble like a top, then kicked his dick with almost all her strength.

Accompanied by Paul's scream, he curled up on the ground.

Tears were about to fall, but he was helpless.

He instinctively curled up to protect his dick, breathing heavily.

He couldn't even curse anymore.

When he got better, he would definitely kill this crazy woman Lucille!

Listening to Paul's wails, Lucille felt her mood lighten.

How did he hit her before? She was giving it all back now.

###chapter 73

She used to be so foolish and stubborn. No matter how hard Paul hit her, he wanted an apology from her, but she just wouldn't say it.

Every time, it was Paul himself who was afraid he might hit her too hard and kill her so that he would stop.

Thinking of this, Lucille kicked him several more times.

Paul was no longer as arrogant as before. Besides his wailing, he didn't utter another word.

'I never thought you'd have a day like this!' Lucille cursed silently in her heart.

She remembered Zoey's advice, not to hit Paul in just one place.

Taking advantage of Paul's inability to get up, she kicked him in other areas.

Each kick was filled with intense hatred, making Paul's wails even louder. "It hurts so much, Lucille, please let me go, don't hit me anymore. I won't hit you again, okay? I'm begging you, it hurts too much, I feel like my dick is going numb, can you help me, I need to go to the hospital."

When she hit his dick, she did use a bit of force. Since she couldn't hit that area anymore, she switched to his butt. Then Lucille kicked his butt twice more.

Seeing Paul completely powerless to fight back, she felt great.

It turned out that hitting this despicable man Paul felt so good.

Emotionally exhausted from hitting him, Lucille walked over to the water dispenser, got a cup of water, and considered continuing to discuss the divorce with Paul.

Unexpectedly, before she could drink the water, the doorbell rang.

Paul heard the sound and, regardless of whether anyone outside could hear him, shouted with all his might, "Help! Police, save me! She's going to kill me!"

Lucille was silent, realizing Paul was truly shameless.

She glanced around the coffee table but didn't find Paul's phone.

It seemed that while she was hitting him, he had secretly called the police.

Paul was really a coward, calling the police so quickly!

Lucille kicked him twice more before going to open the door.

Outside the door stood two police officers, a man and a woman. The man was John, who had handled their case a while ago, and the woman was someone she didn't recognize, not Zoey.

"Mr. Williams, it's you." Lucille blinked her innocent eyes, pretending to be surprised. "I didn't call the cop."

Emma glanced at Lucille, then compared the address in her hand with the current address.

She spoke in confusion, "Mr. Williams, is it here? The address shows this place."

John naturally recognized Lucille. He thought it was Lucille who called the police.

But the information on the phone showed it was from here.

Out of professional consideration, John asked, "Ms. Morgan, your phone number."

Lucille fluently recited her phone number.

Emma looked at the phone number on the report again. "It's not the same number. Did they give us the wrong information? How could they mess up such important information? I can't believe it..." Emma's complaint was interrupted.

A male voice came from inside the room, "Help! I'm here! If you don't save me, I'm going to die. It's me, the person you need to save is me."

The space was not that big, so it was easy for John and Emma not to hear it.

Lucille couldn't hide it anymore and cooperatively invited them in, "Oh, I just remembered, my husband Paul is here too. Maybe he called." She said this as calmly and naturally as if she were talking about the weather.

Emma, full of confusion, followed her into the room. John was even more puzzled!

He had dealt with them before; they were just a young couple who wouldn't give in to each other.

John didn't think much of it, assuming the stubborn couple had fought again.

He followed Emma into the room, and when they stopped, they exchanged glances and were silent for several seconds.

They saw Paul, wrapped in a sack, with his legs feebly flailing.

"Help me, let me go!" Paul's voice came out, and he wriggled a bit.

Emma was startled by him and instinctively took a step back. "What the heck!"

John's gaze returned to Lucille. "Ms. Morgan, what happened?" The last time he resolved their dispute, it hadn't come to this.

How, in just a few days, did the roles of abuser and victim seem to switch?

After asking, he squatted down to untie the sack from Paul, revealing Paul's face, who was cursing and gritting his teeth, looking like he wanted to kill Lucille. "Fuck, you bitch! You've really grown some guts! Now you dare to use tricks on me! If I hadn't called the cop, would you have beaten me to death? Huh? Don't think you're the only one who can call the cop. This time I won't reconcile with you, I'll make sure you go to jail! Just wait!"

Lucille, having been briefed by Zoey in advance, found Paul's words laughable and not threatening at all.

Paul cautiously got up from the ground, his movements stiff and slow, his dick still in pain, making him afraid to move.

A pained expression covered his face, and he hissed, just in time to see John, who had mediated last time. "Yes, it's you! Last time you locked her up. This time you should lock her up, right? You have to stand up for me, don't say there's no evidence or anything! Hurry up and lock her up! Lock her up for a few more days! I absolutely won't reconcile!"

Lucille looked at Paul as if he were a monkey in a circus, wondering how she ever fell for him.

Was she crazy before, running so far to marry him, that it was ridiculous?

John first noticed Paul's bloodshot eyes and some other injuries, but none were bleeding and didn't look too serious.

"Tell me what happened," He said, signaling Emma to start taking notes.

Emma immediately took out a recorder, pressed the record button, and signaled Paul to begin.

Seeing someone standing up for him, Paul immediately changed.

He was a completely different person from the one who had been begging Lucille like a clown earlier.

"It was her! She took advantage of my not paying attention and sprayed something like pepper spray in my eyes. Then, while I couldn't see, she put a sack over me and started beating and kicking me. The most unforgivable thing is, she kicked my dick hard! My family is counting on me to have kids, if something happens to me, can she take responsibility for that?"

"Fuck!" Emma couldn't help but compare Lucille to Ruby in her mind upon hearing Lucille's actions.

###chapter 74

Similarly, both experienced domestic violence from men.

Why was there such a big difference in Ruby and Lucille's reactions?

Although her position as a police officer didn't allow her to praise a suspect, she had already given Lucille a mental thumbs-up.

They couldn't always back down; this was true gender equality!

"Domestic violence?" Lucille sneered at Paul's testimony. "Come on, Paul, how can this be domestic violence? Weren't we just fighting each other?"

She calmly walked behind the teddy bear, took out the surveillance device she had placed there in advance, and transferred all the content to her phone.

Then she found the uploaded video on her phone and showed it to John.

Paul suddenly realized why Lucille laughed after being hit, and he was terrified.

He didn't dare to speak for a moment. His first reaction was to scrutinize Lucille carefully. Seeing that the swelling on her cheek from his slap was gone, he felt relieved.

"Yes." John finished watching the video on the phone, which clearly recorded everything that had happened between the two, including their words and actions.

"It was mutual fighting, not domestic violence." John gave his opinion.

Hearing this, Paul was not having it. "No! How can you say that? I just slapped her once, but look at what she did to me! She kicked my dick and kept kicking me. She was clearly trying to kill me! If you had come a little later, I would be dead! How can this be mutual fighting?"

He couldn't just let this go!

Emma, who had been silent, finally understood, "Are you serious? How much strength can a woman like her have? She hit you a few times, and you're already crying out? I don't see any injuries on you. Are you trying to cause trouble? We handle things according to the law. If you're not satisfied, you can appeal! Mr. Williams said this is a family dispute, so it's a family dispute. Do you understand?"

Paul was so angry that he almost ground his molars to pieces.

He glared at Lucille with furious eyes, but accidentally caught her provocative and smug smile.

In an instant, the anger in his heart surged uncontrollably.

He felt nothing else, only one thought in his mind. 'Lucille, you must die.' 

Paul lunged forward and grabbed her throat, squeezing tightly. "Die, you bitch!"

Lucille didn't move or resist at all.

Just as Paul pinned her against the wall, John threw him to the ground with a shoulder throw.

Then he restrained Paul's arms with great force, making Paul scream in pain.

"Trying to kill someone in front of the police?" John easily subdued him.

Unable to fight back, Paul could only curse Lucille. "You bitch, marrying you was the worst thing that happened to our family!"

Seeing that Paul continued to spew filthy words, John increased the pressure, trying to make him shut up.

He was about to ask Lucille how to handle this when Emma shouted, "Mr. Williams, he's bleeding!"

John frowned slightly and released Paul. He saw that the bleeding was coming from Paul's crotch.

Remembering Paul's earlier complaint about Lucille kicking his dick, he and Emma exchanged glances, stunned for a few seconds.

But Paul was already numb with pain, feeling nothing below. Seeing their horrified expressions, he slowly looked down.

He was completely unsure of the condition of his dick and was already losing his mind.

Paul's eyes were filled with a mix of anger and fear, and his whole body trembled, "My, my dick, my family is counting on me to have children. I... Mr. Williams, save me."

Seeing this, John immediately dialed the emergency number.

After giving the address, he turned and instructed, "Don't move! What if the wound expands?"

Paul was too scared to move anymore. His movements were very slight.

As a man, John fully understood Paul's mindset at this moment. Looking at the blood on the ground and the bleeding area, he sighed helplessly.

He turned and struggled to lift Paul. "Emma, let's go!"

They couldn't wait for the emergency team on the spot.

It would take some time for the emergency personnel to arrive.

At least getting downstairs would save some time.

Paul was heavy, and John gritted his teeth to hold on.

Emma slowly came to her senses and followed John.

The three of them hurried away, completely ignoring Lucille, who was watching the drama unfold.

Once they disappeared from that floor, Lucille couldn't hold back anymore and burst into laughter, especially when she saw the blood on the ground, laughing even harder.

She laughed until her stomach hurt, but as she laughed, an indescribable feeling welled up inside her.

She felt an overwhelming urge to cry.

Lucille allowed herself to cry for a while, then called Zoey. "I took revenge as you said, but there was a little accident. I kicked his dick and made him bleed. Is that a problem?"

Zoey, playing with the cat, answered nonchalantly. "As long as he's not dead, it's fine. If they ask you anything else, just insist it wasn't intentional. Remember, it was an accident during your mutual fight."

"Got it!" Lucille etched every word Zoey said into her mind. "I still have the injury report from when he hit me."

"But after this, if he still doesn't want to divorce me, what should I do?"

Zoey put down the cat toy and thought for a moment. "Do you know where Paul works?"

"Of course, I do." They were married; how could they not know each other's workplaces?

"Good. Do you have any of his colleagues' Facebook contacts? If not, find them. If he refuses to divorce, post the videos of him abusing you."

Men were strange creatures. In private, they might not be good people. But in public, they had to pretend to be good people.

All in all, Men were extremely complex creatures. They might joke about a woman's body or looks in private, but publicly, they would condemn someone for insulting another's appearance, deeming it morally wrong.

To put it more bluntly, they might hit their wives, but if others knew they hit their wives, they would find it shameful.

Lucille was surprised.

Listening to Zoey's strategies, she increasingly felt that this didn't seem like something a cop would do.

###chapter 75

If she hadn't met Zoey at the police station, she would definitely ask Zoey to show her police badge now, to see if Zoey was really a cop.

Zoey didn't understand Lucille's silence at all and asked, "Got it?"

"Yes."

The two hung up, and the cat jumped to Zoey's side again, even rubbing against her.

Zoey pushed it away, but it persisted.

Zoey was silent, thinking it was really troublesome.

At this moment, Robert and Tenley came back from grocery shopping. Tenley saw Zoey playing so happily with the cat, and her smile grew even wider.

"Look, Zoey is so loving, she's so good to the big baby," Tenley praised.

Robert echoed, "Yes, don't all girls like little pets?" Actually, he meant, there was no need to praise about that.

Tenley put the groceries in the kitchen and came out to play with the cat.

Zoey glanced at the time, "Tenley, I won't be eating dinner tonight. I've gained a bit of weight recently, so I'm going for a run to lose some."

"Huh?" Tenley had specifically bought her favorite meat, how could she not eat it?

But it was good for young people to run more, considering Robert had mentioned Zoey's skills.

Tenley didn't stop her, "Alright, be safe, and if anything happens, call me or Robert immediately."

"Okay."

During her free time at the police station, as long as she wasn't working overtime, Zoey would insist on running every day.

She just wanted to train her body and become stronger.

The better she was at fighting, the better.

After entering middle school, Zoey often got beaten up. Fiona, Lena, Gordon, and even Derek all believed in using violence to subdue Zoey.

They thought that if a child was disobedient, they should be beaten!

That ignorant method didn't work on her at all.

Her body was in pain, but her soul told her that these people were guilty

She would never submit to guilty people.

Because of her family's lack of love, Zoey was often bullied at school. Boys in middle school developed to be stronger than girls, and no matter how angry she was, she couldn't beat a boy!

From that day on, she vowed to become the toughest girl!

To make up for the strength difference between genders, she started learning so-called 'dirty tricks.' It was the same trick she taught Lucille.

It had to be said, sometimes it worked really well. Didn't it work just as well when Lucille used it on Paul?

The next morning, Lucille received a call from John. He mainly talked to her about Paul's injury report, mentioning things like torn ligaments.

Lucille had already reached the entrance of Paul's company.

Listening to the content of the call, she stopped in her tracks.

Paul's condition was serious, but thanks to timely medical intervention, his dick was still functional.

"Paul has been telling us not to settle and to detain you, but the incident between you two last time wasn't recorded in our police files. This time, since he hit you first, I've classified the case as mutual assault, not domestic violence. But I have to give you a verbal warning, don't let it happen again!"

"Okay, I understand, Mr. Williams." Lucille was overjoyed, thinking to herself how amazing Zoey was.

Luckily, no one messed with her.

If Zoey wanted to commit a crime, wouldn't she be able to do it without getting caught?

"Mr. Williams, you've been busy with my and Paul's matters recently, thank you." Lucille said.

John replied, "No problem, it's my job. If you have any issues, feel free to contact me."

"Okay, thank you." Lucille turned off her phone and looked at Paul's company right in front of her.

She sneered and took the elevator to the twelfth floor.

The receptionist seemed to be a recent college graduate, looking very pretty. Her big eyes sparkled as if they could talk. She smiled warmly at Lucille and greeted her, "Hello, ma'am, do you have an appointment?"

"Hello, Miss. Does Paul work here? I'm his wife."

"Mr. Howard?" The receptionist said, "You're his wife? He works here. Mr. Howard is great, he often buys us coffee."

At home, when Lucille asked him to bring back a cup of coffee after work, he was unwilling.

But at the company, he often bought coffee for his colleagues.

Lucille glanced at her a few times.

No wonder Paul often bought them coffee. She was not only pretty but also spoke gently.

Those long legs, wearing stockings, which man wouldn't be mesmerized?

The receptionist seemed to realize she had said something wrong and quickly explained, "I didn't mean it that way. It's not just Mr. Howard who buys us coffee, many male colleagues do. Please don't misunderstand."

Lucille was about to get a divorce, she didn't care at all about what Paul did with others at the company.

Even if he treated others to a feast, it had nothing to do with her. She wasn't jealous.

Anyone who fell for Paul's sweet talk was just meeting their fate!

Lucille acted generously and gracefully, "It's just a cup of coffee. I understand, colleagues treat each other all the time. Besides, you're so pretty, you wouldn't be interested in Paul. I get it."

She just lacked someone who would be unconditionally good to her.

The receptionist was puzzled.

She just looked at Lucille, not knowing what to say.

Lucille showed indifference, "I came here to get to know you all better. I don't have many friends here since I married in this place. If you don't mind, we can be friends."

"Of course, I don't mind." The receptionist replied.

"Great, let's add each other on Facebook?"

Faced with Lucille's enthusiasm, the receptionist didn't know what to do.

She politely declined Lucille, "We're working now, and you see the cameras around. Our company has a strict policy against employees getting involved in each other's personal lives, so I'm sorry."

Lucille understood, she was afraid of being seen as an informant.

If it were usual, being rejected, she would have turned and left, hoping to see fewer people.

But somehow, Zoey's image popped into her mind.

She couldn't help but think, 'If Zoey were here, what would she do?'

Suddenly, Lucille blurted out, "Oh, I'm also an unfortunate woman. I know what you're worried about. I married here for so-called love, abandoned my parents, and now I'm alone in this place without a friend. Paul hasn't come home for days, and I really don't know what I did wrong, or if the other woman is just too tempting. We're all women, I hope you can understand me."

###chapter 76

Lucille spoke while tears streamed down her face.

She even showed the receptionists her injuries. "See? He did all this."

The receptionists were shocked. From her astonished expression, it was clear that Paul had a pretty good image in the company.

Lucille stifled a laugh and continued to speak pitifully, "Adding you to the mix was indeed my selfishness. I wanted to know if he had any close relationships with any female colleagues. It might have disturbed you, but you wouldn't understand what marriage means to a woman."

Lucille's act became more and more convincing, to the point where she almost believed it herself.

The receptionists couldn't remain indifferent to her words and kindly handed Lucille a tissue. "Mrs. Howard, don't cry."

"Thank you." Lucille used the tissue to wipe away nonexistent tears.

Her pitiful demeanor made people hate Paul even more for what he had done.

The receptionist, who had initially been hesitant, now comforted Lucille and even offered to add her on Facebook. "Mrs. Howard, don't worry. If I find any clues, I'll let you know right away!"

"The mistress is indeed hateful! Domestic violence is even worse! I never thought Mr. Howard could be such a person in real life! I despise men who hit women the most in my life!"

Lucille forced a smile. "Thank you, your words really warm my heart."

"No problem, if you need anything, just let me know!" The receptionist's righteous demeanor made Lucille feel very satisfied.

The receptionists were the most well-informed people in the company.

By telling the receptionist such a secret, it wouldn't take long for Paul's reputation to be ruined. She wouldn't need to lift a finger!

Having taken care of her business, Lucille went to the hospital where Paul was staying.

How could she miss this grand show of him being hospitalized? She had to enjoy it thoroughly, and take this opportunity to force him to divorce!

Taking advantage of Paul's weak or unfavorable situation to further strike him down.

Lucille arrived at the hospital and, following the ward number John had given her, saw a nurse coming out of the ward.

She seized the opportunity, pretended to cry, and grabbed the nurse's hand. "Excuse me, is Paul staying in this ward ?"

The nurse looked at her warily. "You can ask at the nurse's station if you have any questions."

"Nurse, I don't mean any harm." Lucille took out the marriage certificate she had brought and showed it to her. "I just want to know how Paul is doing. I'm so worried about him, but I'm a bit afraid to face him right now."

"You're his wife? He's fine." The nurse pointed to an office ahead. "That's his attending doctor's office. You can go there."

"Okay." Following the nurse's directions, Lucille arrived at Finn Torres's office.

She used the same tearful act on Finn.

Seeing her cry so sadly, Finn spoke up. "Well..." As a doctor, it wasn't appropriate for him to say anything.

But seeing the marriage certificate Lucille provided, they were indeed a married couple.

If he didn't say anything, would that be considered helping to cover up? This was a very private matter, after all.

Telling Lucille shouldn't be a problem, right? After all, Paul's dick was still functional; it wasn't like they were completely useless.

Given their current age, a normal sex life could still be maintained.

"Dr. Torres, please tell me. I can handle any result. I love him and won't mind his physical shortcomings. As Paul's wife, I need to know what's wrong with him in that regard, don't you think?"

"I understand." Finn sighed and organized his thoughts. "I'm not an expert in this area, but in his current condition, having sex three to four times a month is possible. There shouldn't be too many problems."

Hearing that, Lucille was almost laughing inside but had to hold it in.

It wouldn't be good to show it too obviously.

Finn briefly explained the situation to Lucille and then left the office.

Lucille could hardly contain her excitement to see Paul.

She followed the route back and pushed open the door to the ward.

Besides Paul's bed, all the other three beds in the ward were occupied, all by men.

When they saw Lucille come in, they all glanced in her direction, including Paul.

Paul also saw Lucille come in, and his hatred for her surged.

His angry expression looked like he wanted to devour her.

But Lucille fearlessly met his gaze, crying pitifully and acting dramatically. "Honey, do you still have any feeling in your dick? Can you still have sex with me? I just heard the doctor say that it all depends on your recovery, Honey. What am I supposed to do?"

Paul remained silent.

A man's greatest humiliation was having his woman say in front of other men that he had sexual dysfunction.

Lucille was treading dangerously close to Paul's breaking point.

As soon as she said this, all eyes in the ward turned to them.

Paul was about to lose it, gritting his teeth and shouting at Lucille. "If you keep talking, you can try my fist! You're a vicious woman! You did this to me and now you're here to mock me! Didn't the police say it was mutual assault? Just wait, Lucille. You don't need to gloat here. Wait until I recover! I'll fight you to the end!"

"Wow, you scared me. How can you be so arrogant when you have sexual dysfunction?"

Paul was furious.

"Who has sexual dysfunction?"

Lucille blinked her innocent eyes. "That's what Dr. Torres told me. It has nothing to do with me; it's all what Dr. Torres said."

Paul remained silent.

Lucille looked at him lying in bed, still not showing any restraint, and didn't get angry at all.

"Honey, I know you're in a bad mood right now, but it's okay. Even if you can never have sex again, I'll always be by your side." Lucille said, lowering her head pitifully. "But honey, can you promise me one thing? Please don't hit me anymore. Every time you hit me, I worry about your hand, whether it hurts or not."

As soon as Lucille finished speaking, the ward erupted.

Paul had sexual dysfunction, and Lucille was still so understanding. Paul even hit Lucille?

Their expressions of watching the drama instantly turned into looks of disdain, all directed at Paul.

Paul suddenly felt that the Lucille in front of him seemed different, completely unlike the Lucille he used to know. "Don't disgust me! You bitch."

"Honey, so what? Are you willing to divorce me, a disgusting woman?"

Paul sneered, 'Lucille, you are still waiting for me here. Do you want a divorce? Dream on!'

###chapter 77

Lucille had been with Paul for so many years, of course, she knew Paul wouldn't let her go so easily.

She wasn't surprised, nor angry, nor agitated.

Her gaze followed the injured part of his body, and then she let out a sarcastic smile.

"Bitch!" Paul was infuriated by her smile, the more he looked at Lucille's face, the more he wanted to tear her apart.

Just as he was about to sit up, a heart-wrenching pain shot through his lower body.

Paul suddenly thought of a brilliant plan.

Since Lucille could disgust him, he could disgust her too.

He wouldn't divorce her, and after finding someone else and establishing a relationship, he would then abandon Lucille!

He would disgust her and torment her every day.

After all, she was the one who was anxious, not him.

Thinking of this, a smile tugged at the corner of Paul's lips, and his gaze at Lucille became less sharp, more calm, and his furious state instantly returned to normal.

"Honey, you care so much about me, how could I bear to divorce you? If you have the guts, you can go down with me, kill me, and go to jail, otherwise, don't think you can escape from me! Even if you die, you'll be buried with me!" After saying this, he lay back on the bed, humming a tune nonchalantly, looking like he was determined to fight Lucille to the end.

Lucille's nails dug deeply into her flesh, and she thought 'Bad man! How could I have been so blind to fall for someone like Paul back then?'

Paul even wanted to trap her for decades. The way he was now was like a different person from when they were together a few years ago. When he liked her, he was the most gentle and understanding man in the world.

He thought of everything thoroughly.

He thought of almost everything more comprehensively than she did, no matter what happened, he would shield her from the wind and rain.

But now, Every argument was relentless. Every time they pointed at each other and cursed each other's parents.

Lucille couldn't even think about it anymore, tears welled up in her eyes, and the pain seemed to corrode her insides.

It turned out that time could really change a person or a relationship.

Lucille suppressed her urge to cry, sniffed, and gave Paul a somewhat sweet smile. "Honey, If you don't want a divorce, then we won't divorce. You know, we've known each other for so long, and I suddenly realized that I don't even know your colleagues. Since we're going to live well together in the future, let's do it right. You should bring your colleagues home for dinner sometime, so I can get to know them and feel a bit more secure."

"Security? You're married to me and you still feel insecure? Hmm?" Now, every word Lucille said seemed premeditated to Paul.

She was saying this now just to threaten him into divorcing her.

"Do you want to meet my colleagues to spread our family issues to the company? Do you think you're not embarrassing enough? Hmm?"

"Embarrassing?" Lucille almost wanted to laugh, but she held back."

Paul's public image, once disguised, had to be maintained to the end.

Lucille added, "I married you far away for so-called true love, don't listen to my parents, lives alone in your familiar city, not only don't get your love but instead gets beaten and kicked by you. Wow, thinking about it, I am indeed very embarrassed."

"And oh." Lucille's gaze fell on his dick again. "Oh, right, are you afraid of your sexual dysfunction being exposed?"

Paul was furious.

He angrily got up from the bed, yanked out the needle from the back of his hand, and pointed at Lucille, cursing. "Try it! If you dare to spread this about me, I'll drag you down with me even if I die! Bitch!"

Paul was really angry, veins bulging on his face.

The whole ward echoed with his unpleasant roars.

The few people nearby didn't try to intervene, cautiously looking in their direction, as if watching a show.

Lucille remembered Zoey's advice, looking at Paul going crazy without changing her expression.

Paul cursed for a while and got tired, no one responded to him, and he got even angrier after venting his emotions alone.

But Lucille didn't respond to him at all, and he gradually calmed down.

They had lived together for so many years, Lucille wasn't the kind of woman who would exploit others' weaknesses, she just wanted to use this to threaten him into divorcing her.

If he fell for it now, there would be no way out. He must not lose his composure.

The most important thing was, that even if Lucille wanted to spread it, she would have to bear the responsibility for slandering someone's privacy.

Lucille, was a divorced woman with a criminal record. Wouldn't it be even harder for her to find a marriage partner in the future?

What he could think of, Lucille must have thought of too.

Paul thought he was so smart, and Lucille was no match for him at all.

He lay back on the bed, as if nothing had happened. "But if you want to go, go ahead, I won't stop you." Lucille didn't even know his company, did she think she could go to the police station to check his records?

Lucille was just waiting for him to say this.

After recording, she took out her phone, looked at it, and mentioned the name of the receptionist, Janna Day, on Facebook.

Paul felt a bad premonition hearing this familiar Facebook name.

"How, how did you know Janna's Facebook account?" He suddenly sat up, surprised.

"Isn't it to better understand you, my dear? Before I came, I even went to your company, and the girls there were so enthusiastic. Knowing I was your wife, they all added me on Facebook."

Paul comforted himself, thinking it didn't matter that they added her on Facebook. Who would get involved in someone else's marital issues? Everyone had their own problems.

Paul sneered. "So what? Do you think others will get involved in our family issues? How stupid."

Lucille guessed Paul was shameless, but she didn't expect him to be stupid too.

"You're right, no one would get involved in someone else's issues, but our human has the ability to empathize, just like how watching a movie evokes similar feelings in about seventy to eighty percent of people," Lucille explained, then chuckled. "Do you think a girl seeing me being abused would empathize with me?"

Saying this, she sent all the evidence in her hand to Paul.

Paul glanced at the photos on the phone, all showing the injuries on Lucille's body from his beatings.

Paul's hand trembled involuntarily, and he wondered why Lucille had become like this.

Not only were there previous abuse photos, but also a video from last night, a full version.

###chapter 78

Paul's face turned pale, his lips trembling, his body shaking, as if his whole being was in sync with his violently beating heart.

Lucille squinted her eyes, calmly watching the myriad of expressions on his face, and she felt a bit satisfied.

Paul didn't speak for a long time, seemingly deep in thought.

But Lucille didn't want to wait any longer and decided to take the opportunity to finish what she had to say. "You should be clear about my determination to divorce you by now. If you still want to drag this out with me, that's fine, I don't mind spending a few days in jail. Those videos you're afraid of, I'll make sure all your relatives, friends, family, and colleagues see them!"

"Also, I have videos of you hitting me, and I will sue for divorce! Whether you agree or not, I am definitely not going back to that house. I will go back to my own home. If you still don't agree, we'll separate! After a year of separation, the law will determine that our marriage is irreparably broken. If you like dragging this out, we can drag it out. I'm not in a hurry. After all, a year goes by quickly, and I can achieve the result I want, while your reputation will be ruined, and it will be hard for you to find a wife in this town!"

"Of course, I don't like to be so ruthless. If you agree to divorce me now, I will delete all the evidence and videos you're afraid of! Think about it."

For the first time, Paul felt that Lucille was serious this time.

The bad advice his friends had given him before had undoubtedly driven his marriage further away.

He seemed to be really losing Lucille, who was so cold and distant in front of him.

Paul's voice suddenly softened, calling her name, "Lucille."

Lucille calmly looked at the unwillingness in Paul's eyes, mixed with a complexity she couldn't understand.

"Do we really have to come to this? Do you know that in our hometown, divorce is a very, very shameful thing? How will my parents face others in the village?"

"It's none of my business." She was about to divorce him, so these things were no longer within her jurisdiction.

"Lucille, can you really be so heartless to me? Why? We've been together for so many years, don't you have any fond memories of me? Do you only remember the bad things when we argue? Do you remember the good things? Those efforts weren't fake, right?" Paul said, "You're almost thirty, with such a bad temper and an ordinary appearance. If you divorce me, are you sure the next person will be better than me?"

Lucille felt a bit soft-hearted when she heard the first half of his words.

After all, they had been together for so many years.

But when she heard the second half, she laughed completely.

"You have time to pick on me here, why don't you think more about yourself? Look at yourself, I'm more than good enough for you. I really find it interesting, if I'm so ordinary and bad in your eyes, why are you with me? Why did you marry me? Oh, I get it, it's because you couldn't find anyone better than me, right? I was fooled by you, working as a free maid for your family for so many years. Didn't get any money, and had to be beaten by you every day. You must not have recognized your place, do you know how hard it is for someone like you to find a partner?"

"My efforts in the past few years, I'll just consider myself stupid, I admit I was at a loss, but fortunately, I'm awake now, I don't accept my fate, and I don't want to waste my precious time entangling with you for the rest of my life!"

Paul was silent.

He was stunned for a moment, suddenly not knowing what to say. Why was it different from what his friends had told him?

Lucille continued, "And who says women have to get married? Is it illegal not to get married? These days of cold war with you, I've been living so freely alone, not having to clean up after you, a bad man. You, just live with your pile of garbage in the future!"

Paul was silent.

Lucille became more aggressive, her calmness gone. "Divorce, or not!"

Paul looked at the fierce Lucille, and with people around watching the drama, if he didn't agree to the divorce, he would really lose all face.

"Divorce! We'll divorce when I get out of the hospital!"

Lucille got the answer she wanted and recorded his agreement to the divorce to prevent Paul from changing his mind.

Just as she was about to leave the ward, Paul called out to her again.

"What else?" Lucille turned back impatiently.

"Nothing, just that since we're getting divorced, we'll be strangers from now on! You have to return the salary I earned these months while staying with you! And pay my medical bills!"

Lucille thought, 'What a jerk.'

"Fine!" She agreed readily and went to pay the hospital bill.

To prevent him from changing his mind, she didn't say more and left the hospital.

Paul was finally going to divorce her. What awaited her was a brand new and free life.

Somehow, even though the sky was the same, she felt it was so vast at this moment.

It turned out that when you decide to start over. Everything around you becomes so new.

She thought of Zoey's words. 'As long as you want to start, it's never too late. Yes, my life is just beginning.'

Zoey hadn't replied much to Lucille's messages these days.

But she had seen all of Lucille's messages and was glad that she could start anew, choosing her future life.

She was too busy, as she was about to transfer from the police station to the criminal investigation department, so she didn't have time to ask Lucille.

The next day, just as she started work and hadn't even warmed her seat, she received a call from Lucille. "Officer Brown, I finally got divorced!"

Zoey wasn't surprised. If Lucille were a fool, she wouldn't have stayed in touch with her.

"Congratulations, Lucille!"

"I couldn't have gotten divorced so smoothly without your help!" Lucille flattered her and quickly said, "By the way, Officer Brown, I noticed you haven't replied much to my messages these days. When are you free? I'll treat you to a meal! Also, Big Baby might need to stay with you for a few more days. Once I sort out the housing issue, I'll come to pick it up."

"I've been a bit busy lately, too busy to eat. Let's talk when I'm not busy." Zoey subtly declined her, then changed the subject, "Are you planning to go back to your parents' place after the divorce?"

"I've developed quite well here in the past few years. If I go back, there's nothing much to do. I plan to stay. I can't give up my good job just because I didn't find a good husband. That would be losing a lot, wouldn't it?"

"What about your parents?"

Lucille replied, "I'm thinking, Officer Brown, once I save up for a down payment on a house, I'll bring them over."

"That sounds good."

Lucille smiled, "Yes, I've planned my future well. Officer Brown, if you're busy, we can arrange another time. I have to get busy now too. Wait for my call."

Then she hung up.

###chapter 79

Zoey didn't take it seriously, so she put her phone back in her pocket and continued to lean on the bench in the hallway, squinting her eyes.

Emma came over at this moment, "Who just called you?"

People were coming and going in front of them, and the footsteps were particularly heavy.

The noise made it impossible for Zoey to sleep well.

The emergency room light was still on, and they had no idea what was going on inside.

A little girl, Ruby's daughter, was sleeping on their laps.

In the morning, they received a call from Ruby, saying that the breakfast she made didn't suit her husband's taste. Her husband threw the freshly cooked food at her, and while trying to avoid the hot food, she accidentally hit her head on the coffee table. Blood started flowing uncontrollably.

Her husband, realizing he was in trouble, immediately ran away.

It was Ruby's daughter who took Ruby's phone and called Emma, then called for an ambulance. Since John wasn't around, Zoey accompanied her.

"Lucille called to tell me she divorced Paul," Zoey said indifferently.

"Wow!" Emma seemed more excited than Lucille, "The first time I met Lucille, I thought she was so cool! Women shouldn't be bound by outdated ideas. Really, it would have been better if Lucille had figured it out sooner! I'm thrilled just hearing about it."

"What's there to be thrilled about?" Zoey lazily glanced at her, "Lucille is just a relatively clear-headed normal person. And Ruby, who's being resuscitated in there, is not normal. If Lucille were not normal, her fate would be the same as Ruby's. That's why the slogans always say that domestic violence happens either zero times or countless times. They just don't listen and think they're so great for enduring it for the sake of their children. Actually, all that suffering is their own doing."

Emma knew Zoey was disappointed in Ruby, but she couldn't fully agree with Zoey.

Looking at the girl sleeping on her lap, she softly said, "Well, there's nothing we can do. She's just a pitiful person."

Zoey's tone was even colder than before, "I don't deny that she was once a pitiful person. But when things happened, she had the ability to change but didn't want to. After that, everything that happened to her, in my opinion, is not worth sympathizing with."

Ruby was perfectly fine, not disabled, and didn't need anyone to take care of her. She was still young, with a daughter. Why couldn't she live?

Although it would be tough, it was better than being beaten every day and constantly hospitalized. A bad environment would only create a bad influence on the child.

Zoey found it laughable, "No one can save her, and you shouldn't waste your efforts. Don't try to be a good person; you'll get tired and frustrated after helping her five or six times."

Emma moved her lips, wanting to say something.

A doctor came out of the emergency room and called at the door, "Who's Ruby's family?"

Emma immediately raised her hand, "Here, doctor, Ruby's daughter is here."

The doctor glanced at Emma, "I mean an adult. Where's her husband?"

"Her husband ran away. We brought her here after receiving the report," Emma slowly moved the girl's head and got up to the doctor's side. She also showed her police badge.

The doctor roughly understood and reminded me, "Be prepared mentally. She has a large amount of cerebral hemorrhage, causing compression symptoms, leading to acute intracranial pressure increase and brain herniation, which is life-threatening."

Emma was stunned, "Is it that serious?"

"So try to contact her family first."

"Okay, I'll do it right away!" Emma didn't dare to delay such a life-threatening matter.

She called the police station and quickly found out Ruby's parents' address, asking someone from the station to contact them.

After finishing everything, she returned to her seat.

The little girl blinked her sleepy eyes and asked, "Officer Thomas, when can I go in to see my mom?"

Emma swallowed hard, trying to comfort her, "She'll wake up soon." Then she turned her gaze to Zoey, "I've notified them. Her parents are in the neighboring city and are on their way."

"Okay." Zoey's Facebook notification just went off. She glanced at it, "Mr. Williams said he's here. I'll leave now. I haven't finished my case from yesterday."

Emma responded and started comforting Ruby's daughter.

Zoey noticed the tears Emma was holding back and slowly said, "No matter what happens to Ruby, I suggest letting her parents take the child. If they can't afford to raise her, Mr. Williams can set up a charity fund for them."

This way, the girl could escape her father's clutches, and grow up in a relatively healthy environment.

Emma might not have heard her, but still patiently comforting the girl, "Don't worry, your grandparents will be here soon. Are you happy?"

The little girl kept crying, her eyes red, "I just want my mom."

Zoey greeted John at the hospital entrance and returned to the Riverside Police Department.

She finished all her work and went to handle her resignation procedures. Since hers was more complicated, she had to go through several departments to complete it.

Then, she finally had time to pack her desk.

Around six in the evening, Emma and John returned.

John saw Zoey's clean and tidy desk and felt a bit reluctant. They hadn't interacted much, but Zoey had left a deep impression on him several times.

He used to get a headache at the mention of Zoey.

Now that she was leaving, he felt a bit sad. It was a strange feeling.

"Leaving today?" John asked.

"Yes, I've completed the resignation procedures." Zoey said, standing up seriously and bowing to John, "Thank you, Mr. Williams, for your guidance these days. No matter where I go in the future, I won't let you down."

John smiled, "I never really guided you much. When you first came to the Riverside Police Department, I thought you weren't fit to be a cop. Honestly, I was always thinking of reasons to transfer you to another department until you solved Ella's case. Then I thought you were perfect for being a detective. Your thinking is comprehensive and well-founded. Officer Davis from the detective team has praised you more than once. You should do well there!"

"Don't worry, Mr. Williams, I will," Zoey replied.

Zoey was still his student, so John gave her a few more words of advice before leaving her side.

Emma returned to her desk, her eyes never leaving Zoey, feeling very complicated, "The detective team is so exhausting. If there's no case, it's fine, but if there is, you'll be on call all the time. It's not as comfortable as our police station."

###chapter 80

"If you had gone, you wouldn't be as carefree as you are now. Plus, dealing with a body disposal case, not only is it difficult, but the pay is also low. It's basically doing dirty and tiring work for the least amount of money." Emma added.

Zoey replied. "That's still better than dealing with these stupid things. I'd rather stay up late and use my brain than explain things to these clueless people every day."

"You're right about that." Emma had also grown tired of handling civil disputes lately.

Every day it was trivial matters, taking up two-thirds of her work time.

Some older people were even more stubborn; they couldn't be reasoned with.

"I heard from my classmates back in school that you were quite annoying. After working with you for so long, I found out you really are annoying."

Zoey smiled slightly. "It's fine now, I'm just about to leave."

Emma was silent; that wasn't what she meant.

She quickly stood up and called out to Zoey. "Can you let me finish speaking? I think you're a bit different from how they described you. That adjective is obviously exaggerated. Although you can be annoying sometimes, I don't dislike you that much."

"Well, whether you like me or not, what does it have to do with me?"

"Aren't we friends?"

"Are we?"

Emma was silent.

"What do you mean, Zoey!" Emma was very angry. "Aren't we friends? If we weren't friends, why would you talk to me so much? Why would you teach me how to handle civil disputes? If we weren't friends, why would you accompany me to Ruby's when I was at a loss?"

Faced with Emma's accusations, Zoey was a bit surprised.

She was nice to Emma because Emma gave her money. And handling Ruby's matter was just work.

Zoey looked at Emma's expression and knew Emma was reluctant to see her go. She just had a strong personality when speaking. From the Ruby incident, it was clear she was a kind-hearted girl.

As for Emma, well, she didn't dislike her.

"Just kidding, we are friends." Zoey was afraid Emma would really cry and she wouldn't know how to handle it.

Hearing this, Emma held back her tears. "Hmph! That's more like it."

Zoey was amused by Emma's proud yet reluctant expression.

Emma brought up Ruby again. "By the way, Ruby..."

"There's no need to talk about Ruby. She brought it on herself. I don't want to waste my precious life listening to her nonsense."

Emma responded. "Then let's not talk about her. But Ruby's parents seem to love their granddaughter very much. They took the child away. I hope she will be happy in the future."

"That's good." Just as Zoey finished speaking, she received a message from Robert saying they were already outside.

Emma reluctantly saw her to the door. "When you're not busy, you can call me, and we can go shopping or have coffee together. Don't act cold. If I text you and you don't reply, I'll come to the detective bureau! You won't be able to work properly."

Zoey didn't say anything, silently moving her things.

Emma tugged at her sleeve, pouting. "I hate goodbyes."

"It's not like we won't see each other again."

"That's true, but if we're both busy, especially you, when will we have time to get together?" Emma sighed deeply, then suddenly leaned close to Zoey and said. "I heard there are a lot of handsome guys in the detective team. Help me pick a few. I like the ones who look really strong."

"OK."

Zoey didn't have many things, and it didn't take long to move them all.

Robert's trunk was just the right size.

Zoey hugged Emma goodbye and got into Robert's car, officially becoming a member of the first detective team.

She had been here before as an intern, so she wasn't too nervous about starting the job since she was already familiar with it.

Following Robert, she smoothly arrived at their detective team's office.

As soon as she opened the door, she saw Alexander and the others holding a banner, each holding a corner, looking somewhat comical.

It read: [Welcome the Excellent Ms. Brown to the First Detective Team.]

Seeing that, Zoey was silent.

Was she sure she was joining the first detective team?

Charles immediately handed her a bouquet of flowers. She didn't know the name of the flowers, but they smelled particularly fragrant.

"Welcome, Zoey, to the first detective team."

"Thank you." The flowers hadn't even warmed up in her arms before Charles took them back. "There's a vase over there. I'll put them in for you."

Zoey noticed that the desks had been rearranged, and her spot was by the window, looking very bright, spacious, and clean.

She immediately liked her new office environment.

Robert pointed to her spot and patted her shoulder. "Work hard, and aim to get promoted with Alexander."

Alexander smiled gently at Zoey and responded to Robert. "Luckily, there are two promotion spots. Otherwise, with Zoey's excellence, I wouldn't stand a chance."

Zoey glanced at him. "As long as you know."

Alexander was silent; he had brought this on himself.

He could never win an argument with Zoey, but he just wanted to tease her.

Zoey placed her things on her desk and quickly organized them.

She didn't give Alexander a single glance.

The first few days of work were almost uneventful, not busy at all, just sorting through old case files with Alexander and explaining them to the newcomers. So they left work on time every day.

Lucille, after sorting out the house, also took her cat away.

Tenley, back home, often sighed when looking at the places the cat used to stay. Robert told Zoey. "See, she wants to get a pet again."

Pets could be a source of emotional support; it was very healing.

Zoey guessed that maybe because Kelvin had been away from them for too long, Tenley used pets to ease her longing.

"When we have a break, let's get her a pet to cheer her up." Just as she finished speaking, Robert received an order to go on a business trip.

"Willowbrook Village? Where is it? Is it in our area? I've never heard of it." Dennis muttered.

Charles immediately opened the web and searched for Willowbrook Village. Information about it quickly popped up. "It's in Suncrest City. How remote!"

"Suncrest City?" Dennis knew the place; it was far from their area. "Why is the higher-up sending Officer Davis there? What does it have to do with him? Is it some kind of team-building event?"

###chapter 81

"Dream it, all you know is playing around." Robert seriously handed out the files to a few people, "No matter how this case ended up with us, since it's ours now, we have to go! The bureau has given our team two cars, everyone pauses your work, go home and pack up, and meet at 8 o'clock sharp!"

"Yes, Officer Davis!"

Zoey heard that they were going along too.

She immediately closed her notebook where she was writing a novel.

"Officer Davis, let's go home quickly then!" Zoey said.

"I've already asked Tenley to help you pack your luggage. I still need to get the approval documents and materials. Alexander, can you help me pick them up? I'll get you a cab."

"I have everything prepared in advance, I'll take Zoey over," Alexander said.

Zoey agreed readily, "Okay, I'll ride with him."

Alexander gave her a free ride, saving her money.

Alexander made a call home, instructing them on the clothes he needed to bring.

After passing through the neighborhood with Zoey, the housekeeper in cleaning clothes respectfully handed over the luggage. "Mr. Edwards, I'll put it in the trunk for you."

Alexander responded and opened the trunk.

The housekeeper placed the suitcase inside, closed the trunk, started the engine, and drove off.

Zoey sat in the passenger seat, glanced around the neighborhood, and saw the name of the community.

Out of curiosity, she searched it up.

When she saw the price, she marveled at the huge gap between people.

The person driving her was Alexander, an heir from a wealthy family. She couldn't help but wish he could experience some hardships in life.

But Alexander didn't notice her resentment towards the rich at all.

Alexander turned his head and smiled at her, "Zoey, you can take a nap. If you don't want to sleep, you can chat with me."

Zoey didn't even respond, turned her head,d and lay on the seat, facing away from him.

She refused to chat with a rich person.

A few people packed some lunch boxes in the detective team's cafeteria and bought some snacks and water from the nearby supermarket.

The first detective team set off towards Suncrest City!

Robert, Zoey, and Alexander were in one car.

Charles and Dennis were in another.

It took about seven to eight hours to drive from the city bureau to Suncrest City, not counting the rest time, it was a relatively long journey.

Zoey couldn't drive, she just sat.

The others took turns driving, she was the most comfortable.

Around one in the morning, Robert woke her up, "Eat something, Zoey. It's been a tough journey."

Zoey groggily opened her eyes and found that Robert had already heated up all the lunch boxes. The others had already started eating.

Zoey looked at the dry rice and dishes, with no appetite at all.

After glancing around the service area, she asked, "Do they have grilled sausages?"

"Grilled sausages?" Alexander was silent.

Robert glanced at the supermarket in the service area, there was a machine grilling sausages, and they were rolling on it.

Since Zoey wanted to eat, as the team leader, he couldn't be too stingy, thinking it was a cheap thing anyway.

"Alright, you guys go pick, take as many as you want!" With Robert's permission, Charles was the first to run to the supermarket.

After everyone finished eating, it was too late, so they slept there.

Zoey, being a girl, got the spacious back seat.

Robert and Alexander made do with one lying on the steering wheel and the other reclining on the passenger seat.

Zoey was the most comfortable among them, sleeping until she naturally woke up.

Outside the car window was foggy, and visibility was less than 30 feet.

She yawned, not daring to move too much.

The two in front were sleeping soundly, Zoey didn't disturb them.

She took out her phone to check the time, it was six in the morning. They had driven for several hours last night, it was time to rest well.

So she turned off her phone and continued to sleep for a while.

By eight o'clock, it was much brighter outside, and the fog gradually dissipated.

They ate some bread and the car set off again.

Soon, they arrived at the bustling downtown area from the service area.

"Where are we now? How much longer to the destination?" Robert asked from the passenger seat.

Alexander glanced at the map on his phone, "We've entered Skylake District, another half hour to go."

Robert looked back at Zoey drinking water, "Are you hungry? If you are, let's find a place to have breakfast."

"There should be some local specialties here, right? Let me check." Zoey was particularly proactive when it came to food.

She took out her phone and started searching.

After searching for a long time, she found nothing.

Alexander said, "I've been here before, there's nothing special. What do you want to eat?"

"Anything."

"Okay." Alexander drove to a corner breakfast shop, and they ordered a few sandwiches and started eating.

"I really need to suggest to the organization, can't we take the high-speed train next time? Driving ourselves is exhausting."

"You think I don't want to? But considering Willowbrook Village is too remote, who knows what it's like once we get there? What if there's no place to stay? Do we have to wander around? Isn't that tiring?"

"True." Dennis stopped expressing his opinion and focused on eating.

Robert yawned and told everyone to pack up and continue the journey, "Hurry up, the colleagues at Skylake District police station are waiting for us."

"Okay, finished, Officer Davis!" Dennis packed two more sandwiches for the road.

Zoey thought it would be very close to Willowbrook Village once they reached Skylake District, just a bit farther from the city.

But she was wrong.

At the foot of the mountain, she looked at the uphill road, speechless.

"What? We have to go up the mountain."

Robert asked Alexander to stop and took the driver's seat himself, "I'll drive the mountain road, I'm used to it. You go to the passenger seat."

Alexander responded and switched places with Robert.

The two cars drove through the rugged mountain road, making their stomachs churn, finally seeing a household.

After driving a bit further, more rural houses appeared in sight.

Robert parked the car and curiously looked around. "You guys have good eyesight, help me find the city police car."

They got out and gathered, Charles had the best eyesight, and within seconds he pointed ahead, "I see the city police car!"

Everyone looked in the direction he pointed, it was a police car, but no one was inside.

Charles said, "Is it possible the car couldn't go further? They walked up?"

"That's possible, let's ask the villagers."

"Okay."

###chapter 82

Due to the rain, the ground was a bit damp.

It was still a rural dirt road, and stepping on it would get your shoes muddy.

Dennis's brand-new, clean leather shoes got dirty after just a few steps.

"This place is unbelievable!" He took out a wet wipe from his pocket, intending to clean his shoes, but Robert, beside him, asked, "Do you think your wet wipes will be enough?"

Dennis paused.

Indeed, He didn't know when he would be able to leave after finishing the case, being fussy was useless.

"Got it, Officer Davis." Dennis silently put away his wet wipe, looked at the remote area, and said helplessly, "The government has given a lot of subsidies to various places over the years, why don't they fix the roads? You know, the poorer the place, the less they accept others' opinions. Being poor is not a big deal." He gently patted the stunned Charles, "Do you know what's worse than being poor?"

"What is it?" Charles asked out of courtesy.

"Customs!" Dennis shared many of his personal experiences with Charles.

Because of poverty and lack of education, the villagers had never left the mountains. They only knew how to farm and sell grain, and they wouldn't see a woman all year round, so they started buying wives, which led to human trafficking.

It could be said that without their ignorance, the human trafficking industry wouldn't be so prosperous.

Almost all the buyers found by traffickers were uneducated, authentic rural people from the mountains.

Charles wasn't interested in listening to this; he just wanted to solve the case quickly and leave.

His eyes scanned the surroundings and suddenly noticed something. He immediately reported to Robert, "Officer Davis, there's a crowd over there!"

Zoey's previously uninterested face showed a hint of expectation upon hearing this.

Charles had the best eyesight in their criminal investigation team.

As soon as he spoke, everyone saw a crowd not far ahead, and they could hear them talking, but due to the distance and the local accent, they couldn't understand what was being said.

No wonder they hadn't seen many people since entering the village.

It seemed everyone was watching the commotion.

Seeing the crowd, they quickly walked over. Robert calmly took out his police badge and showed it to the crowd, "Make way, police business."

The surrounding people made way but inexplicably rolled their eyes at Robert.

Seeing their attitude towards the police, Dennis issued a warning.

The villagers of Willowbrook Village then made a wider path for them.

Only then did they squeeze to the front of the crowd.

Before they entered, Zoey heard some information from the villagers.

"What's there to pity? They deserved it!"

"I think one of them was about to get married, right?"

"Bringing shame to Willowbrook Village!"

The building in front of them was so dilapidated that the yellow earth inside was exposed, and the walls looked broken and collapsed after years of weathering.

However, compared to ordinary houses, it was quite large. It was a place similar to a church, and the main door was covered in dust.

Beyond the door was an open space, not very large, with a dried-up pool. It was called a pool, but there was no water in it, and it looked abandoned for a long time.

They passed the pool and reached the main hall.

There were two small rooms on the side, and that was the entire structure.

Charles glanced back at the dense crowd at the door and asked in confusion, "Is the whole village here to watch?"

Alexander understood what he meant.

In the city, passersby would at most take a glance and continue with their business.

But this was the countryside, a small place.

If something happened, everyone would come to watch and use it as a topic for conversation.

"That's normal. They can discuss a trivial matter for half a month, let alone a murder case."Alexander said.

Charles remained silent.

Dennis looked at the houses in front of him, not knowing where to start, and asked, "Which room?"

Robert was about to make a call when a young man, about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, came out of the main hall, warmly greeting them, "You arrived quickly, must be tired coming from the neighboring city."

The man was dressed in casual clothes, with a gentle smile and a clean appearance. Compared to the other villagers of Willowbrook Village, he was very clean, which made people feel comfortable.

Among the villagers, he was definitely a handsome guy.

"Hello, let me introduce myself. I'm Jordan Taylor." Jordan was easygoing and warm, shaking hands with Robert and the others one by one.

When he got to Zoey, he gave her a hug, "And a lady, thank you for your hard work."

Zoey frowned slightly, momentarily forgetting to push him away.

It was Robert who stepped forward and pulled Jordan away.

Jordan quickly realized his hug might have startled Zoey and immediately gave her an apologetic look.

Dennis, Charles, and the others were also stunned.

Jordan was taking advantage of Zoey, the only female in their criminal investigation team, in public.

Robert changed the subject, "Zack, can you brief us on the situation at the scene?"

Jordan, recovering from his awkward smile, said, "Sure, follow me."

He walked towards the main hall, and Robert and the others followed him.

Alexander deliberately slowed his pace, walking close to Zoey, and said in a voice only they could hear, "I thought you would dodge or use a takedown move."

Zoey replied, "If it were you, I would do what you say."

Alexander fell silent.

He shouldn't have asked; he brought it upon himself.

Upon entering the main hall, besides the local technicians, they immediately saw three female corpses on the ground. They were all covered with white cloth.

Robert stepped forward, and the members of the criminal investigation team skillfully put on disposable gloves and lifted the white cloth.

All three female corpses were uncovered, and exposed to everyone.

The three female corpses were dressed plainly, their clothes intact, but they were barefoot. Their faces were cyanotic, tongues slightly protruding, bodies stiff, with obvious ligature marks on their necks, though not deep. Judging by their appearance, the three girls were young, around twenty years old.

Robert, a seasoned detective, took one look and made a judgment, "The crime scene has been tampered with."

Jordan sighed deeply, "Yes, ever since the bodies were discovered, a lot of people have come to see them. You know, in this poor rural area, the villagers haven't had much education and don't understand the importance of preserving the crime scene. As soon as I found out, I rushed over to stop further damage."

###chapter 83

Jordan casually pointed at someone in the crowd and introduced herself to Robert. "That's the person who reported the case. She kept the villagers from getting too close to the body, preventing further damage to the scene."

Robert asked, "What's the cause of death?"

Jordan replied, "Preliminary examination shows no external injuries. Based on the characteristics of the death, it was mechanical asphyxiation, meaning strangulation. The ligature marks extend behind the ears, consistent with hanging, but the body was found lying on the ground."

Dennis, after hearing this, said, "Did someone take the body down?"

Jordan added, "You know the scene here has been severely compromised, so we can't rule out that possibility. The person who reported the case told me the body was already on the ground when she found it." He sighed, seemingly frustrated by the ignorance of the rural people.

"The technicians also found many fingerprints on the victim's clothes. Looks like we'll be busy for a while."

Everyone fell silent.

Jordan seemed to remember something and added, "By the way, the preliminary estimated time of death is between 11 PM last night and 3 AM this morning."

"Was there any sign of sexual assault on the body?" Zoey suddenly asked.

"We'll need further tests to determine that," Jordan replied.

"Keep me updated with any new developments."

Jordan nodded at Zoey, "No problem."

Alexander glanced at the footprints in the dust on the ground and took a few steps back, "Are these footprints from the villagers?"

"Yes," Jordan said with a bitter smile, "There are too many footprints. Even if the killer's prints are among them, we can't use them. And there aren't surveillance cameras in Willowbrook Village, which makes it tough."

Robert felt a bit helpless. He knew that the clues were unusable, wondering if they had to rely on guesses to solve the case.

He scratched his head, trying to appear calm, "Alright, I understand." He turned to Dennis, "You guys find a room and set it up as our temporary interrogation room."

"OK, Officer Davis!" Dennis replied.

As Dennis and his team were about to leave, Robert called them back, "Also, get the identities of the three victims and take statements from their friends and family."

"Got it!"

Robert then instructed Charles and Alexander, "You two take the technicians and collect fingerprints and DNA from everyone in the village. Make a list of the villagers, including those working outside."

"No problem!" Alexander and Dennis began investigating the three deceased women, while Zoey followed Robert to take a statement from the person who reported the case.

Except for the main hall, the other small rooms were too dirty.

They spent an hour cleaning one of the rooms before starting their work.

Robert, who had driven all night, was already tired. He was visibly exhausted after taking statements for four or five hours without rest.

He forced himself to stay awake and told Zoey to take a break, "I'll go contact the person who reported the case."

Zoey nodded and sat on a chair in the cleaned room.

About twenty minutes later, Robert brought in a woman.

Although the woman dressed similarly to the other villagers of Willowbrook Village, her outstanding demeanor suggested she wasn't a native.

The woman noticed Zoey observing her but remained calm.

Under Robert's arrangement, she sat next to Zoey.

"Routine questioning, don't be nervous. Just tell us what you know, and we won't make things difficult for you," Robert reminded her, and Zoey began the routine questioning.

"Name."

"Rilla Vaughn."

"How old are you? Are you a local?"

"I'm 27, born and raised in Willowbrook Village."

Robert glanced at her, "Tell us about the day you found the body. What happened? Did you notice any suspicious people?"

Rilla thought for a moment and began to describe, "I remember it was quite early, around 7 AM. My mom woke me up quickly, telling me several girls were missing from the village! The village chief and the parents of the missing girls were searching everywhere and gathered everyone to help. I remember one of the missing girls was Janet Fuller, who was supposed to marry the village chief's son."

"Those with electric bikes were sent to search farther away, while others searched the nearby mountains. I joined the group, hoping to slack off a bit, and accidentally found them in the church."

Robert took notes and habitually asked, "When you found them, were their bodies lying on the ground like they are now?"

Rilla thought for a moment and replied, "Yes, they were lying there. But when I saw them, their pants were partially pulled down. As a fellow woman, I couldn't bear it and put their clothes back on."

Robert continued to take notes of her every word.

Zoey suddenly asked seriously, "You must have studied outside, right? You haven't been in Willowbrook Village all your life, have you?"

Rilla and Robert both looked at Zoey, and then Robert turned his gaze back to Rilla, who nodded, "Yes, I went to college in Skylake City."

Hearing she was a college graduate, Zoey said with a hint of sarcasm, "Since you went to college, you should be more knowledgeable than the villagers. So why did you tamper with the crime scene? Don't tell me you didn't know such basic common sense."

"And Mr. Bailey told me you stopped the villagers from touching the bodies. Why did you touch them yourself?"

The questions Zoey threw out made Rilla seem suspicious.

Rilla's gaze never met Zoey's, instead focusing on Zoey's hand holding the pen, "Our village is quite traditional, with some stubborn beliefs. I'm not interested in crime dramas, so I didn't think much about it. I just felt it was disrespectful to the girls to leave them like that, maybe because I'm also a woman, so I helped them."

"As for why I later stopped the villagers with Mr. Bailey, they wanted to bury the bodies and didn't want me to call the cop. Reputation is very important in Willowbrook Village. Whether the girls were dead or not, their parents would feel ashamed. I told them the police would arrest anyone who touched the bodies, so they stopped."

###chapter 84

Robert found an entry point and asked, "Besides helping them put on their pants, did you touch anything else?"

"No, I helped them put on their pants and immediately called the cop. The officer on the phone told me to maintain the scene. After that, you know the rest."

Robert added, "Do you know these three deceased individuals?"

Rilla replied, "You can see for yourself, Willowbrook Village is so small, and everyone lives so close to each other, how could we not know each other?"

After asking this, Robert felt his question was redundant.

But there was no other way.

He had to follow the procedures, because the necessary steps had to be taken.

Robert asked, "I mean, how well do you know them? Just a greeting when you meet, or are you good friends? Who do you usually stay in touch with the most?"

Rilla said, "It's okay, we all stay in touch about the same. Our village is too poor, most girls can't afford to go to school. They all envy me, thinking it's amazing that I went to college, and they always ask me about things outside of Willowbrook Village."

"You've seen the sanitation conditions here. It takes two hours to walk to the middle school. I don't need to tell you about the distance to college, you have to know from driving. Our village doesn't have much money, and those who don't do well in school usually start helping their families with farming early. Only those who get into middle school have the chance to continue their education."

Rilla sighed as she talked about this, "It's better now. A decade or so ago, after finishing middle school, you could get a job assignment. Even if you wanted to go to college, your family wouldn't agree. Their idea was to start working quickly to reduce the family's burden."

Robert had handled many cases and visited relatively backward villages. So he could understand Rilla's situation.

Getting into college from such a poor and backward place showed that Rilla was a talented girl.

"Putting the case aside, you are very outstanding," Robert complimented her generously.

Rilla forced a smile, "I have a younger brother. If he hadn't died unexpectedly in middle school, I wouldn't have had the chance to go to college."

Hearing this, Zoey was puzzled. "If you wanted to leave so badly, why did you come back?"

"My parents are here. I can't just go to college and never come back," Rilla answered with a slightly confrontational tone.

Seeing the tension between the two girls, Robert thought Rilla's personal matters were unrelated to the case.

He quickly steered the conversation back. "Let's not talk about that. Tell me what you know. Do you know if these three deceased individuals had any grudges with anyone? Or if their parents had any enemies?"

"I'm not sure about that," Rilla said, then added, "I know a bit about Janet. She told me before that she didn't want to get married, she wanted to see the outside world, and didn't want to be stuck here for life. As for the other two girls, I don't know anything about them."

Robert nodded. "Okay."

Zoey asked, "What do you think about the fact that they were found lying on the ground with their pants removed?"

"No opinion."

"No opinion?" Zoey raised her intense gaze, staring straight at her. "Is it normal in your village for women to have their pants removed?"

Rilla was an educated college student! How could she not be affected at all?

Rilla remained silent.

Seeing Rilla not speaking, Zoey didn't press further.

She changed the topic. "Does this kind of thing happen often in your village?"

Rilla didn't know what she meant, "What kind of thing?"

"People dying, what else?"

Rilla was silent, feeling a bit speechless about this question. "As far as I can remember, this is the first time."

"Oh." Zoey nonchalantly noted it down and continued asking, "What about sexual assault?"

She asked so bluntly and casually that Rilla didn't know how to respond for a moment.

She thought for a while and said, "I haven't heard of such a thing. But if it happened, people wouldn't talk about such a shameful thing. In the countryside, people like to gossip. If more people knew, the whole village would know. Villages are interconnected, and it would be hard to get married in the area."

Zoey understood and had asked enough.

She handed her notes to Robert.

Robert asked some other questions, "What time do people in your village usually go to bed and get up?"

Rilla replied, "I can't give you an exact time, it's different for everyone. But most people go to bed around nine. As you can see, we don't have any entertainment facilities, at most we visit each other's homes. But the wake-up time is similar, around five or six, either to work or to go to school."

"How long has this church been abandoned? Have you seen anyone frequently going there?" Robert added.

Rilla said, "This church has been here for hundreds of years. It's been like this since I can remember. My mom said it was like this when she got married. No one goes there every day, except for some curious kids. But they get beaten by their parents when they come home. Since it's so old, no one knows when it might collapse. For their children's safety, they try hard to stop their kids from going there."

Zoey suddenly asked, "Were there many villagers looking for them that day?"

"Not many. Many were working, and some were at school. Those looking were mostly women or elderly people who could still move around. Because our village is small."

"Alright." Robert organized his notes and looked at Rilla gratefully. "Thank you for your cooperation. If I need anything else, I'll come to you."

"No problem," Rilla said and left.

Alexander and Dennis waited at the door until Rilla left before coming in.

"Officer Davis, we found something." Dennis, seeing Robert's look, reported his findings, "One of the deceased, named Janet, had parents who were both born and raised in Willowbrook Village. She had an older brother. The other two deceased were sisters, with the same mother and father. The older sister was named Faye Lynn, and the younger sister was named Sadie Lynn, one was nineteen, and the other sixteen. Their parents were also born and raised in Willowbrook Village. When the incident happened, they rushed over, and we found they had a twelve-year-old brother."

Zoey suddenly felt a bit empathetic. "No wonder it's such a backward place." The desire for a son was evident from their childbearing.

###chapter 85

Alexander continued Dennis's words, "Some villagers who didn't want to reveal their names told us that Janet had originally agreed with her family to go out to work next month. Unexpectedly, the village chief's son came back from outside these days, took a liking to Janet at first sight, and discussed the engagement with her parents, saying that once engaged, he would take Janet to the county, which would be a kind of care."

Robert found this clue interesting and immediately asked, "Did Janet like him?"

"Does it matter? His father is the village chief, practically a god to these people. They might not listen to the cop, but they have to listen to the village chief," Dennis couldn't help but complain.

"What era is this, still controlling children's marriages?" Robert was angry but had no way to change it. He let out a heavy sigh.

Zoey retorted Robert's words, "This isn't about parental control over marriage, is it? He clearly saw that Janet was the prettiest and chose her. If the village chief is the highest official here, then the village chief's son would naturally be seen as the second most authoritative person."

The others thought Zoey made sense and nodded in agreement.

"There's another thing I find quite unusual," Dennis said. "You say these kids are dead, how can their parents be so calm? I just asked them to come over and make a statement, and their parents actually told me that this church is an unfortunate place and refused to come."

"Unfortunate?" Robert's frown deepened.

He now had one thought, more important than solving the case. How could they change their deeply ingrained beliefs?

Robert snapped, "If they won't come, we'll go! I want to see exactly how these rotten ideas have harmed the people of this village! Let's go!"

"Alright, let's go!" With Dennis leading the way, they left the church. After walking a few steps, they saw a small shop.

Charles went in to buy a few bottles of water and came out looking aggrieved. "Do you know how much this water costs? Guess!"

"What happened?"

"5 dollars!" Charles's resentful eyes were almost about to explode with anger. "They say their village is backward, but I don't see it at all. They saw I wasn't from the village and jacked up the price!"

"Damn, 5 dollars, they really dare to ask for that!" Dennis was speechless. "Aren't the villagers supposed to be honest and simple-minded?"

"Aren't there any bad people in the village?" Clearly, Zoey's joke didn't land well.

The others were slightly stunned, unable to understand her humor.

Only Alexander couldn't help but laugh.

Robert added a laugh, "Haha, right, it's okay. We're not staying long anyway, consider it a donation."

They didn't mention it again, and Dennis led them forward.

After a few steps, they saw a brick house with a small yard. Dennis said, "If my memory serves me right, this is Janet's home."

Dennis had already informed them beforehand. They entered the yard together, and a dog ran over, barking at them.

Robert looked at the small black dog that could be kicked away with one foot, "This dog is quite fierce."

Small as it was, it showed no fear of the much larger beings.

As soon as he finished speaking, the door of the brick house opened from the inside.

A woman, about fifty or sixty years old, wearing a white headscarf, was about to come out. Seeing the group, she stopped in her tracks.

She looked warily at the strangers who had suddenly entered her home and asked, "Why are you at my house?"

Robert took a step forward, with a formal smile, and said, "Hello, we are cops here to investigate a case. Are you Janet's mother, Renee Russell?"

"cop?" From Renee's tone, it was clear she had a strong aversion to the police. "Ask away, I'm feeding the dog."

Seeing her attitude, Robert confirmed again, "Mrs. Fuller, you need to answer my questions first. Janet is your daughter, right?"

Renee bent down, picked up the dog's food bowl, and petted the small black dog, answering nonchalantly, "Yes."

The others looked at each other, puzzled. Why wasn't she sad about Janet's death?

Dennis whispered to Charles, "Is Janet really her biological daughter? Janet's body is still lying in the church, how can she be so calm?"

Renee happened to hear this.

She turned around, glaring at Dennis, "She's just a useless thing. The village chief's son taking a liking to her was her good fortune. Which girl in this village doesn't want to marry him? She died too early, I didn't get any advantages, a worthless thing!"

The entire investigation team was fuming.

Renee, still oblivious, continued muttering, "Janet, being pretty is useless and foolish, always thinking about going to the city to work. How can city life be better than here? Does she even know how many advantages she could get by marrying the village chief's son? Useless, truly unfortunate!"

"Please respect the deceased!" Alexander, who had been silent, finally spoke, "Janet is your daughter. How can you, as her mother, be so indifferent? Why did you give birth to her in the first place?"

Renee, suddenly enraged, turned to attack Alexander. "It's none of your business. I give birth if I want to. She is worthless, causing such a big commotion. She deserved it."

The entire investigation team was puzzled.

Changing the villagers' rotten beliefs seemed more urgent than solving the case.

"Hey! You're Janet's mother, how can you say such things?" Charles snapped.

Robert pulled the impulsive Charles back, pushing him behind, while he himself suppressed his anger.

He still appeared calm as he asked, "Who was Janet closest to?"

Renee replied, "Janet was closest to the two girls who died with her. Every time I pulled Janet to the fields, they would come and talk to her all day, leaving me to do most of the work. They were just two unfortunate people, now they're all dead."

Seeing her getting more agitated, about to curse Janet again, Robert quickly changed the topic, "Besides those two girls?"

"How would I know? Everyone in Willowbrook Village knows each other. I only know Janet was close to them, I don't know about others."

Zoey suddenly asked, "Before the village chief's son proposed to Janet, did they have any interaction? Did Janet clearly show any refusal or dislike?"

###chapter 86

"How would I know? They only met once during the blind dating. They haven't had any other contact."

"Living in the same village, how could they have only met during the blind dating ?" Zoey pressed on, not letting her off the hook.

Renee was already very impatient but had to brush them off. "They met when they were kids, but then they went to school. The village chief's son grew up in the county, so he didn't see Janet again. Now that he's grown up and returned, they met again for blind dating. What's wrong with that?"

Zoey looked at her coldly, "We have interviewed other villagers, and they told us that Janet didn't want to get married. She plans to go out to work next month. Did she mention this to you?"

Upon hearing this, Renee's mocking smile almost overflowed, "Janet, an illiterate girl, wants to go out and earn money? How much can she earn? I think she just wants to go out and be taken advantage of by city folks. She might as well get married early and be a proper woman, taking care of her husband and children at home."

Zoey mocked, "Like an idiot like you?"

Renee was puzzled.

Renee, was a woman who had been living in the countryside for years. How could she be intimidated by a young girl like Zoey?

Renee's shrewish demeanor instantly surfaced, "You little girl, you really have a sharp tongue. Did your mother teach you to talk like this to your elders? A child like you must have a bad mother. Seeing you, I can almost imagine what your mother is like!"

"Really? Keep cursing." Zoey said.

Renee fell silent, thinking Zoey was crazy.

Zoey's words were more effective than a hundred retorts, which stunned Renee directly.

Zoey looked at her calmly and said, "I don't mind at all if an idiot like you curses another idiot in front of me."

After all, she felt satisfied.

Renee, who made her unhappy, also cursed someone who made her equally unhappy. Why wouldn't she enjoy such a good thing?

Renee fell silent.

The other members of the criminal investigation team didn't understand what was going on.

They thought Renee was about to face a more violent retaliation.

However, Zoey didn't say anything next, with a slight smile on her lips.

The others remained silent.

"You're not afraid of anything, are you? Hmm? You're quite something. Today, I'll make you regret doing it!" Renee stepped forward, unable to control herself.

Alexander saw that they were about to fight.

Thinking of Brian's mother's incident, he quickly stepped in front of Zoey, trying to calm the situation.

He smiled and explained the misunderstanding, "Mrs. Fuller, we're here to ask about Janet's whereabouts, nothing else. You might have misunderstood her words. She didn't mean it that way."

"Right!" Robert also helped change the topic, "The night before last, the day of the incident, did Janet show any unusual behavior? Also, what time does she usually go to bed?"

Renee knew they were all in this together.

Seeing the men protecting Zoey, she couldn't find any opportunity to strike.

Renee glared at Zoey behind Alexander and replied angrily, "In the countryside, we go to bed around nine after finishing work. I'm usually too busy to care about her."

Robert added, "Before this, did Janet ever go out in the middle of the night?"

Renee replied, "I don't know. I sleep too deeply every night, from night till morning. Even if she went out, I wouldn't know. She might have gone out to mess with the men and got herself killed. When she suddenly told me she wanted to go out to work, I knew she wasn't a good person! She deserved to die. If she hadn't died, the Fuller Family's dignity would have been ruined."

Renee's response was simply shocking.

They couldn't understand why working would be equated with going out to fool around.

Janet was clearly Renee's daughter.

How could a mother use such despicable words to describe her daughter?

Robert asked some other questions.

Renee's answers were almost always the same, either "I don't know" or cursing Janet.

Renee complained that Janet was inefficient at work, and cursed her for dreaming of going out to work.

Cursed her for not contributing anything to the Fuller Family and dying after they raised her for so many years.

Robert and the other members of the criminal investigation team couldn't listen any longer, each with deeply furrowed brows.

Robert raised his hand to stop Renee's continued cursing and asked, "Can we take a look at Janet's room?"

"Go ahead, it's the first room on the left." After Renee finished speaking, she pointed it out to everyone.

The group went in and found that Janet shared a large rural bed with Renee, a large rural bed.

On the bed was an old wooden box filled with clothes, looking very worn out.

There were traces of insects gnawing everywhere.

On the wooden box was a cheap makeup cream used by Renee and Janet.

Inside the wooden box were a few patched-up clothes, and nothing else.

Most of the clothes were Renee's.

Janet had very few clothes, and the few she had were altered from Renee's clothes.

After leaving Janet's house, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

Renee was the epitome of victim-blaming.

Renee's shallow thinking led her to believe that Janet must have done something wrong to get herself killed.

After all, rural people have simple minds, and their families had no known enemies.

No one would be so insane as to rape and kill, and then leave the victim's pants half off, even in death, to humiliate the victim.

Renee even told them, "I don't think you can find out anything. You might as well send Janet's body back early so I can hold a funeral and see if I can get some money. I don't want to have raised her for nothing! My son will be back soon, and we need money for many things."

Everyone was speechless.

"Aren't rural people supposed to be simple and honest? Why do I see a different side in Renee?" Dennis complained, "She is worse than a beast! Even animals know to protect their young. I often watch nature shows, and mother deer will slow down to let lions and tigers chase them to protect their fawns. Isn't that what motherly love should be?"

At least, in Dennis's understanding, it was a bit terrifying.

Zoey calmly opened a bottle of water and took a sip, "Isn't this normal? There are plenty of people like this."

She seemed used to it, even though she was the youngest in the criminal investigation team, she acted more mature than the others.

###chapter 87

Robert always felt that Zoey's family of origin might not have been very happy, but he couldn't directly ask about such things.

He casually agreed, "They have low cultural exposure. Isn't that how it is in rural areas? After having a boy, he can be the head of the family, while girls are destined to serve others. Renee might hate Janet so much because she doesn't want Janet to end up like her, living a miserable life without any say in the family."

"Officer Davis, are you serious?" Dennis and Charles almost spoke in unison, questioning him.

How did they not see this from Renee's earlier behavior?

Whenever Renee mentioned Janet, it was always bad and impatient.

Could Renee be the kind of mother Robert described?

That would be too harsh. Even if Janet hadn't died, imagining themselves in Janet's life would be suffocating. Janet would want to commit suicide too.

"At least as a parent, I don't want to assume the worst about other parents. Some people just have different ways of loving their children." Robert didn't want to talk about the harm Janet's family of origin had caused her anymore.

He turned and discussed the findings of Janet's case with the others.

After a short break, they all went to the Lynn Family.

Charles stepped forward intending to knock, but seeing the distance between the front and the inner doors, he hesitated.

He raised his hand but awkwardly put it down again.

If he knocked, the people inside definitely wouldn't hear it.

"Just shout!" Robert was a bit exasperated with Charles, thinking he was indeed foolish without understanding such a simple thing.

"Oh." Charles cleared his throat and shouted towards the gate, "Is anyone there? Open the door!"

As soon as he finished speaking, a woman holding a child came out. The child was very dirty, clearly from spending too much time on the farm with his parents.

His snot unknowingly slid down to his lips, and he sucked it back up.

And the woman looked very old, clearly someone who had lived a hard life. Even without doing anything, her face showed her sorrow, which seemed to follow her everywhere.

Seeing the strangers outside, she spoke before the criminal investigation team could ask, "You must be the new cops."

"Yes, we're here for a simple visit to understand some basic information about the victim's current situation."

"Okay." She spoke softly, without much energy, and stepped back with the child. "Officers, please come in."

"You can call me Mr. Davis," Robert said.

The sisters' mother, Cinda Thorne, pursed her lips, making her already weary face look even more tired. "Alright, Mr. Davis, come in and have a seat. I'll get you some water."

Alexander shook the bottled water in his hand. "No need to trouble yourself; we have water."

"No need to entertain us. We're just here to take some notes. Sorry to bother you," Robert added.

"Okay." She carried the little boy to his room and gave him a piece of candy. "Unless Mommy calls you, don't come out."

"Okay." The little boy eagerly unwrapped the candy and put it in his mouth, obediently closing the door.

Seeing no one else in the house, Robert began to examine the layout of the room. "Did you know your two daughters went out the night of the incident?"

Cinda shook her head. "I really didn't know. If I had known, I wouldn't have let them go. As you can see, my son is still young. I sleep with him every night, and the sisters share a room. On the day of the incident, I didn't hear a thing."

"What time did you go to bed that night?"

"Usually around nine. After putting the child to sleep, I go to bed too. The sisters might chat for a while. Sometimes they don't sleep until ten, and I would scold them a bit. After that, they didn't talk much at night."

Robert added, "Who do they usually hang out with?"

Cinda's answer was the same as Renee's. "They like to play with the neighbor's Janet. They go over every day, but they are very obedient and come back in the evening to help with dinner and take care of their brother."

At this point, Cinda couldn't hold back her tears, which streamed down her face.

She seemed to be recalling the sisters' appearance when they were alive.

Alexander immediately took out a tissue and handed it to her.

"Thank you." As she opened the tissue, its fragrance mixed with the air, reaching the noses of the others.

"My two daughters were always so good. I really don't know who could be so cruel to kill them! I have no enemies, and I haven't offended anyone. Willowbrook Village is so small; everyone knows each other." As she spoke, her tears fell even faster.

Zoey and the others stood by, unsure how to comfort her in such a situation.

Compared to Renee, Cinda seemed to have the normal reaction of a mother.

Alexander kept handing her tissues.

They silently watched her cry for a while.

Once Cinda's emotions had somewhat stabilized, Robert continued, "Since your family has no conflicts with others, what about the two girls? Did they have any conflicts with anyone?"

"They were very well-behaved. Everyone in the village knew that. They were so good-natured they wouldn't even dare argue with anyone. How could they have conflicts?"

Zoey tried a different approach. "Well, did any boys in the village pursue them?"

Cinda's sobbing suddenly stopped. She paused, then looked at Zoey excitedly. "Now that you mention it, I remember a few months ago, or maybe last month, Faye told me someone was pursuing her. She didn't like him and rejected him outright."

Seeing a potential lead, Dennis quickly asked, "What was his name?"

"I'm not sure. I asked who it was, wanting to help her decide, but Sadie was there and said Faye didn't like him, so I shouldn't ask."

The group fell silent.

Just when they thought they had a lead, it seemed to vanish.

Dennis, who had been ready to record, gave up and put away his recorder.

Alexander asked, "Can we see their room?"

"Of course." Cinda opened their room and let them look around freely.

###chapter 88

"When they left, everything was just as it is now. I haven't touched anything," Cinda said, and then she started crying again.

It might be because the scene brought back painful memories.

The entire first team of the criminal investigation unit skillfully put on gloves and shoe covers and entered the house.

The sisters' room was not big, but it was very clean, with a scent of laundry detergent, indicating that they were very tidy people. Every piece of clothing smelled fresh.

Apart from a homemade wooden bed for sleeping, there was also a very ordinary wooden table.

On the table were several stacks of elementary school books, and underneath was a long bench, just enough for two people to sit on.

The moment Robert stepped into the room, he felt something was off.

He turned and asked the still sobbing Cinda, "Can I ask you something? Is their room usually this tidy?"

Hearing Robert's question, Cinda glanced inside.

She was clearly taken aback. "I rarely went into their room before. They were usually very clean, but it wasn't like this... I can't quite put my finger on what's wrong."

Dennis pointed out the problem, which was the neatly folded quilt. "Officer Davis is asking about this. Did they usually fold their quilt like this?"

Cinda immediately shook her head. "No, I wouldn't even fold a quilt like this. This is too neat. When I helped them clean their room, I only swept the floor."

Zoey opened the wardrobe, and the clothes inside were also neatly folded.

Although there weren't many clothes, they were organized by season.

This clearly didn't seem like the mindset of rural people. They couldn't possibly have such meticulous living habits.

Zoey asked, "How long has it been since you last came here?"

Cinda thought for a moment and replied, "About half a month. I was doing a total cleaning at home and helped them mop the floor. The last time I checked, their quilt wasn't folded like this."

While they were talking, Alexander went to the wooden table and looked through the items on it.

Apart from a piggy bank, there were some elementary school books.

Alexander asked, "Did they both graduate from elementary school?"

Cinda sighed, "Yes, they only went to elementary school. Both of my daughters were good students, but being good at studying is useless. In our village, girls usually only go to elementary school; no one continues their education."

"Why is it useless?" Zoey asked.

"Our village is like this. The family doesn't have money, so we have to save it for the boys," Cinda, a victim of the deeply ingrained preference for boys, explained.

At least she could still have some rationality; she knew to cry after her daughters died, unlike Renee.

"Why is it useful for boys to go to school?" Zoey asked, not taking her eyes off Cinda's guilty look. She continued, answering her own question, "To get a wife."

Cinda remained silent.

Alexander, worried that Zoey might hurt Cinda, walked over to her and said in a voice they could hear, "Stop talking."

Zoey glanced at him but didn't say anything more.

Dennis took out a UV flashlight and carefully scanned the room. Fingerprints were everywhere, evidence of the sisters' lives. There were too many fingerprints, making it difficult to collect evidence.

He walked to the window and unexpectedly found a faint footprint.

He looked outside.

The windowsill was about 4 feet from the ground, and outside was an open yard.

He speculated, "On the night of the incident, the two victims might have climbed out of the window. They must have been hiding something from their family and didn't want them to know."

Seeing this, Robert immediately asked, "Have they mentioned anything to you recently that you didn't agree to, like going somewhere to play?"

Cinda thought carefully, then shook her head. "Faye used to often say she wanted Sadie to go back to school, but she hasn't mentioned it for a while."

"Anything else?"

"No."

The criminal investigation team fell into deep thought.

What had the sisters encountered, or what were they secretly doing?

Why would they climb out of the window in the middle of the night?

Zoey also looked for clues by the desk.

They flipped through the books and found the sisters' handwriting in one of the notebooks.

It was all written in pencil, and over time, many of the words had blurred.

She glanced at the simple pencil holder next to the piggy bank.

There were four pencils in it, of varying lengths but all quite short. It seemed they had been used for a long time and were cherished, with the tips sharpened to a point.

Alexander noticed that.

He analyzed, "Four pencils, all short and relatively new. They must have been bought recently and used frequently. If one of the pencils had a dull tip, it would mean the others hadn't been used for a while. But all four are new, so they were likely used recently."

Zoey glared at Alexander with disdain.

She pointed to the pencil holder and asked, "Did they usually write or draw?"

Cinda thought for a moment and said, "Yes, sometimes when I was cleaning, I would see them doing something at the table."

Zoey acknowledged and turned to Alexander, "Look through these books and see if there are any recent writings."

Alexander agreed and began searching carefully.

After a while, Dennis and Robert, who hadn't found any clues elsewhere, joined in.

Cinda had no idea why they were so focused on the pencils.

She decided not to wait at the door anymore.

She told them to look around as they pleased and left.

After a while, Zoey put down the book she was holding, "This one hasn't been looked at in a long time."

The others also said they hadn't found any recent markings in their books.

Dennis was curious. "If we haven't found any new markings in their books, where were they writing or drawing?"

Robert put the book back in its original place and suddenly thought of something. "Wait, Kelvin learned to draw. Whether writing or drawing, there should be a sketchbook for practice. When Kelvin was in school, they would give out a lot of these books each semester."

"Yes, Officer Davis, you're right. I had the same thing when I was a kid!" Dennis suddenly realized many doubts and speculated, "Their sketchbooks are missing? Did someone hide them? Why would they hide their sketchbooks?"

This was a new discovery, but it couldn't be fully considered a breakthrough.

Robert added, "Why would they take the sketchbooks? They wouldn't be worth much even if sold as scrap. Let's search again and see if the sketchbooks might be in another part of the room. Try to keep the room as it was."

"OK!"

###chapter 89

Zoey heard the command and walked directly towards the wooden bed.

Alexander immediately thought of the 'mess' at Brian's house and quickly grabbed Zoey. "Zoey, why don't you search the wardrobe? You should be more familiar with girls' clothes than I am. I'll search over here."

"Search carefully." Zoey rolled her eyes at him.

Only then did Alexander feel relieved. "Okay."

The group searched for a long time but found nothing.

Robert came out of the room, lit a cigarette at the door, and looked at the room they had just searched, deep in thought. "There shouldn't be nothing at all. It's just a draft book, it shouldn't be so clean that there's not even a single draft book, right?"

Robert added, "Let's go back to the crime scene later."

"Yes!" The group restored the room to its original state and prepared to leave.

Zoey paused at the door, looking at the clean and tidy room, and suddenly said, "Do you guys have a feeling?"

"What feeling?"

"It feels more like they were saying goodbye in this way."

As soon as she voiced her thought, Alexander's steps also halted. "I think your idea... um... I don't know how to say it, it feels both right and wrong. If they were saying goodbye as you said, they would at least take the money, right? The money in the piggy bank wasn't touched, and they didn't even take basic clothes. Two kids without these, where could they go?"

Dennis took a deep breath. "But, I feel like Zoey is right. Their behavior of saying goodbye, it fits with their planning to leave. Is it possible that the killer tricked them? Then said to meet at the church at a certain time at night and leave with Janet?"

Robert followed their speculation and continued guessing. "The killer might have said they didn't need to bring anything, which can avoid drawing attention, so as not to alert others."

"It could also delay time." Zoey added, "Generally, parents would think that as long as nothing is missing from home, they wouldn't immediately think their children are missing. The villagers said they wake up around five or six, but only Rilla said she was woken up at seven. The victim's parents didn't realize the children were missing until they didn't come home."

"However," Zoey paused and continued, "I always feel there's one unclear point. If the killer wanted to kill, there's no need to delay time. Because the murder would be discovered quickly."

If the killer really wanted to delay time, they wouldn't place the bodies in the church. But rather somewhere farther away.

Obviously, there was a logical conflict.

Inside the room, apart from their voices, there were the sounds of fowls from the yard.

"Have they all left?"

Robert glanced to the side. "They went out. These people are really trusting, leaving a few strangers in their home without watching."

"They think we're cops. With us here, they feel safer."

The group shared a knowing smile and left.

Returning to the church, they saw Jordan sitting on the steps playing with his phone from a distance.

Noticing the group returning, he quickly stood up and greeted them warmly. "Officer Davis! We've collected fingerprints and DNA from the villagers and the children. The men have gone to work and will be back later."

"Alright, thanks." Robert walked around the village, getting to know the villagers' living habits, which matched what Jordan had said. "Alright, we'll go together tonight to lighten your workload a bit."

Jordan responded and then asked, "How did your visits go? Any findings?"

Robert shared their investigation direction with him and then said, "The crime scene has been mostly examined. Let's see if there's anything new. Later, we'll visit the village head's house to find out who was pursuing Faye."

"OK!" The group arrived at the church, and the bodies of the three girls were no longer there.

They had been taken to the city police station for further examination.

The crime scene was marked with special dust.

Several evidence markers stood irregularly around.

Zoey bypassed the body outline and bent down next to one of the markers.

This spot had four overlapping footprints.

She slowly looked up, and above was the horizontal beam of the roof.

The distance between the beam and the ground was such that a man over 5' 6" tall could almost reach it by jumping.

Jordan took out the survey report on his phone and came to Zoey's side, thoughtfully explaining. "The four footprints can be divided into two groups. It's been confirmed that the larger group belongs to Janet, and the other group to Sadie."

He looked up and continued, "There are three sets of ligature marks on the beam. Based on the depth and friction characteristics, it's preliminarily determined that the bodies were hung with a 9.6-inch diameter hemp rope. We haven't found it yet."

Jordan pointed to the 5th and 6th markers on the ground. " There are four square marks, two in each group, with a distance of 3 feet between the groups. We compared them with a borrowed stool from a household, and it fit perfectly. This means the killer likely stood on the stool to hang the bodies."

Zoey asked, "What's the distance between the three sets of ligature marks?"

"About 1' 6", less than 3 feet."

Zoey nodded. "The stool isn't long enough, so the killer would have moved while hanging the bodies. But this spot has a lot of dust, so it left stool leg marks."

Jordan glanced around. "Officer Davis just told me you were looking for a draft book. When we examined the bodies, they had nothing on them, and there's no place nearby to hide a draft book."

Zoey responded, "The draft book might not be related to the case. It's just our speculation. If there's nothing in it, that's best, it means we overthought. The killer wouldn't let us find something easily if there is something."

Maybe the killer had already dealt with it, because a draft book was easy to dispose of in the countryside.

Jordan seemed to think this case had nothing to do with him, his attitude was very relaxed, and he smiled as he comforted Zoey. "Willowbrook Village is only so big. If necessary, we can search every house thoroughly."

Zoey responded perfunctorily, "Yeah, that's a good idea."

###chapter 90

Alexander, who saw them so close, was already quite jealous.

Since the autopsy report would take a while and there were three bodies, they roughly calculated the time and figured that it would be just about time to get from Willowbrook Village to the city bureau.

Waiting for the autopsy to investigate would take too long.

Robert decided to start by asking about the things discussed by the villagers.

It would be best to find out who exactly was interested in Faye, and this might be a clue.

Robert glanced at his team and pointed at Dennis. "You, come over here and stand by my side."

Dennis thought he was assigned to Robert's group and happily stood over.

Robert said, "Dennis and I won't go. We look a bit intimidating, and the village women probably won't want to talk to us. So, you guys go."

Hearing that, Dennis couldn't help but think, 'What? I'm a cop. How could I look intimidating? I am really handsome.'

Feeling inexplicably hurt, he couldn't even retort. Because Robert had included himself in this.

Dennis had to swallow this grievance.

Zoey was originally going to go with Jordan, but as they were about to leave, Alexander approached Zoey. "Zoey, shall we go together?"

Before Zoey could answer, Jordan asked from the side. "Why?"

Alexander was, of course, afraid that Zoey might do something outrageous. Wouldn't she become famous in the entire police force?

To maintain the image of the investigation team in front of outsiders, he had to sacrifice his own interests for the greater good.

Alexander couldn't say that, so he just smiled gently. "There are some details in the notes that I want to discuss with Zoey."

Alexander's excuse was flawless. Jordan couldn't interfere at all.

He had to team up with Charles, leaving the small team he had just formed with Zoey.

Zoey didn't care who her partner was.

As soon as they walked out of the church, most of the village came into view.

There was a unique beauty to standing at a high point.

Zoey asked, "Where should we go to gather information now?"

Alexander replied, "The usual information exchange centers are in stores, right? Why don't we check out that supermarket?"

"Let's go."

There was only one store in the village, the same one that sold Charles overpriced bottled water.

When they arrived, it was just before dark, around dusk.

A few women of similar age were sitting on small stools, eating snacks and chatting, with the snack crumbs surrounding them on the ground.

Seeing this scene, Alexander couldn't help but connect it to some TV show scenes.

No wonder people said inspiration came from life. This was rural life.

Zoey stood at the gate, looking at the laughing women, then turned to Alexander. "You go."

Alexander obediently went in.

He held a smile on his lips, looking quite handsome, and he was very polite.

The women stared at him for a while and invited him to sit. "Handsome, come, sit."

Alexander sat down obediently. "Thank you. Have you had dinner?"

"Not yet." Answered a short-haired woman in the group, her tone indicating she didn't dislike Alexander.

Before Alexander could further integrate, she asked him. "I heard you came from the big city. Where? Can you tell us what's different about the big city?"

"The big city?" Alexander didn't want these women to dominate the conversation; he was here to integrate with them.

He casually said, "I feel the big city isn't as good as Willowbrook Village. The environment here is so good. From the moment I entered the village, I felt the air was sweeter than in the city."

What he said was true: the city's car exhaust severely pollutes the air, but in the village, the air was the most original.

Talking about the environment, the woman in the black sweater next to the short-haired woman sighed, "You really know how to talk, but what you said is true. How can the city's environment compare to our Willowbrook Village? It can't."

"Yes, and city people are usually very busy with work, with no time to connect with each other. Relationships are very cold. Look at Willowbrook Village, after dinner, we can visit each other."

"That's right!" The woman in red said, "Although we are backward here, the human touch is strong. I heard that city people living together don't even know each other."

"Exactly, we are closer than family."

Alexander saw them talking more and more, not knowing how to start.

He thought for a while and pretended to be sad. "Yes, everyone is so close. Now that three young girls have died, you must be very sad."

After he said this, the smiles on the women's faces disappeared strangely for a moment.

The short-haired woman sighed heavily and began to mourn, "Yes, these kids grew up under my watch. Just a few days ago, they greeted me warmly in the village, and now..."

"We are okay, but their parents must be the most heartbroken. Raising kids for so long, and suddenly they're gone. How painful it must be."

A woman who hadn't spoken suddenly sneered. "Heartbroken? It depends on the person. Janet's mom, Renee, definitely isn't heartbroken! Renee either hit or scolded Janet every day. If Janet hadn't died, she would have been hit to death. Renee always regretted giving birth to her. I even suspect that Janet was cursed to death by her daily curses."

"Renee never wanted to have Janet. The first child was a son, and she didn't plan to have a second. It was discovered too late, and the medication couldn't abort it. She didn't want to spend money on surgery, so Janet was born. I know, on the day of her birth, Janet's dad, knowing it was a girl, kept cursing outside, saying they had a useless daughter."

"Now that Janet is dead, the couple must be overjoyed!"

Alexander glanced at Zoey and pretended to ask casually. "I heard Janet was going to marry the village chief's son. They could get many advantages from this. How could she not be happy?"

The woman looked at him as if he didn't understand. "Haha, the village chief's wife is so stingy, so they couldn't get anything from them."

She pulled Alexander and said, "Renee wanted to get close to the village chief. Yes, the village chief's family would give money, but Janet's family also had to give some gifts. Would Renee spend money on Janet? Absolutely not. She just wanted to get rid of Janet, and wanted the village chief's son to take Janet away. She wouldn't give anything, and the other side wouldn't give money either. She would be relieved."

###chapter 91

Alexander couldn't understand such thoughts and mindset at all.

If it hadn't come from the short-haired woman, he wouldn't have believed that a biological mother would do such a thing to her own daughter.

"Oh, I see. So if Janet and the village chief's son like each other, Janet can leave home, which would be a good thing for her." Alexander said.

"A good thing? Hahaha." The woman in the black sweater was laughing at Alexander. "Have you seen the village chief's son? Which girl in the village likes him? Who could like him? He's not even as tall as I am, and his looks, don't even mention it."

She seemed to want to complain more, but the short-haired woman beside her nudged her. She also shook her head at her.

After the two exchanged glances, they stopped talking.

Alexander keenly sensed that they seemed to be hiding something, indicating that they couldn't say more.

Alexander was puzzled.

Zoey also heard some of it and walked closer, asking seriously, "So, you're saying Janet doesn't like the village chief's son?"

The short-haired woman and the woman in the black sweater immediately looked at her, their eyes filled with growing terror. "Shh!"

It was as if Zoey's words had touched some taboo of theirs, seeming very strange.

Zoey frowned, not knowing what they were up to.

The short-haired woman continued, "How should I put it, these things are behaviors and results between two people, and both are voluntary. Although the village chief's son is not good-looking, he is rich. Who in the countryside doesn't want their daughter to marry a rich man? Janet is just too foolish.. If she hadn't made such a fuss on the night Renee arranged her engagement, Renee wouldn't have disliked her so much. She cried as if she were dying."

"Isn't she dead?"

The woman in the black sweater added, "I think the most pitiful ones are the two daughters of the Lynn Family. They raised them for so long, and suddenly they were gone. If it weren't for her son still being left, Cinda might have lost the will to live long ago."

"Hasn't her family lost children before? Didn't she live well? Maybe she's used to it."

Alexander was slightly stunned and quickly asked, "The Lynn Family lost children before?"

"That was a long time ago," said the woman in the black sweater. "After Cinda had these two daughters, she had another one, still a girl. She wanted to keep her, but her husband was adamantly against it. They put the child in the river, leaving her fate to destiny."

Alexander was puzzled.

Zoey clenched her fists, "Isn't that murder!"

"That's not murder," said the woman in the black sweater. "When they abandoned the child, I was watching by the river. The child was still breathing, floating down the river. Maybe someone along the river picked her up. Besides, even if they didn't abandon her, their family was too poor to raise so many children."

Zoey's molars were almost grinding to pieces, "If they can't afford to raise them, why have them?"

"Isn't it because they didn't have a boy?"

"Yes, in our village, every family has a boy. If you don't have a son when you're old, you'll be laughed at. And if you don't have a son, you don't have an heir. Without an heir, it's disrespectful to the ancestors, and you'll be punished!"

One of the women even started explaining to Zoey, "Although our village is backward, we're not stupid. A woman must have a son, or you'll be criticized for a lifetime. See that?" She pointed to a house in the village with smoke coming out of the chimney, "That family, the wife couldn't have a son, so she let her husband find another wife. The first time, she had a boy, and now the whole family is doing well."

"Exactly, I found that having a son requires talent. Some people can't have a boy after seven or eight tries, while others have a boy on the first try."

The women started ignoring Zoey and Alexander, launching into another topic.

Talking about how to have a son, they became more enthusiastic.

Zoey listened for a while, her mood shifting from anger to indifference.

She glanced at the time on her phone. They had been talking about this topic for over twenty minutes. She bluntly interjected, "Have any of you ever been to school?"

The women looked at each other, not knowing if her question had anything to do with the case, and nodded in unison.

Zoey also nodded, "Oh, no wonder."

The quieter woman instantly sensed something off in Zoey's tone and asked, "What do you mean? Speak clearly."

"No wonder you..." Zoey hadn't finished.

Alexander quickly interjected with a smile, "I heard someone in the village pursued Faye. Do you know who it was?"

It seemed they were hearing this for the first time.

They quickly shifted their attention from Zoey to Alexander, "What's the situation? Who pursued Faye? Who told you?"

"Did Cinda tell you?"

"Did she say someone was pursuing Faye? What did the guy look like?"

Seeing that they genuinely didn't know, Alexander didn't want to stay with them any longer.

He was also afraid he couldn't hold back, so he maintained his composure, politely said goodbye, and turned to leave with Zoey.

They walked quite a distance before Alexander realized he was still holding Zoey's delicate wrist.

Feeling something was off, he cautiously observed Zoey's face, and he saw her eyes full of murderous intent.

Alexander quickly let go, "Don't be mad, I just..."

Before he could finish explaining, Zoey replied, "I don't get mad at fools."

Alexander said, "Don't call names."

"I didn't call you names." she said angrily, "I'll show you what name-calling looks like someday!"

Alexander was silent, thinking there was no need for that.

They returned to the church, and it was completely dark.

Willowbrook Village had no streetlights, only the lights from nearby houses.

Alexander turned on the flashlight on his phone to lead the way for Zoey.

Willowbrook Village was on a hillside, and at night it was not only cold but also filled with more insect sounds than in the city.

"It's already the 21st century, and our country still has such backward places." Alexander thought about the people they had questioned in the supermarket and what they had said, feeling inexplicably depressed.

Zoey said, "Why is it called Willowbrook Village? It's a waste of the name. It should be called Primitive Tribe!"

For the first time, Alexander wholeheartedly agreed with Zoey, "You're right. I used to misunderstand you, but it seems I was the one with limited knowledge."

###chapter 92

"Mr. Edwards, do you know less than I do?" Zoey said sarcastically, "It's because you're a man, you can't truly empathize with the feeling of being undervalued as a woman. After all, people always selectively ignore things that don't benefit them."

For the first time, Alexander didn't retort Zoey.

Instead, he seriously considered what she said.

He indeed grew up in a privileged environment, with an older brother. His parents loved him and his brother equally, but as the youngest in the family, he sometimes received a bit more love than his brother.

However, this favoritism was almost imperceptible.

The material support from their parents made them feel valued.

Because whatever they gave to his brother, they also provided for him.

Alexander couldn't help but wonder, if his brother or he were a girl, how would their parents treat them?

He thought about it but couldn't imagine his parents as bad people.

No matter how he thought about it, his parents treated them equally.

Because his family was wealthy, and his mother always expressed that she especially wished he could be a girl.

Favoring males over females didn't exist in their family. But what if they weren't wealthy?

Thinking about being poor, Alexander's gaze instantly fell on Zoey. "Zoey, I remember you have a younger brother, right?"

Zoey didn't know why Derek was brought up again but responded with a yes.

Alexander recalled that he had never heard Zoey mention her family, let alone Derek.

He asked, "So how is your relationship?"

Zoey honestly replied, "Terrible."

Alexander fell silent.

Alexander imagined Zoey as his sister, and he probably wouldn't get along with her either. With her personality, being her brother... he didn't even dare to continue thinking about it.

He thought his reasoning was successful and said, "It's normal for siblings to have conflicts. You must have had happy times growing up, right?"

Zoey didn't answer his question.

Instead, she asked him, "Do you know that most families with a brother-sister combination favor males over females?"

Alexander was stunned by Zoey's gaze.

He had never heard of this, but he vaguely understood from Zoey's words that her family might be like this.

He connected this with recent investigations, all favoring males over females.

So, could Zoey's prickly personality be related to growing up in a family that favored males over females?

But it didn't make sense.

Generally, children who lacked love were insecure and gradually developed a people-pleasing personality. But looking at Zoey's irritable personality, she seemed more like someone who was spoiled growing up.

Thinking this, they unknowingly arrived at the church entrance.

Robert and a few others were standing at the entrance, looking at their phones with serious expressions.

Alexander and Zoey walked up to them, and no one spoke.

Alexander took the initiative to speak, "Officer Davis, has the autopsy report come in?"

Robert was so engrossed that he didn't notice Alexander until he spoke. He looked up at Alexander, "You're back? How did it go? The autopsy report is in our group chat, didn't you see it?"

Alexander and Zoey both took out their phones, and opened the group chat.

Alexander had just received it, but Zoey's group chat had no new messages.

Alexander said, "I just received it; the signal here is terrible."

Zoey walked around looking for a signal with her old phone, but no matter where she went, the group chat messages remained the same, with no updates.

Impatient, she moved closer to Alexander to look at his phone together.

Alexander placed his phone in a central position so they could both see.

Apart from the ligature marks on the neck, the three bodies had no obvious external injuries. The lips, cheeks, earlobes, nail beds, hands, feet, and lower parts of the body showed significant cyanosis; the facial skin and conjunctiva had petechial hemorrhages; the livor mortis was prominent and appeared early, indicating that the cause of death for the three victims was mechanical asphyxia, specifically hanging.

There were no ligature marks on the hands, and the ligature marks on the neck extending to the back of the ears were clean and singular, indicating that there were no signs of struggle when they were hanged, likely because the killer hanged them while they were unconscious. However, the forensic pathologist did not detect any drugs in the victims' bodies.

But it couldn't be ruled out that the victims were given a small amount of sedatives, and the killer waited for the drugs to metabolize before hanging them.

Most notably, the forensic pathologist found semen residues in all three victims, but since the vaginal openings had not returned to their original state and there were no signs of sexual activity, the forensic pathologist determined that the victims were raped before being killed.

Strangely, only in Faye's body were two types of semen found. The forensic pathologist determined through activity testing that one type of sperm entered the victim's body about 20 hours earlier than the other.

As for fingerprints, due to the excessive number of fingerprints found on the three victims, they wouldn't be detailed here. The forensic team would match them after collecting fingerprints from the villagers. The known autopsy results were as above.

Every sentence of the autopsy report was like a sharp blade piercing the hearts of the entire criminal investigation team.

They were just young girls who had barely seen the world outside the village, cruelly murdered by the killer!

Alexander, usually very composed, trembled as he held his phone. "What a scum of society!"

Dennis was also furious, his tone filled with indignation for the victims. "Why doesn't our country have laws? For rapists of young girls, they should all be chemically castrated! Then executed! They shouldn't live!"

Robert sighed deeply but didn't express any opinion.

He had seen too many such cases, and each time he was extremely angry. He turned his anger into motivation to solve the case, to avenge the girls as soon as possible.

Jordan said, "The forensic pathologist only found two types of semen in Faye's body, one of which is the same as in Janet and Sadie. The different one entered the body the day before the incident, so we can't determine if there are two killers."

"It seems this killer has no anti-detection awareness, leaving such crucial evidence!" Alexander said, "At this time, the men working in the village should be back, right? Let's move!"

"Alright, you go ahead. I'll wait here for the technical team to come back. I'll join you once they're here to guard the crime scene, I'll join you." Robert finished, and the group quickly left the church.

Zoey, Alexander, and Jordan formed a team to collect samples from each household starting from the village entrance.

###chapter 93

Dennis and Charles started from the end of the village.

According to the list compiled by Willowbrook Village, they didn't miss a single household.

The first criminal investigation team began their operation.

Alexander connected the fingerprint scanner and quickly created a simple form to record their names.

Jordan brought over a large box of saliva collection kits from the technicians.

They began collecting fingerprints and DNA.

Fortunately, most of the villagers were quite cooperative.

Their collection operation proceeded very quickly.

Compared to the collection, they were more curious about the progress of the case. Almost every villager they encountered would ask, "Have you found the killer? Who is the killer?"

Some enthusiastic villagers even wanted to invite them for a meal, but the police declined.

In less than an hour, they had checked most of the villagers' homes.

They thought the night would go smoothly, but they were interrupted by an uncooperative family.

A few of them entered a house, just like the previous ones they had visited. This house was noticeably better than the others.

Jordan couldn't help but wonder, "Could this be the village chief's house?"

If it was the village chief's house, it would be a key target for investigation.

At least it had some connection to Janet.

They all walked in together, and Zoey knocked on the door. A woman wearing an apron opened the door.

She didn't look very old, probably over twenty-five, and she was quite attractive, though a bit shy. Seeing the sudden arrival of several strangers, she seemed a bit uneasy and asked, "Who are you?"

Zoey took out her police badge, "Detectives from the city police department, here to investigate a murder case in Willowbrook Village. We need your cooperation."

"Ah? De-detectives? I..." The woman was visibly nervous upon hearing Zoey's identity.

Her eyes darted around as if seeking approval.

A male voice quickly came from inside, "What are you dawdling for? Who's here?"

"Honey, it's the cop. They said they need our cooperation. Can we let them in?"

The man inside paused for a second and replied, "Let them in."

The woman responded and fully opened the door, revealing a bright courtyard, and invited them in.

Their house was the most luxuriously decorated in Willowbrook Village. Although it looked like a bungalow, the interior was decorated more like a city apartment.

The large living room and kitchen were connected.

As soon as they entered, they saw a table full of people eating. Seeing strangers who didn't belong to Willowbrook Village, they all stopped what they were doing and looked over.

"Are cops this young now?" The voice came from the woman's husband.

They looked in the direction of the voice. The woman's husband looked like a nouveau riche, with a big belly stretching his clothes, looking almost pregnant, and his face was shiny with oil, completely mismatched with his wife.

Just from the age difference, he could almost be her father.

The man observed them for a moment and finally focused on Zoey, "And there's a woman. Women can be cops now? Looks like I could become a cop too."

"Sure, we would definitely support you becoming a cop!" Several slightly younger men across from him echoed.

They completely ignored the police and got more and more excited.

The woman beside them kept urging them to lower their voices, and they finally shut up.

Zoey's gaze instinctively fell on the man who was causing a commotion.

She wasn't one to insult, but this man looked quite abnormal, as if he had some mental issues.

Jordan looked at the big-bellied man and asked, "Are you the village chief?"

The big-bellied man took a sip of wine, completely disregarding them, acting as if he were the king of the village.

"I'm the village chief's eldest son. My name is Hugh Wright. My dad won't be back until next month. This is my brother, Evan Wright. He's very handsome, isn't he? Though not as handsome as me, haha." He narcissistically praised himself and introduced his mother and wife.

Zoey really wanted him to take a good look at himself in the mirror!

Hugh's mother, Talulah Adams, had a typically sharp and mean face.

The only one who looked kind was Hugh's wife, who had opened the door for them.

Talulah completely ignored their arrival and continued urging Evan to eat more.

After ignoring Zoey and the others for a few seconds, she finally asked reluctantly, "It's late at night, what do you want? Just say it quickly."

Alexander explained their purpose, "We need to collect fingerprints and DNA from all the villagers. Please cooperate, and we'll leave once we're done."

"Fingerprints and DNA?" Hugh quickly said, "How can that be? Those are personal privacy. What if you use our privacy to do bad things?"

"We're cops. How could we use your fingerprints to do bad things? Besides, we don't have the ability to use your fingerprints to do bad things." Alexander patiently explained, "This is to match..."

Before he finished, Zoey interrupted firmly, "It's for population statistics! Three girls have died in the village. To rule out the possibility of hidden victims and ensure the basic safety of Willowbrook Village, we need to collect basic information from every villager to ensure safety for every household."

Alexander was puzzled.

Jordan looked around in disbelief, trying to confirm with others.

What was Zoey talking about?

Not only did Zoey's colleagues not understand, but the whole family in the village didn't understand either.

After a while, Hugh nodded, "Well. You should have said so earlier! My dad told me a long time ago that everyone in the village needs to be collected for safety."

Upon hearing this, Talulah also understood, "My husband told me about it, but you guys came too late. Three people are already dead, and you're just coming now!"

Zoey gave a fake smile, "Yes, we came late."

She turned and gave Alexander and Jordan a look, "What are you standing there for? Get started!"

Alexander and Jordan quickly reacted and began collecting their fingerprints and DNA.

Everything went very smoothly.

When it was Talulah's turn, Jordan asked curiously, "I see you have two excellent sons. They speak more eloquently than other men in the village. Where do they work now?"

Talulah's confidence instantly soared upon hearing this.

###chapter 94

Talulah said, "You have a good eye for people. Hugh runs a big factory, and there are so many workers. If you ever can't continue with your police job, remember to find me. I can introduce you to work there."

Jordan remained silent.

He endured the humiliation and continued to ask, "Hugh is really excellent. That's something I could never achieve in my lifetime. What about Evan?"

At the mention of Evan, the spirited expression on Talulah's face disappeared without a trace.

Evan looked foolish to anyone who saw him.

By asking this, he was clearly insulting her.

After thinking for a moment, she replied, "Of course, he's helping Hugh."

"They're all very impressive," Jordan praised as he looked at Talulah.

"Of course, my sons must be outstanding."

Jordan cheerfully finished collecting the information and left the village chief's house with them.

They hadn't walked far when Jordan couldn't contain his curiosity any longer. He turned and asked, "Zoey, what did you mean by all that you said earlier?"

"What?"

"The part about security measures. I didn't quite understand."

Zoey suddenly realized and said, "Oh, that was to prevent Hugh and the others from being uncooperative. People like him, whether they're smart or not, won't put themselves in a disadvantageous position. Whether they're the culprits or not, as long as you say it's to find the culprit's DNA, they'll feel inexplicably guilty."

Jordan blinked, not sure if he understood, "Oh, I think I've encountered people like that before."

"But didn't the villagers say that the village chief's son Evan had a thing for Janet?" Alexander said, "We just brought up the case in front of them, and they didn't ask a single question."

Jordan said, "I think it's normal. Didn't the information you gathered say it was Renee's one-sided affection? The two of them had no feelings for each other."

Zoey added, "But Evan is a fool."

Hearing that, Alexander and Jordan fell silent.

Jordan instinctively looked around and, seeing that there was almost no one on the road at this time, finally felt relieved. "He may not seem smart, but you shouldn't say such things in public."

"Why?" Zoey asked, puzzled.

Jordan explained, "You guys are from the big city and don't know how backward this small place is. Take Willowbrook Village, for example. They may seem cooperative with us now, but if we offend any of their people, they'll unite to drive us away."

The others were puzzled.

Jordan continued, "Remember those cases of women and children being trafficked? Our chief had to personally come to take them away. Otherwise, the villagers would have thrown stones at our car, refusing to let us take them. You should be careful with your words. If these people go crazy, even police warnings won't work."

Zoey roughly understood.

The barren mountains and harsh environment easily breed difficult and uncooperative people.

Alexander thought of the women they had met earlier who seemed very fearful when mentioning the village chief's house. It must be for this reason.

They didn't want to reveal the village's secrets to outsiders.

Offending the village chief would make it impossible for them to stay here.

Combining this with what Jordan said, everything made sense.

Alexander and Zoey instinctively exchanged glances, and then Jordan seriously continued, "My hometown also has people like Evan. They weren't born with brain problems; it was a fever that damaged their brains later on. Evan is probably the latter."

Zoey asked, "Could someone like Evan commit murder?"

Jordan replied, "I'm not sure. I can't say for certain, but their minds are chaotic. They don't have the concept of killing someone, but they can kill." If the victim kept provoking him, he might do this.

The case seemed to be paused by an invisible hand.

The three of them finished collecting the information, which took over an hour.

Then they successfully reunited with Dennis and Robert.

They organized the collected information and handed it over to the technical staff.

Then, they returned to their car to rest.

Zoey had been busy from morning till night without eating anything. She didn't feel it while working, but once she stopped, her stomach hurt badly.

She sat in the back, frantically searching for something to eat in the car, not caring if it was expired, and stuffed it into her mouth.

Seeing Zoey's pitiful state, Robert felt a bit sorry for her and said, "Why don't we go down the mountain, find a place to eat, and then find a place to stay? We can come back tomorrow."

Since Robert had spoken, everyone immediately nodded without hesitation.

Seeing his team members like this, Robert had no choice but to shake his head and smile helplessly in the rearview mirror.

It was too dark now, and they were on the mountain.

So Robert drove very slowly down the mountain.

As they drove away from Willowbrook Village, there were no more houses, only forests.

Accompanied by the howling wind, the trees in the forest swayed continuously. It was particularly terrifying.

"This place is perfect for shooting a horror movie," Robert said. Zoey leaned back in her seat, resting with her eyes closed.

Robert's description formed a movie scene in her mind, and she said, "In horror movies, a ghost usually appears halfway, jumps onto our car, and reaches out with bloody hands."

Robert and Alexander fell silent.

"Zoey is really good at telling stories." Robert didn't believe in such things, but at that moment, he felt a bit scared by Zoey's words.

His fear hadn't dissipated when his phone vibrated in his pocket.

"Who's calling?" Robert focused on the road ahead and asked Alexander to help him take out the phone. "Check who's calling."

"Okay." Alexander took the phone out of his pocket, seeing it was a long string of internet numbers.

Following Robert's instructions, he answered the call, and a sales pitch came through. "It's a sales call, Officer Davis."

Robert responded, "Hang up."

The sales call conveniently interrupted Zoey's story. Robert drove for a while longer before spotting some lights.

The car transitioned from the mountain road to the city streets.

An unprecedented sense of security enveloped them.

Robert checked the time. It was just 8:30 PM, not too late.

There were still many restaurants open in the town. Robert parked the car in front of a relatively large-looking restaurant. "How about this one?"

"Sure."

###chapter 95

Being able to have a meal was already quite good, they were not picky at all.

After getting out of the car, a few people quickly entered the shop.

When Zoey passed by the entrance, she saw a black kitten tied next to the barbecue shop, with an iron bowl used for rural dogs placed in front of it, which was already empty.

The kitten was lazily lying there, with the chain around its neck being the most noticeable.

Zoey suddenly thought of Big Baby, which was so well taken care of by Lucille. Whatever it wanted to eat, Lucille would buy it, but this cat looked dirty and couldn't get anything good to eat, just having some leftovers.

Truly, the same cats but with different fates.

Alexander noticed Zoey standing at the door and asked, "Not coming in?"

"Coming."

They quickly ordered a table full of delicious dishes, including some barbecue.

At first, everyone was focused on eating, and no one spoke.

When they had almost finished eating, Charles slowly spoke, "Officer Davis, I haven't been on the job for long, but this is the first time I've felt uncomfortable. Since I entered Willowbrook Village, I've felt something was off, but I don't know why."

Dennis took a bite of food and said, "Isn't that right? I felt the same way. Guess what kind of family we met tonight? While collecting fingerprints, we met a man who had lost his wife. He was working with several children around him, one holding his hand and another on his back."

"What's so special about that?" Charles eagerly joined the conversation, "His eldest daughter is only ten years old, carrying another child on her back. She has to work and cook for her father, while he lies on the sofa drinking and playing on his phone. I really..."

Jordan, having experienced more, was not as angry, "There are many such families. The hardworking wife dies, leaving behind three daughters. The son is a bit better off. Here, daughters are no different from maids, continuing to serve their father in place of their mother."

Zoey sneered, "They deserve it, they are quite capable."

Hearing this from a woman like Zoey, the other men looked over, "What capability do they have?"

"They are lucky to be born in a village that favors males over females. No matter the family situation, as long as they marry a wife, they are the head of the household, their word is law, and no one dares to oppose them. They are fortunate to be born as men. The women in the village, from the moment their daughters are born, are constantly told that they are burdens. No girl grows up with encouragement from her mother, but rather with suppression, deeply ingrained male superiority, and female inferiority! They never consider their own issues, and their servility is displayed vividly in them, making their daughters suffer even more. Aren't such people deserving of their fate?"

"So, in conclusion, isn't it what those men deserve?"

After Zoey expressed her views, everyone at the table fell silent.

"It's all caused by decayed thoughts, coupled with the lack of cultural understanding in rural areas. The tragedy of the children is not only due to ignorant parents but also the environment."

From birth, they grow up in such an environment. No one could change them.

As Zoey said, it was a deeply ingrained thought.

It was not something that could be explained in a few words.

Charles said, "If all the women in the village could complete basic education, would it be different?"

Zoey replied, "Do you think they don't want to? But they are not allowed."

"Is it really that poor?"

"It's not because of poverty." Zoey already knew the reason, "They don't let women go to school, not because of poverty, but because they realize the benefits of uneducated women, who are willing to endure and sacrifice for the family. If they had knowledge and correct values, do you think a normal woman would live with such men?"

Zoey had visited almost every household in Willowbrook Village, finding all the men were the same.

No normal woman would be interested in such men.

Only uneducated women would obey these men.

"Fuck, it's so disgusting!" Dennis cursed.

Jordan also expressed his opinion, "It's so speechless that I just want to curse!"

After dinner, it was already past ten.

They found a relatively clean hotel to stay in.

Robert looked at everyone and confirmed the rooms. "The four of us will stay in a four-person room, and we'll get single rooms for Jordan and Zoey."

Jordan said, "No need to trouble yourself, Officer Davis, I can share a room with Zoey."

Everyone was puzzled.

Charles directly refused on Zoey's behalf, "No! Zoey is a girl, don't you understand?"

Jordan blinked, "Why not?"

"Fine, then share a room with me, we can save some money," Zoey said, and everyone was stunned again.

Especially Alexander, who strongly refused Jordan and Zoey sharing a room, "No, even if you are colleagues and have a pure relationship, you can't share a room!"

Zoey looked at Jordan and said, "Don't make a fuss, she's a girl."

Everyone was shocked again.

Jordan then realized, " Did I forget to tell you? I am indeed a girl."

The members of the criminal investigation team were stunned by this explosive news, their minds seemingly losing the ability to think.

"You're actually a girl?" Dennis really hadn't noticed, "I've always treated you as a guy."

Charles chimed in, "Me too!"

Robert recalled all the details of his first meeting with Jordan and indeed didn't remember her mentioning it.

Alexander was momentarily embarrassed, then smiled politely, "Sorry, Ms. Taylor."

Mainly because of her appearance, dress, and particularly masculine voice,

It was impossible to associate her with the word woman.

Jordan quickly waved her hand, "It's okay, I'm used to it. What does it matter if my personality is male or female? Just call me Jordan. It's my fault for not telling you, causing the misunderstanding, it's my problem."

As the team leader, Robert quickly apologized on behalf of the criminal investigation team, "No, who introduces their gender when meeting someone? It's our problem. We formally apologize, but we really didn't mean anything by it, please understand."

###chapter 96

"It's really okay." Jordan curiously looked at Zoey, "But, Zoey, how did you figure out I was a girl?"

Zoey said expressionlessly, "Because I accidentally saw you changing your sanitary pad."

So that was how it was.

Zoey's answer made Jordan a bit shy, "Zoey, you observe very carefully."

After clearing up this misunderstanding, they took their respective room cards and went to their corresponding rooms.

Since there was no elevator in this small town, they had to climb the stairs together.

Everyone was talking about the deceased Faye and Sadie's names, and suddenly they started talking about their own names.

Their names weren't particularly special, and after everyone had spoken, it was Zoey's turn to explain the meaning of her name.

She remained indifferent, as if she had no interest in anything.

Alexander remembered that she had mentioned growing up in a family that favored males over females and kindly tried to help her out, "I think the name Zoey is quite nice."

Robert also agreed, "I think Zoey's name sounds nice too."

Zoey was silent for a few seconds and then responded lightly, "I chose my name with my teacher in middle school."

"With your middle school teacher?" Everyone stopped in confusion and looked at Zoey, waiting for her next sentence.

Zoey and Jordan were walking at the back. She originally didn't want to bring this up again.

Seeing that they all wanted to know the reason, she said indifferently, "My original name was Pat. I didn't like that name."

Everyone fell silent.

Alexander was also stunned.

They had known each other for years, and Zoey had never mentioned this.

"But when I turned 18, I changed my name," Zoey added.

Robert could almost see from Zoey's description of her tragic childhood and said sympathetically, "You changed it to Zoey? Zoey is a very nice name."

Jordan, standing beside, said, "Zoey, when you changed your name, didn't your parents hit you?"

"They did, so what? I didn't die." Zoey replied.

Charles curiously asked, "Why did you change it to Zoey?"

"Because my teacher told me that if I changed my name, he would take care of my meals."

Robert couldn't help but praise, "What a good teacher."

"Yes, very good."

Alexander couldn't understand. Was this the reason Zoey gave herself? Why would changing her name mean she could get meals from her teacher?

He recalled the days spent with Zoey, and how she ate, completely unlike the image of a typical girl.

Could it be that because her family favored males over females, they didn't give her food?

Alexander didn't dare to think further, hoping it wasn't the case.

No one asked any more questions, afraid of touching on Zoey's sad topics.

They then each went back to their rooms.

Zoey and Jordan entered the same room, took turns washing their faces, and lay down on the bed.

They started chatting, and Jordan said first, "Although my family also favored males over females, luckily they didn't have a third child. Otherwise, my sister and I might have had a harder time. I have a deep understanding of this. If you don't have money, don't have children. That's my plan for the future."

"That's pretty good," Zoey replied.

Jordan asked her, "How many children are in your family?"

"Two."

"That's not bad. Most families can afford two children. They should have bought you similar things."

Zoey said, "They usually prioritize the boy."

"True. How's your relationship with your brother? I get along well with my sister."

Zoey said, "Terrible. I wish he were dead, and he wishes I were dead."

"Oh, you must have had a hard time."

"It was hard, but I made it harder for him."

Jordan asked, "How did you do that?"

"By hitting him, cursing him, and insulting him."

"Wouldn't your parents be angry? They already preferred the son. If you misbehave, wouldn't they dislike you even more?"

"Doesn't matter." After all, she didn't like those people who couldn't even be called her family.

As they chatted, they fell asleep without realizing it.

The next morning, everyone woke up early.

The villagers of Willowbrook Village had to go to the fields at five or six in the morning.

To not delay their progress or their own, Robert had sent a message to the technical department the night before, asking them to send the test report first thing in the morning.

With everyone in the village, if a murderer was hiding among them, they could catch them.

As soon as Robert woke up, the test report was sent over.

He immediately shared it in their criminal investigation team's group chat.

Zoey, used to waking up at the slightest movement in the dormitory, heard her phone vibrate and slowly opened her eyes.

Yawning, she picked up her phone.

The test report appeared before her eyes, and she eagerly clicked on it.

Skipping the professional jargon, she quickly scrolled down to the important conclusion: Numerous fingerprints were found on the three bodies, both male and female, too mixed to serve as direct evidence. The key was the semen test results found in their bodies.

Semen sample A found only in Faye matched a man named Chad Lopez.

Semen sample B found in all three victims matched Hugh.

Zoey had no impression of Chad.

She could remember almost everyone she had interacted with.

Chad's sample should have been collected by Charles and Dennis.

But she remembered Hugh vividly. The face that made her nauseous just thinking about it almost made Zoey retch.

Having gotten the results, she nudged Jordan beside her, "Wake up, Jordan."

She nudged Jordan several times before Jordan groggily opened her eyes, "What time is it?"

"Just past four."

"So early." Hearing the time, Jordan closed her eyes again, "I'll get up later..."

"The test results are out. We need to catch the murderer."

"Catching the murderer?" Hearing this, Jordan instantly became alert, "Who is it?"

She asked while getting dressed.

Zoey was on the phone, "Wait a minute, let me call Officer Davis first."

"Okay."

At 4:10 AM, the criminal investigation team gathered.

They didn't have time for breakfast, bought something quickly, and rushed to Willowbrook Village.

"Thinking about Chad makes me want to hit him! Having three kids served him, and he has a daughter himself, yet he still raped others! I'll definitely sneak a few kicks at him to vent my anger!"

###chapter 97

Charles took a sip of his soy milk in the car. "I don't get it. Chad's DNA was found on the victim a day before the incident. Wasn't Faye still okay then?"

"What's there to figure out?" Robert slammed his hand on the table, clearly frustrated. "Chad must've raped Faye. She is young and has never left the village. He probably scared her into submission. Damn, rapist!"

Zoey's mind was more on the village chief's family than Chad's.

In another police car, Alexander held a sandwich but hesitated to take a bite. "If Hugh's the killer, he must've known Janet was someone Evan was interested in, right?"

Jordan looked puzzled. "But even if Hugh's greasy and overweight, he couldn't have easily overpowered three seventeen or eighteen-year-old girls. Rural girls are strong from working on farms; they're not weaker than boys."

Zoey stuffed food into her mouth, worried today would be as busy as yesterday.

She analyzed while eating voraciously, "Could Hugh have tricked them into working for him, then drugged them with a sedative before raping them?"

"That's the most realistic theory!" Jordan agreed, looking at Zoey. "Don't forget, Hugh runs a factory. Just being the boss would make the victims trust him without question."

Alexander, however, wasn't entirely convinced. "Why would he kill them and dump the bodies in the village church if he's the factory owner? Wouldn't it be safer to lure them out and kill them elsewhere? Reporting them as missing would be less risky than a murder investigation."

Zoey looked at the nearly finished breakfast she had bought.

She reached for another sandwich but stopped herself. "Why don't you guys eat something? Aren't you tired of talking non-stop?"

The others were speechless.

The car pulled back into Willowbrook Village around 5:10 AM.

The six of them split up as they had the day before.

Alexander's group headed to the village chief's house, while the other three went to Chad's.

When Zoey's group arrived, smoke was already rising from the village chief's chimney.

They could hear voices from inside the courtyard, though faint.

The three exchanged glances, and Alexander cautiously knocked on the door, but there was no response.

He knocked again, harder this time.

Soon, the door opened.

A woman recognized the distinguished-looking Alexander immediately. "You're the officers from yesterday?" She looked at them with a mix of confusion and fear. "Sorry, is there something you need?"

Unlike yesterday, she didn't even dare to open the door fully. "My husband and his mother are still sleeping... Could you keep it down?"

"Sure, no problem," Alexander replied softly. "We just need to ask your husband a few questions."

"What about? Can't you ask me?" The woman spoke nervously, glancing inside the house, afraid they might wake her husband.

"Could you come back in an hour? They should be awake by then..."

"Maybe we could wait yesterday, but not today," Zoey said in her normal voice, startling Hugh's wife.

"Please, don't be so loud... Officer."

Zoey had no patience for a rapist and murderer.

She pushed the woman aside effortlessly, like moving a feather.

Before Hugh's wife could react, they were inside.

"Officer, you can't do this..." She couldn't stop them.

They quickly moved from the courtyard to the main hall.

The house wasn't big, and the bedrooms were easy to find.

Zoey kicked open a door, finding it unlocked.

Inside, a large back was exposed from under the covers, snoring loudly.

The room's sweat smell made Zoey pinch her nose and step back. "Alexander, this one."

Alexander glanced inside and woke Hugh.

Zoey and Jordan went to wake Hugh's mother and Evan.

In less than five minutes, the whole family, except the absent village chief, was sitting at the table.

Hugh yawned, looking like he hadn't slept enough.

Hugh's wife brought breakfast to the table, her frail figure trembling.

Seeing his wife, Hugh's anger flared. "Who told you to open the door for them?" He shouted.

His wife trembled, nearly dropping the breakfast tray. "I-I couldn't stop them..."

Zoey had no sympathy for Hugh. "Do we have to wait for you to wake up to do our job?" She was indirectly standing up for Hugh's wife.

Hugh's wife didn't dare lift her head, standing aside like she had done something wrong.

Evan, oblivious to the situation, kept eating breakfast, praising Hugh's wife's cooking.

Hugh, feeling the pressure of their stares, snapped, "It's five in the morning. Can I at least ask why you're here? What's so urgent?"

"You know why," Zoey replied with a smile that was more terrifying than a frown.

Alexander let Hugh eat, knowing the investigation in Willowbrook Village would take time.

If Hugh was indeed the killer, they'd need him to identify the crime scenes, and they wouldn't have time to feed him.

Hugh sipped his porridge, losing his appetite.

Compared to his aggressive behavior last night, he seemed much more subdued now.

After breakfast, Alexander signaled for Hugh's family to come with them.

"We have work to do. Can't you question us here?" Hugh's mother said arrogantly. "Hugh is a big boss. If you delay his work, you'll have to compensate for our factory's losses! Can you afford that on your police salaries?"

Alexander chuckled sarcastically. "Really, a big boss?" He looked Hugh up and down. "Fine, Mr. Wright, you will be the first to be questioned. No objections, right?"

###chapter 98

Hugh lifted his head with a sneer, looking at the group without a clue about the seriousness of the situation.

His arrogance was clear, showing off his sense of superiority at every chance.

"Well, you all show up at my place first thing in the morning. What's this got to do with us? Even regular jobs start at eight, right?"

The cops stood at the factory gate like statues, staring him down.

A weird pressure settled over Hugh.

But he kept up his sarcastic tone, "You guys must have it rough. How much do you make a month? If it's not enough, come work for me. I could use a few security guards."

Zoey was about to step forward, but Alexander quickly held her back.

Alexander stepped up with a slight smile, "We can't compare our paychecks to a big boss like you. We're questioning everyone in Willowbrook Village, and since this is the village chief's house, we had to start here. You get it, right? Plus, we know you have a business to run, so we came early to avoid messing up your day."

Hugh, hearing this, sarcastically praised Alexander for his thoughtfulness. "Not bad, you got potential. If you ever can't hack it in the police force, come work for me."

Alexander smiled, though it seemed fake to others, but Hugh and his mother seemed to like him.

Hugh's mother also smiled and said, "Since the cop said so, you should go early and not delay your work."

Hugh, seeing his mother speak, responded, "Alright, Mom, I got it. I'll go now." He stuffed a large bite of his sandwich into his mouth.

Only Evan was eating, enjoying his meal, shoveling food into his mouth.

Hugh's mother was helping him, and when Evan finished, he yawned and stood up, "Mom, I want to go back to my room and sleep."

"Alright," Hugh's mother agreed.

But the police weren't planning to let Evan go.

People like him were more likely to slip up.

Alexander stepped forward with a smile, "Ma'am, he needs to come too, to help us with our work."

"He needs to go? Why?" Hugh's mother was highly alert, her actions and expressions showing strong disapproval.

It was clear Evan had some intellectual disabilities.

Even though Hugh's mother was from the countryside, she knew that they could get much from a simpleton.

To be safe, she whispered something in Evan's ear, and he nodded enthusiastically.

"Why does my brother need to go? Can't you see he has the intelligence of an eight or nine-year-old? What do you expect to hear from him? If he misleads your investigation, we won't be responsible," Hugh said, turning to his mother, "Right, Mom?"

Hugh's mother could only agree, "Yes, that fever almost took Evan's life..." She sighed like a worried mother.

Hugh said, "Mom, you stay with him. I'll go with them and be back soon."

"Okay," Hugh's mother nodded and led Evan to his room.

"Let him come along. It's a shame to keep him cooped up inside every day. Don't worry, we won't do anything to him," Zoey said, leading the way out of Hugh's house.

Hugh and Evan followed behind.

"Why do you have to bring Evan? What can he understand?" Hugh was getting annoyed, but seeing the police's determination, he shouted to his mom, "Fine, bring him along! Let's get this over with, I have work to do."

"Alright." Hugh's mother quickly grabbed a jacket for Evan and let him follow.

Alexander led the way.

Hugh and the others followed behind.

Willowbrook Village wasn't big, and the church was centrally located, so they arrived quickly.

Robert was in a small room next to the church's main hall, interrogating Chad. He told Alexander to wait in another room.

Hugh peeked into the small room, trying to see who was being interrogated.

But everything was blocked, and he couldn't see anything.

"You educated folks sure know how to talk. Am I not the first one? How long do I have to wait?" Hugh asked impatiently.

"We won't keep you from work," Jordan replied, even more impatient.

Hugh finally shut his mouth.

Zoey was curious about the interrogation. She tried to eavesdrop, but the door opened just as she approached.

Robert came out, his face burning with anger.

He turned to Dennis, who was holding a stranger, and instructed, "Take him out of Willowbrook Village and lock him up at the town police station!"

Zoey looked past Robert and saw Chad.

She had only heard about him from colleagues, thinking he was as disgusting as Hugh. But Chad was different.

He wasn't fat, but extremely thin.

His dark circles were intense, and his face looked like he was on drugs, lifeless and dull.

"Got it!" Dennis had been itching to rough up Chad.

He deliberately tightened his grip, making Chad yelp in pain.

Maybe it was the pain, or the silver handcuffs counting his sins, but Chad suddenly felt real fear.

Chad, who had been calm, suddenly panicked, "No... I can't be taken in... I have three kids at home. If they lose me, they'll lose their only family. I... can't be in trouble."

Charles, used to seeing people like this, scoffed, "Disgusting. Now you think of your kids? Why didn't you think of them when you were doing bad things? And what about the kids you hurt? Your kids will be better off without you. They won't have to take care of you anymore!"

Chad hung his head in shame.

Robert, seeing this, felt Chad didn't deserve to be called a father, and shouted, "Stop wasting time, take him away!"

"Yes!" Dennis tightened his grip again and led Chad away.

Robert then noticed Zoey and the others had returned, and asked, "Are they here?"

###chapter 99

Zoey pointed to a small room nearby. "Everyone's here except the mayor."

"Let's start with Hugh!" Robert said, turning back to the makeshift interrogation room. Just as he was about to enter, he remembered something and glanced at Charles. "Oh, Charles, Chad won't be out for a while. Can you check if he has any close relatives around? We need to figure out what to do with the kid."

"Got it, I'll handle it now."

With Dennis and Charles gone, it meant Zoey could join in on the interrogation.

When it was Hugh's turn, he was still putting on airs.

He found a comfortable position on the chair, lounging as he looked at the two cops across from him. "Let's get this over with, officers."

"Name," Robert demanded, his tone sharp and serious.

"Hugh. Didn't you already get that down? It's clearly written on your records," Hugh replied, a hint of annoyance in his voice.

Robert didn't give him any leeway. "Answer what you're asked, no extra nonsense!"

Seeing that Robert wasn't someone to mess with, Hugh's attitude softened a bit. "Officer, I have things to do. Can we speed this up? I'm running out of time."

"Age."

"44. I look young, don't I? People always say I look like I'm in my twenties."

Robert, who had been ignoring him, looked up and couldn't help but chuckle.

"What's so funny?"

"Nothing." Robert stifled his laughter and got straight to the point. "The villagers, including Janet's mother, told us Evan was supposed to get married. Is that right?"

"Yes, but what's that got to do with anything?"

"You should know who Evan was supposed to marry."

"How would I know? I'm busy with the factory all day. My wife handles the household stuff, and my mom deals with Evan's matters. I don't have time to meddle in his affairs," Hugh replied, sounding impatient, as if he wanted to brush off the matter quickly.

"Evan is your little brother, and you don't know who he is marrying." Robert clearly didn't buy it. He observed Hugh's expression closely and continued, "Do you know Janet? The whole village knew Evan was supposed to marry Janet. You didn't?"

Hugh's face showed a flicker of panic, his brows furrowing deeply. But he quickly regained his composure, pretending it had nothing to do with him. "Janet? I really didn't know... But if it was her, and she's dead now... Evan's life is just too tragic. Brain damage from a fever as a kid, and now his fiancée dies..."

"Do you interact with Janet often?" Robert added.

Hugh quickly distanced himself. "I'm busy and only come home every few days. We might pass each other on the road, but that's it. No other interactions."

"No interactions at all?" Robert confirmed.

"Right, I don't know her. We're too far apart in age to be friends. I really don't know her."

"Good!" Robert had been waiting for this. The interrogation had been recorded from the start.

Robert asked directly, "Then explain why the cops found your semen in Janet's body." He showed Hugh the test report. "Not just her, but in two other victims as well."

"What? That's impossible! Are you framing me?" Hugh didn't even look at the report, immediately flying into a rage.

He stood up abruptly, trying to use his loud voice to cover his guilt.

"We cops don't frame innocent people," Robert said calmly, watching Hugh's every move. "We're giving you a chance to explain. Why so agitated?"

Hugh's chest heaved with anger, his heavy breathing audible. He continued to argue, "Where did you get that report? Are you trying to trick me because you have no evidence? I'm telling you, it wasn't me! If you wrongfully accuse me, I'll fight you to the end!"

"Alright, no need to get so worked up," Robert tried to calm him down, knowing that overweight people often had health issues. If Hugh fainted, the interrogation would be delayed.

Robert kept his cool and asked, "On the night of the incident, the 20th, between 11 PM and 3 AM, where were you? Do you have an alibi?"

"Of course, I was at home sleeping. I have to get up early for work," Hugh said, then quickly corrected himself. "Wait, what date did you say?"

"20th," Robert repeated.

"Right, the 20th. That night I wasn't home. Work was busy, so I went to a bar to relax. I didn't get back until 1 or 2 AM. By then, my wife and everyone else were already asleep."

"Do you have any receipts?"

"Receipts?" Hugh didn't expect them to be so thorough. He stood up again, furious. "Are you really cops? Don't you understand how things work? Do you know who I am? People are eager to treat me. I don't need to pay!"

Robert wasn't fooled by his bluster. He'd seen it all before. "Then give us the contact information of the person who treated you."

"Do I need to have everyone's contact info? That would be beneath my status as a factory manager!"

"So, you don't have it."

"No, they don't deserve my contact info!"

Robert knew he was lying but recorded everything according to protocol.

"Alright, I think I've got most of your statement."

###chapter 100

"No one can back up your alibi, and the timeline of the semen evidence found in the victim's body doesn't rule you out, so..." Robert was about to charge him.

Hugh cut in, "Hold up! I remember the bar I went to. They must have me on camera! Check the Starlit Lounge, go check!"

Zoey pulled out her phone and started searching.

The bar Hugh mentioned was real, but it was over an hour away from Willowbrook Village. Zoey showed the search results to Robert.

Robert nodded, indicating he understood. "We'll look into it."

Hugh sneered, "With our status, we can have any woman we want. Why would we need to rape anyone? Especially someone from the same village. Even if I did rape her, a bit of money would settle it. Why would I kill her? Am I crazy? Or just stupid?"

Zoey stood by, unsure of what to say.

The evidence was solid, yet he was so confident.

The more Hugh bragged, the more Robert wanted to punch him.

His eyes betrayed a hint of rage, though he tried to hide it as a cop. His hand, holding the file, trembled uncontrollably. "Let me confirm again, you don't know Janet, Faye, or Sadie, right?"

"I've seen them around, we live in the same village, but I don't know them well. Like Evan's fiancée, Janet, my mom handled everything about Evan. I really don't know her." Hugh distanced himself from the situation.

Robert saw that Hugh's story remained consistent and knew he wouldn't get more out of him. So there was no need to waste time.

As he gathered his files, he said, "Alright, we've confirmed with you multiple times. Given the decisive evidence linking you to the rape of the victims, you'll be detained at the station. The court will decide based on the evidence."

"What does that mean?" Hugh visibly panicked. "You haven't even checked the bar's footage and you're pinning this on me? Go check it out! I told you it's not me. Are you deaf?"

Zoey watched him lose it, calm and composed. "Until we verify the footage, the evidence we have is enough to detain you. Besides, you said you got home around 1 AM, but the victim died before 3 AM. You had plenty of time to commit the crime."

Hugh slammed his hand on the table, nearly breaking it, and shouted, "I went to the bar, hired two escorts, had sex with them, then drove forty minutes back to kill and rape three women? Am I that capable?"

Bars like that were frequented by men in their forties and fifties.

Everyone knew they were shady, and involved in gray areas.

Hugh's blunt admission was really shameless.

"We arrest based on evidence. Detaining you isn't a conviction. If we find you're innocent, you'll be released immediately, got it?"

"I don't get it! I can't go to jail!" Hugh yelled in defiance.

Robert explained, "This isn't jail, it's just procedure."

"I don't care about your procedure. I'm not going with you! I'm not going to jail!" Hugh finished and tried to leave.

Outside, a male officer with a feminine demeanor stood smiling.

Hugh was already annoyed; this officer had brought him here and now blocked his way.

"Move!"

"I can't. You're a murder suspect. Until the evidence is clear, you have to come with us." Alexander, worried Hugh might hurt Jordan, stepped forward and grabbed Hugh's arm.

He restrained Hugh's impending punch.

"Get off me!" Hugh struggled but couldn't shake Alexander's grip.

Alexander, tired of the struggle, swept Hugh's legs, sending him rolling on the floor.

He quickly pinned Hugh's arms behind his back and cuffed him.

Hugh, much heavier than Alexander, couldn't fight back.

Realizing resistance was futile, Hugh cursed as he was helped up and taken to the police car.

Robert was pleased with Alexander's work. "Next."

Jordan playfully signaled 'OK' and brought out Hugh's wife.

Hugh's wife emerged from a small room, searching for Hugh.

But the church was empty except for the police.

Not finding Hugh, she looked nervous and stammered, "Officer, where's my husband?"

"Don't worry about him. He's fine," Zoey replied.

Hugh's wife replied. "Oh, that's good."

Before the questioning began, Robert and Zoey noticed Hugh's wife seemed overly nervous, almost guilty.

Robert, aware of what students said about Hugh's wife, reassured her, "It's okay, don't be nervous. Just answer our questions honestly. But one thing, no lying, got it?"

Hugh's wife avoided eye contact, head down, but nodded.

"Name."

"Olivia Smith."

"Age."

"22."

Hearing that, Robert looked up at Olivia in surprise.

"Hugh is 44, and you're 22?"

Olivia nodded, head still down. "My mom said to find an older man, mature and stable, who would take care of me..."

Zoey had been to Hugh's house multiple times.

What she saw didn't match Olivia's words.

Zoey couldn't help but speak up, "Hugh takes care of you? Besides cooking, does he treat you well?"

"...No."

Zoey added, "Is he mature and stable?" With his temper, not hitting Olivia was probably the best he could do.

Olivia didn't know how to respond.

Zoey, always blunt, said, "Your mom tricked you, didn't she?"

###chapter 101

Robert felt the conversation was veering off track, so he cleared his throat and continued, "Tell me about you and Hugh. When did you two get married?"

"It's been about four years."

"Four years? You're only 22 now, so you got married right when you turned 18?" Robert could hardly believe it. If it were his daughter in front of him, he couldn't imagine how he'd react. He'd probably lose his mind.

Eighteen was such a wonderful age, meant to be spent in school.

It was the beginning of youth, and it just... got buried?

Robert asked, "Why did you marry Hugh? Did he pursue you, or was it your choice?"

"This marriage was arranged by my parents... In our village, marriages are decided by the parents." Olivia sighed repeatedly, her voice filled with helplessness.

Zoey didn't know how to respond. To her, this was just absurd.

But there was no way around it; they were disconnected from modern society.

Growing up in such a village, and being educated by such a culture, it was ingrained in their souls.

She couldn't save them with just a few words.

So, she couldn't judge Olivia.

Olivia added, "My parents told me Hugh liked me, said I was very gentle and would make a good wife. They were one of the better-off families in the village... I thought it didn't matter who I married, life would be the same, so I agreed."

Zoey asked, "If you had disagreed, would they have forced you?"

"Yes."

"Do you have feelings for Hugh?"

Olivia's voice was slow and uncertain, "I, I don't know. Maybe, maybe a little. We've been together for so long."

Robert silently wrote down his thoughts: "No feelings."

Zoey added, "How does he treat you?"

"He's okay, doesn't let me go hungry, and always brings money home. You saw Hugh's father is old, and Evan is... not right in the head. Hugh supports the whole family."

"I don't mean just giving you money and food."

Olivia still didn't understand, "What do you mean then?"

Robert and Zoey exchanged a look, both coming to the same conclusion: these two had no real feelings for each other, just two people living together.

Robert asked, "Where were you the night before last, on the 20th?"

Olivia didn't hesitate, "At home, cooking and cleaning."

"Did you go to bed around eleven?"

Olivia replied, "Yes, we usually go to bed around nine or ten."

"Do you remember when Hugh came home that night?"

"That night..." Olivia seemed to be thinking hard, "I think he wasn't home when I fell asleep, but he was there when I woke up."

"You didn't notice him coming home at all?"

"No... I wake up very early and work hard all day, so I sleep very deeply."

Robert nodded and made a note.

Olivia asked, confused, "Officer, why are you asking me this?"

Robert looked at the frail Olivia and decided not to beat around the bush, "You must have heard about the three girls who were killed in Willowbrook Village recently, right?"

"Such a big thing, of course I know," Olivia answered, then seemed to realize something, her tone changing, "Officer... do you mean Hugh is involved?"

Robert said, "Yeah. That's why we brought your whole family in this morning. Hugh is a key suspect in this case. We found his DNA on all three victims, so we need your full cooperation in our investigation."

Olivia, despite being from a rural area, was first shocked by the news about Hugh, then started crying.

Robert didn't understand why she was crying.

Their marriage wasn't good to begin with, so why cry?

He looked at Zoey, puzzled.

Zoey took out a pack of tissues and handed it to Olivia, "Alright, stop crying. We don't have much time to waste here."

Robert wanted Zoey to comfort her, not expecting she would do that coldly.

Olivia took the tissues, wiped her tears, and after a few minutes, finally stopped crying.

Robert tried to shift her focus, "Ms. Smith, do you know the three victims?"

"Yes, we're about the same age, and we'd greet each other when we met," Olivia replied.

"How was Hugh's relationship with them? Did he know them?"

"I don't know. He works late every day and doesn't interact much with the villagers... He probably didn't know them, so I don't understand why he would..."

"Does Hugh have any other women outside?"

Olivia said, "I don't know. He doesn't let me check his phone. Officer Brown, do you think he..."

"No, I'm just asking."

Olivia responded softly.

"I have another question," Zoey asked directly, "Do women in your village marry very young, and men marry late?"

"Both men and women marry young," Olivia said, her tearful eyes lifting slowly.

"Then why did Hugh marry you so late?"

"He was married before," Olivia said, "He got married in his twenties, divorced in his thirties, married again, and then married me when he was almost forty."

Robert exclaimed, "What!"

Hugh didn't look like much, how did he manage to marry so many times?

Zoey was shocked, "Hugh always wants his wife to be in her twenties? Does he just replace them when they get older?"

"I don't know. He was already divorced when he married me, I don't know what happened with his exes."

"Does Hugh have any children?" Zoey asked.

"Children? I haven't seen any..." Olivia looked genuinely confused.

Robert felt both anger and pity for her, "Your parents are really something, marrying you off without knowing what kind of person Hugh is? At least they should have found out why he divorced his previous wives! Isn't that what parents are supposed to do?"

Robert's words weren't meant to blame her, but he was furious at her parents.

Did Olivia realize she was treated like a commodity by her parents?

They didn't care who their daughter married, just took the money.

Maybe he spoke too harshly, because Olivia started crying again, "Officer, I really didn't know. My parents told me he would cherish a wife more because he had been married twice. I believed my parents wouldn't lie to me, so I married him."

###chapter 102

Zoey asked, "Do you think Hugh treats you well?"

"He's alright," Olivia replied.

Zoey added, "Are you happier than your friends?"

"I... I don't know..."

"Do you think your parents lied to you?"

Olivia was on the verge of breaking down from Zoey's rapid-fire questions. "I don't know..."

Seeing her tears about to fall, Robert quickly stepped in, "Hey, don't cry. Just tell us what you know about Evan and Janet."

"Them? I don't know much. I don't know why he liked Janet, but he came back insisting on marrying her."

Zoey said, "He stays home all the time. How did he even meet Janet?"

"He does go out. Evan's mom takes him around, visiting neighbors or going to the factory. Because of Hugh, no one dares to speak ill of him at the factory."

"After that day, he kept bugging his mom to arrange the marriage with Janet. I heard Janet's mom agreed right away, and they set the wedding date that same day. His mom went home and started looking for a good date to throw a big wedding for Evan and Janet."

"I was happy at the time. I had met Janet a few times and she seemed nice and kind. I thought we would get along well..." Olivia's eyes showed a hint of regret. "It's such a shame, at such a young age... I can't believe someone could be so cruel! How could anyone harm such a good girl?"

Robert added, "Was Janet home when they went to her house? What was her attitude?"

"No, she was out."

"Do you know Janet refuses to marry Evan?"

Olivia looked confused. "I know she didn't, but her mom had already agreed."

Zoey said, "So she didn't agree herself."

Olivia replied, "Her parents agreed."

Zoey added, "So, her parents are the ones getting married?"

Olivia looked at Zoey, not understanding why she was being so confrontational.

Zoey didn't want to make it hard for her. "Forget it. How's the relationship between Hugh and Evan?"

"They get along great. Even though Hugh is busy with the factory, Evan's needs are always taken care of."After asking all the necessary questions, they let Olivia go.

Robert watched Olivia's frail figure as she left, reflecting on the conversation. "I wonder when people in these mountains will stop thinking this way."

Zoey sighed. "Officer Davis, this is a huge task. It won't be solved overnight. Their outdated beliefs have been passed down for generations. Changing that requires uprooting the entire system!"

It also required them to have incredible willpower.

Robert sighed deeply. He lit a cigarette because of the annoying case, something he rarely did.

"Bring in Hugh's mom," Robert ordered.

"Got it."

When Hugh's mom walked in, she still carried an air of superiority.

She looked at others with scrutiny, disdain, and condescension.

Robert followed protocol. "Name."

"Ava Davis."

"Age."

"Sixty."

Hugh was forty-four, so Ava had him when she was sixteen?

Zoey didn't like Ava, but now she felt a bit of sympathy.

"Ms. Davis, you look quite young. I wouldn't have guessed you're sixty." Robert looked at Ava, feeling conflicted.

Generations of passing down outdated beliefs made them think their way was the only right way.

It was terrifying.

Ava didn't catch the sympathy in Robert's words and proudly responded, "Of course. When life is good, with no worries, I naturally stay young."

"So, your sons are very grateful?"

"Absolutely. Isn't it obvious? Hugh runs a big factory with hundreds of employees. Evan is very obedient, and Olivia is very sensible. Life is great."

"Sounds like a good life." Robert squinted, smiling at her. "I heard Hugh has been married several times."

"Yes, Hugh is so outstanding that no matter how many times he divorces, there's always someone willing to marry him. He's just too excellent. And each wife is prettier than the last!"

Zoey said, "Hugh is forty-four, and Evan is only thirty-one. Why such a big age gap?"

"I didn't want a second child, but my mother said one child would be too lonely. Whether it's a boy or a girl, they could take care of each other when we're gone."

"So, you had Evan thirteen years later?"

"Not exactly. I had several pregnancies that were girls, and I terminated them. After several times, the doctor said I might not be able to have more children, so I had it."

Robert added, "So you had Evan?"

"No, it was still a girl. I had to abandon her. But the doctor was wrong. I got pregnant again, and that was Evan. He wasn't easy to come by."

Taking three lives for Evan, which wasn't easy indeed.

Zoey found it laughable. "Your business is doing well, and you have a son. Why not keep a daughter? Can't you afford to raise them?"

Ava's shrewish demeanor came out. "Miss, you're wrong. Just because we have money doesn't mean we should spend it recklessly. Besides, girls are a burden here. They grow up to belong to someone else. It's not worth the investment."

"You already have a son. If you had a daughter, most people would be happy about it! You make it sound so reasonable to take lives!"

"It isn't that serious. It's just valuing boys over girls." Ava was indifferent. "Who doesn't want a son? Don't you? Sons can inherit the family business, but daughters can only bear children for other families."

###chapter 103

Zoey said helplessly, "Fine, whatever you guys want."

She let out a sarcastic laugh. "You've done your duty, had two sons. So have Hugh and Evan done their part and had kids for the family?"

Ava retorted, "What's the rush? Men can have kids even when they're seventy or eighty. But women hit menopause in this age."

"So, they haven't yet."

Ava was speechless.

Zoey deliberately provoked her. "Your son has had three wives and not a single child. Could it be that..."

Ava cut her off. "Hugh's just unlucky! Married three pretty but useless women. The more I think about it, the more it annoys me!"

Zoey felt like Ava was hiding something and asked, "Olivia can't have kids either?"

"Give her two more years. If she can't, Hugh'll divorce her!"

Robert sensed something was off. "Is it possible that the problem is with Hugh..."

Zoey interrupted Robert. "Because Hugh's unlucky, married several women, and still no kids, so you want Evan to hurry up and get married and have kids, right?"

"Whoever has kids, they're still part of our family. It doesn't matter who."

Zoey pressed her lips together. "May I ask, do you still keep in touch with Hugh's two ex-wives?"

Ava's face was full of irritation. "They're divorced, why would we keep in touch? They couldn't have kids, wasted Hugh's youth for years!"

"No marriage certificate? What about Olivia?" Robert asked, puzzled.

These people were not only superstitious but also ignorant of the law.

"What do you think?" Ava thought she was in the right. "If she had given us a son, we would have gotten the certificate, even if Hugh didn't want to. Look, she's been with us for four years! Not a single sign of pregnancy!"

Robert was speechless.

Zoey despised people who adhered to male chauvinism, and Ava was a prime example.

Thinking having a son was a big deal.

Thinking her son was the best, and no woman was good enough for him.

She sneered. "Do you know Hugh messes with prostitutes?"

"Prostitutes? Watch your words. Hugh just likes to go to bars and drink. How is that messing with prostitutes?" Ava not only knew but thought it was fine.

Zoey's eyes darkened with resentment, but Ava continued, "Men are like that. Olivia hasn't gotten pregnant. I hope some woman gets pregnant and gives me a grandson!"

Zoey didn't want to hear any more of her trivial life stories.

She coldly interrupted, "Just answer my question. What were you doing from 11 PM to 3 AM on the 20th?"

"11 PM to 3 AM?" Ava was indifferent. "Is that even a question? What do you think I was doing? I was sleeping, of course."

"Do you remember what time Hugh came home?"

"How could I remember? I take care of Evan all day, I'm exhausted. Hugh is so great, he comes home at different times every day. I can't stay up waiting for him!" Ava connected Zoey's earlier comment about Hugh messing with prostitutes. She seemed to guess what they were getting at and added, "Hugh often goes to bars. He's energetic, and women like him. I can't follow him all the time, can I?"

Robert suddenly thought that  Parents' values could really influence their children.

Ava, as a parent, didn't correct Hugh's behavior and even saw it as his charm.

No wonder Hugh acted so arrogant.

Growing up in such a family, it was hard to develop proper values.

Robert was both angry and frustrated, not at Ava as a mother, but at the backwardness of the village that caused all this.

Seeing Ava's smug and proud demeanor in front of him, Robert couldn't hold back and directly asked, "If Hugh is so charming and excellent, then explain to me why the police found Hugh's DNA in the bodies of three victims?"

"What?" Ava's mind went blank, cutting off all connection to the outside world.

After a moment of shock, she swallowed. "No way, what do you mean? Slandering Hugh? Hugh has money, he can get any woman he wants!"

"We're the cops, remember that. Before coming to Willowbrook Village, we had never met you or Hugh. We don't falsely accuse people. We rely on evidence!" Robert explained seriously. "The forensic team used advanced techniques and found Hugh's DNA in all three bodies!"

"Nonsense!" Ava's furious reaction was just like Hugh's.

She slammed the table, echoing Hugh's response. "Hugh has money! He's a big factory owner! How could he rape them? If this is true, those three sluts must have seduced Hugh!"

Robert looked at her coldly. "If you have evidence that they seduced Hugh, I'll apologize right now."

Ava was at a loss. The victims were dead, where could she find evidence?

But she didn't care. "Evidence? I can imagine it. They must have seduced Hugh, begging him to sleep with them!"

"Ms. Davis! Watch your language! Show some respect for the victims!" Robert said. "We cops work based on evidence. Since you have no evidence, and the victims are dead, we can only consider Hugh a prime suspect for their murder and rape."

"What are you talking about? Just because they seduced Hugh, he's a suspect? Why?" Ava's unreasonable attitude flared up again. "They must have seduced Hugh, and when he refused, they killed themselves out of anger!"

Robert and Zoey were stunned by her response.

Robert couldn't stand her voice anymore, but to maintain his police image, he tried to appear gentle. "Ms. Davis, should I repeat myself? Forensic tests show the victims were violated after death. There's no way they seduced Hugh!"

###chapter 104

"No way, there must be a mistake in the forensic report. Do it again!" Ava shouted.

Zoey couldn't believe the ignorance she was dealing with. She stressed, "Hugh, the one who's always surrounded by women and supposedly so 'amazing,' committed necrophilia."

Ava's face went pale, her eyes wide with panic as she tried to process what Zoey had just said.

After a few seconds, she shook her head frantically. "No, that's impossible. Hugh would never do something like that. Olivia was young, why would he choose a corpse over a living person? Besides, none of them are good enough for Hugh!"

Her previous certainty wavered, showing that even she had doubts about Hugh's character.

It was clear how bad Hugh's reputation was.

Even though Ava kept telling herself that Hugh was great, deep down, she must have felt ashamed of some of his actions.

Zoey watched Ava with satisfaction, giving a faint, ambiguous smile.

"You're sixty years old, right? You gave birth to two sons and became a hero in this family, but in reality, you're quite pitiful. Don't you think so? Your 'excellent' son is infertile, and to maintain Hugh's male pride, you kept blaming the women, changing wives one after another. I'm really curious, now that you see Evan as the one to carry on the family line, what will you do if Evan is also infertile?" Zoey said, not smiling, but her tone was filled with smugness.

"You, how dare you curse us! I'll fight you, you bitch!" Ava was so furious that she lost all semblance of decorum and lunged at Zoey.

Zoey didn't move, just sat next to Robert, watching her mockingly.

Before Ava could get close, cops outside the door restrained her easily. One of them warned, "Move again and you'll be charged with assaulting a cop! If you don't want to join Hugh in jail, behave yourself! This is a police investigation, not a place for your tantrums!"

Ava was so angry she was gasping for breath, almost unable to catch it.

If she didn't have to take care of Evan, she would have fought Zoey right there.

Thinking of Evan, she stopped, shook off the cop, and stormed out, slamming the door behind her.

No one stopped her; they had asked all they needed.

Robert leaned back in his chair, taking a moment to clear his mind. "I've been on the job for so long, I thought I was immune to people like this. But today, I realized I still can't control my temper after hearing these statements!"

"Officer Davis, it's normal. Every year brings new infuriating cases. We could only bear it." Zoey thought about Willowbrook Village and felt a strong urge to clean up the place.

Why should such harmful traditions continue to plague the next generation?

"Officer Davis, what do we do now?"

Robert took a deep breath and stood up. "Hugh keeps claiming he's innocent. Let's check out the bar. See if we find anything new. And Zoey, make sure the forensic team re-examines the semen samples thoroughly. We need to know the quantity, any other substances present, everything. The more detailed, the better."

"Got it!"

"Let's go. Notify the forensic team, then we'll head to the bar."

Zoey turned to leave but stopped, remembering something. "Officer Davis, there's one more person in Hugh's family we haven't questioned."

"Evan?" Robert immediately thought of him. "But his intelligence is impaired. His testimony isn't admissible in court."

"I know, Officer Davis, but he might be the key to solving this case. He's not stupid, just mentally at the level of a seven or eight-year-old. Hugh's family secrets might only be known to the members."

"I see your point." Robert considered for a moment and agreed with Zoey's suggestion.

They left the interrogation room together.

Not far away, Jordan was talking to Charles about the case.

Charles said, "Chad has done terrible things, but he's still the kids' father. No matter how I tried to persuade them, they refused to leave, insisting on waiting for Chad to come back. I told them it would be a long wait, but they said they'd wait as long as it takes... What can we do?"

Robert asked, "Do they have any other relatives?"

Charles stood up respectfully. "Officer Davis, I asked, but it seems they don't. I spoke to the oldest sister, and she said their grandparents are dead, and they don't know about other relatives. I had no choice but to ask Chad's neighbors. Guess what? Chad's wife was bought! She was only fifteen or sixteen when they got her, and she couldn't even speak properly. She's mentally impaired."

"Unbelievable. What do we do now?" Jordan was distressed by the situation.

Zoey suggested, "Why don't we send them to an orphanage? I can make some calls. The living conditions there would be much better than where they are now."

Charles agreed, "That's probably the best option. We really have no other choice."

As they discussed the children's future, they walked towards the car.

Jordan, recalling Dennis taking Chad away, asked curiously, "Didn't Chad already confess?"

"He only admitted to forcing Faye into a sex," Charles explained. "At first, he claimed it was consensual, but Officer Davis here tricked him into confessing everything. Chad may be bad, but he's simple-minded. He admitted to having sex with Faye multiple times."

Robert found it increasingly absurd. "Chad even said he wanted to marry Faye. But knowing she had a brother, he didn't want to support him. So he thought if he got her pregnant first, the Lynn family would rush to marry her off to save face. Rural folks care a lot about reputation. His plan was quite the fantasy, and it landed him in jail."

###chapter 105

"Damn it!" Jordan shouted, clearly pissed off.

He turned and followed Zoey into the back of the car. "Chad's such a dirtbag! I hope he rots in prison! Even if he doesn't die there, he'll be ancient by the time he gets out, he'll be ancient! His kids won't even know him; they'll have their own lives. Just thinking about him being alone and homeless makes me happy."

"Hearing you say that makes me feel better too," Zoey said, scooting over a bit and closing her eyes to rest.

"Those kids without a mother might be better off, at least their mother won't end up like the women in Willowbrook Village, sent off to serve others," Zoey added.

"Yeah, you're right..." Jordan sighed, thinking about the fate of the other girls in Willowbrook Village.

The girls in Willowbrook Village were truly pitiful.

She was so grateful she didn't live there.

The car arrived at the Starlit Lounge.

They left two people to check the surveillance footage.

Robert wanted Jordan and Zoey to investigate Willowbrook Village's 'intelligence network' to learn more about Hugh's two ex-wives.

Since there were no marriage certificates for these marriages, they couldn't investigate through official channels.

The surveillance in Willowbrook Village had only been installed gradually over the past few years, and there were still many blind spots, making it nearly impossible to track anything down.

So, this task fell to Jordan and Zoey.

When Zoey heard Robert assign this task to her, she immediately refused, "I can't do this kind of thing; I'm afraid I'll hit someone."

Robert, having transferred Zoey to his criminal investigation team, knew her well.

He had heard about Zoey's past incidents at the police station.

"Alright, then I'll go with Alexander to ask around. You and Jordan can go find Evan. If Evan's mother doesn't let you ask questions, handle it, but don't hurt anyone."

"Got it."

They had initially promised Ava not to take Evan's statement to lower their guard.

But now they had gathered all the necessary clues, so Evan was their breakthrough point.

Any evidence they could get from him would be a bonus.

Jordan had a stomachache, so it ended up being Zoey and Charles.

When they arrived at Evan's house, Charles was about to knock on the door, but Zoey quickly stopped him. "Wait, there's noise inside!"

Charles paused, pressing his ear against the door.

Unmistakably, they could hear Ava's voice scolding from inside.

There was also a faint, almost inaudible response, which had to be the unfortunate Olivia.

Zoey whispered, "Hugh's arrest has Ava and Olivia furious. I just made Ava mad earlier. If we go in directly, they'll fight us. An old woman and a frail woman, I can't fight back."

"So what do we do?" Charles asked, looking a bit lost.

"Go through the back!" Zoey scanned the area to make sure no one was watching and then led Charles around the house. "I know where Evan's room is."

They circled the yard and found a window at the back.

Zoey pointed. "This window leads to Evan's room."

"And then?"

"We go in!"

Charles nodded and pushed the window, surprised when it opened easily. He looked at Zoey in disbelief.

Zoey grinned and they exchanged a quick nod.

They climbed through the window slowly. As they got one leg over, they saw someone watching cartoons at a desk.

Charles pointed at the figure and whispered, "Evan?"

Zoey nodded and quickly climbed through.

In her haste, she accidentally pulled down the curtain, making a loud noise.

Charles froze, unsure whether to go in or out.

Evan noticed the two people at his window and stared at them curiously. The woman looked familiar, but the man was a stranger.

Charles was thinking of how to keep Evan from shouting.

Zoey, however, put on a fake smile. "We're humans being chased by aliens, seeking Spider-Man's help. Are you Spider-Man?"

Charles, still straddling the window, was confused.

At that moment, the animated series "Spider-Man" was playing on the phone.

Charles instantly understood Zoey's trick and chimed in, "Yes, Spider-Man, can you help us?"

When Evan heard two people suddenly calling him "Spider-Man" and asking for his help, his initially cautious expression transformed into one of sheer excitement, revealing his lack of intelligence.

He quickly put down his phone and imitated the signature move of Spider-Man from the show, declaring, "Of course! I am Spider-Man!"

Zoey quickly shushed him, worried he might alert Ava. "Can you help us fight the aliens?"

"Of course! I'm very strong. I'm Spider-Man, I'll protect you!"

"Let's go then." Zoey and Charles climbed back out the window.

They turned to help Evan.

They thought getting him to climb out would be a hassle.

But Evan moved smoothly, as if he did this often, not needing their help at all.

Evan landed safely, still in his slippers.

Zoey carefully closed the window from the outside.

Charles kept Evan entertained, trying to lead him to the church.

Zoey walked alongside, trying to extract useful information. "Spider-Man, do you know a place in the village where we can discuss battle plans without being found?"

"Of course! I know everything!" He waved his hand. "Follow me! I'll take you to a place aliens can't find!"

Charles let go of him, and he and Zoey followed.

Willowbrook Village was large, with interconnected paths, so they inevitably ran into some villagers.

Each villager they passed looked curiously at the trio, wondering why the police were with Evan.

Before long, Evan led them to the church.

Evan excitedly introduced the familiar yet strange 'church,' completely unaware of the complex expressions on Zoey and Charles' faces. "This place is safe from aliens. No one comes here usually."

###chapter 106

Charles glanced around to make sure no villagers were nearby. He quickly signaled Zoey to take Evan inside.

Evan had no idea why he was there, but he happily walked through the door. He seemed familiar with the place and headed straight for the main hall.

However, there were still police lines and evidence that needed to be preserved. Zoey and Charles were worried he might disturb something, so they held him back tightly.

"Why are you holding me? I am a Spider-Man." Evan asked, confused.

Zoey pointed to the outline of three bodies on the floor and asked, "Spider-Man, do you recognize this?"

Evan tilted his head and then shook it. "What is this? Did aliens leave it?"

Charles followed up, "Have you been here before?"

"Of course, this is my secret base."

Charles continued, "Who else knows about this place?"

Evan replied, "It's a secret, I can't tell."

Zoey asked, "Do you come here every day?"

Evan said, "I have to catch aliens!"

"Have you seen anyone here? Like three girls?"

Evan repeated, "I have to catch aliens!"

"Where were you the night before last? Did someone come here to discuss a battle plan with you?"

Evan insisted, "I have to catch aliens!"

Zoey was getting frustrated.

Charles looked at Zoey helplessly, wondering if they were really going to get anything out of him.

No matter what they asked, Evan's answer was always about catching aliens.

Seeing them silent, Evan raised his voice, "Didn't you say we were going to catch aliens? Where are the aliens? I want to catch aliens!"

When neither of them responded, Evan lost his patience.

Charles and Zoey kept asking him strange questions, which annoyed him.

Covering his ears, he shouted, "If we don't catch aliens, I'm going home!"

Evan tried to pull away from Charles.

They had worked hard to bring Evan here; there was no way they were letting him go so easily.

Charles held on tightly, but Evan was strong too.

The struggle was wearing Charles out.

Evan's constant shouting was getting on his nerves.

But during the struggle, Charles had an idea. "Spider-Man, how many aliens have you caught so far?"

Evan quieted down immediately, interested in the topic.

He started counting on his fingers, "One, two, three... three aliens."

Charles and Zoey tensed up at the information.

They asked carefully, "What kind of aliens?"

"Aliens can fly, they have flying saucers, but somehow the saucers stopped moving." Evan's description matched the initial crime scene, where three bodies were found hanging.

Charles, trying to contain his excitement, asked, "Was Janet one of them?"

"Janet?" Evan tilted his head, looking confused. "Who's Janet? Is that an alien's name?"

Zoey knew Evan's memory wasn't great, especially for people he didn't see often. She tried a different approach, "Did you see anyone familiar inside?"

Evan thought for a moment and then nodded, "Yes! But she was possessed by another alien. She's not my wife anymore; she became an alien."

Charles asked, "How did you catch the aliens?"

"I..." Evan started to speak but quickly covered his mouth. "No, it's a secret, I can't tell."

A person with low intelligence who couldn't remember the names of villagers knew to keep a secret. Someone must have told him not to reveal it.

Zoey asked, "Whose secret is it?"

Evan covered his mouth tightly, "I can't say..."

Zoey started thinking about possible suspects, while Charles tried to coax him, "We need a great Spider-Man to help us, but if you don't tell us anything, we'll find another Spider-Man!"

"No, I'm the only Spider-Man! Who else are you going to find?" Evan clung to Charles's hand, afraid he would be left behind.

"Trust me, I'm a really great Spider-Man..."

Charles acted skeptical, "I don't believe you."

Evan insisted, "Believe me!"

Charles repeated, "I don't believe you!"

"I'm really great, you won't find a better Spider-Man than me."

"I don't believe you!"

Zoey watched them argue strangely, lost in her own thoughts about suspects.

Suddenly, a frantic voice came from the door.

"Evan, where are you? Answer me if you hear me!"

"There are dead people inside, don't go in!"

"But Evan..."

"Fine, I won't go in. You can go if you want, but I think it's bad luck."

As the voices got closer, Zoey and Charles exchanged a look, knowing their time was up. They had to bring Evan out of the church's main hall.

Ava looked genuinely worried, tears in her eyes. Olivia stood beside her, holding her arm, looking fragile. Both of them lit up when they saw Evan. But their expressions changed when they saw the two cops with him.

"You took Hugh, and now you want to take Evan too? You're trying to destroy my family, aren't you?" Ava was furious. "What did we do to deserve this?"

Charles tried to explain, but Zoey cut him off, "Insulting the cops is also a crime! First, understand the situation before causing a scene. Your son wandered off, and if we didn't know Evan's condition, do you think we'd care? This place is full of evidence, and we were worried he'd destroy it!"

Charles quickly backed her up, "Exactly!"

###chapter 107

"Don't lie to me!" Ava shouted. "I heard someone say you dragged Evan here!"

Zoey glanced towards the church entrance. "Who told you that?"

Ava turned and called out, "Gemma, get in here."

Gemma heard her name but hesitated. Instead of entering, she shouted from outside, "There are dead bodies in there. I'm not going in. I don't want to attract any bad luck."

Charles thought to himself, 'This superstitious nonsense is ridiculous. If everyone thought like her, we'd have no detectives or coroners. According to her logic, everyone would be covered in bad luck.'

Ava, determined to prove her point, huffed, "Fine, let's go outside then!"

She pushed Olivia, who was supporting her, aside and dragged a bewildered Evan towards the door. Zoey and Charles had no choice but to follow.

As soon as they stepped outside, Ava confronted Gemma. "Gemma, tell them! Didn't you say they forced Evan to come here?"

Gemma avoided eye contact with the cops and tried to shake off Ava's grip, but Ava's strength, honed from years of farm work, was too much. Reluctantly, Gemma sided with the village chief's family. "Yes, I saw them. They were all together, bringing Evan here."

Zoey wasn't about to let Ava twist the story. "Gemma, be clear. Wasn't Evan walking ahead while we followed?"

Gemma thought back and couldn't find a flaw in Zoey's words. "It seemed like that..."

Ava, feeling betrayed, snapped, "Gemma, that's not what you told me! You said they were dragging Evan, and he was struggling!"

Gemma hesitated. "Well, yes, but..."

Zoey cut in, "Gemma, just a friendly reminder: falsely accusing cops can lead to charges of obstructing justice. You could go to jail, and it could affect your family's future."

Gemma had only wanted to help her neighbor, who was the village chief's wife. After hearing she would go to jail, Gemma quickly distanced herself from Ava. "No, Ava, you must have misunderstood. I just said they were walking together. After that, I went back to my chores. I never mentioned anything about kidnappers. What are you talking about?"

Ava was stunned. "What?"

Furious, she turned to Olivia. "You say something!"

Olivia, looking down and appearing frail, murmured, "Mom, I don't know. I wasn't paying attention when you were talking."

Ava's anger boiled over. "You all! You're too scared to speak up in front of the cops! It's not your child who's missing, so you side with them to bully me, right?"

Zoey, not wanting to waste more time, said, "Ava, Evan is right here in front of you. If you're so worried, why not tie a rope around him and hold onto it even while you sleep? That way, he'll always be safe."

With that, she turned and walked back into the church, ignoring Ava's angry shouts.

Charles had considered backing Zoey up, but seeing her walk away, he decided against it. If she didn't feel the need to respond, neither would he.

Zoey was curious. "How did they know Evan was here? Even if they saw us on the way, they wouldn't have known to come here."

Charles replied, "Didn't Gemma say she saw us bringing Evan here?"

"No," Zoey shook her head. "She said she didn't know where we were coming from or going to. I paid attention to everyone we passed on the way here. Gemma couldn't have known we were heading to the church. She wouldn't have followed us, especially since she's so superstitious about places with dead bodies."

Charles added. "Maybe Ava's family had been here before for questioning, so she assumed we brought Evan here too?"

Zoey, recalling her argument with Ava, doubted it. "Ava accused us of kidnapping. If we were kidnappers, why would we bring Evan to the church in Willowbrook Village? Wouldn't it make more sense to leave the village?"

"Zoey, you're really sharp. That makes sense," Charles said, impressed. "But they got here so quickly. We hadn't even started questioning Evan when they arrived. If Evan saw the crime scene and possibly the killer, and maybe even the crime itself..."

Zoey nodded. "Exactly."

"If our theory is correct, the most likely suspect is Hugh," Charles speculated. "If Hugh committed the murder, Evan might help cover it up. No one else would. And with Evan's limited understanding, he wouldn't help unless it was family. But..." Charles was puzzled. "Hugh doesn't seem to care about Evan. If he did, he'd know who Evan was marrying, right?"

"Right, and he wouldn't use the alien story to trick Evan," Zoey added.

Charles was even more confused. "So, the killer must be someone who knows Evan very well. Not just anyone in the village, but someone who knows his obsession with aliens and Spider-Man. That person is the killer?"

Zoey bent down and examined the marked area around the body.

###chapter 108

Zoey's mind flashed to the image of a corpse. "Evan said he saw an alien that could fly... so the body he saw was hanging? The body we found was clearly moved and laid on the ground."

Thinking about this, she fell into another puzzling mystery. "What I really want to know is, did the necrophilia happen before or after the body was hung up?"

Charles also found the killer's logic too chaotic. "Now that you mention it, it seems a bit strange. The only thing we can confirm is that all three victims died from mechanical asphyxiation by hanging. But the first person who found the scene saw the body lying on the ground. Could the killer have hanged the victims and then taken them down to commit necrophilia?"

But after saying that, he felt something was off. "Zoey, why hang them up at all? It's too much trouble. Why not just strangle them and leave them on the ground? If the killer is committing necrophilia, he's definitely a man. Almost every man in Willowbrook Village is a farmer and has some strength."

Zoey suddenly remembered what Evan had said earlier. "Do you remember Evan said he defeated the alien? I'm curious about how he did that."

After saying this, she lowered her head and carefully examined the three marks on the body, observing meticulously from top to bottom.

"Evan also said the alien he saw could fly. If he makes a flying alien unable to fly... does that count as defeating it?"

"You mean..." Charles quickly caught on. "It's very likely the killer guided Evan to take the body down?"

"I can't give you a definite answer because it's just a guess." Zoey shrugged and continued her examination.

Charles still couldn't understand the killer's logic and asked, "I still don't get it. Why would the killer hang the body up and then have someone else take it down?"

Killing someone was not something they wanted a second person to know about, especially an idiot. Weren't they afraid of getting caught?

Zoey looked up at the beam where the rope used to hang the body was never found.

She speculated, "Maybe the killer was caught by Evan while dealing with the body. He didn't plan to take the body down, but to delay the discovery, he tricked Evan into thinking it was an alien and had him take the body down to avoid Evan screaming and drawing attention."

"There's another possibility... the person who took the body down isn't the same as the one who hung it up. The first person could hang the body, but the second didn't, so they had to get Evan's help."

Charles looked at Zoey, his mind piecing together the crime scene.

Two figures, their faces unclear, constantly talking and moving the body. Just as he was about to uncover the truth, he found he couldn't see their faces.

The truth was right in front of him, so close.

The church's main hall, long abandoned and unswept, was thick with dust.

Zoey couldn't stand it after a while and walked to the door to breathe some fresh air.

Looking up at the blue sky, Zoey felt a sense of clarity. "I believe we're really close to the truth."

Seeing Zoey's confident look, Charles relaxed a bit. "Yeah, I feel the same way."

Zoey turned back and gave him a forced smile. "What's wrong? You losing confidence?"

Charles sighed. "Honestly, I still haven't found a clear lead. Not much to go on."

Zoey chuckled. "Come on, the villagers here have the intelligence of elementary school kids. You think you're dumber than them?"

Charles was speechless.

Before they knew it, it was mealtime, and they headed down the hill to grab a bite.

They met up with Alexander and Dennis to see if there were any updates from the bar's surveillance.

Alexander couldn't wait to share. "I might have some bad news. The bar's surveillance shows Hugh entered the Starlit Lounge on the night of the 20th and didn't leave until after midnight. Based on the distance, he wouldn't have returned to Willowbrook Village until after 1 AM."

Dennis added, "We also found the woman who served Hugh that night, but she's not working today. We're trying to contact her."

"Trying to contact her?" Zoey asked.

"Yeah, we haven't been able to reach her. Maybe she's catching up on sleep at home."

Robert looked at his team, all dedicated to the case, and felt a bit of pride.

He opened a soda and poured everyone a glass. "I didn't find out much. They only know Hugh had two ex-wives, but they didn't interact much. Apparently, he met them at his factory. No one knows why they divorced. He always kept a low profile. The villagers only found out about the second and third wives after he brought them home."

Dennis asked, "What are their names?"

"One is named Haven. They don't remember the other one; it's been too long. But..." Robert continued, "The villagers said Haven is somehow related to the informant, Rilla. When I asked Rilla, she said she didn't know."

Jordan joined the speculation. "But I find it strange. They had each other's contact info, but one day she just couldn't reach her. She asked Hugh's family and found out they divorced."

Charles said, "So, after the divorce, she just cut off contact with her friends? What's that about?"

Zoey interjected, "Shouldn't we be more concerned about where Hugh's two ex-wives went?"

"Yeah, how can two living people just disappear after a divorce? How can there be no trace of them?" Charles added.

Zoey swallowed a big piece of meat and said calmly, "Just from Hugh's mother, you can see their stinginess. These rural folks are narrow-minded. Neither of the ex-wives had a marriage certificate. Do you know what that means?"

"What does it mean?" Charles asked.

"Abandonment. In all our interviews, the villagers of Willowbrook Village all share the same idea: marry off their daughters to a well-off family. But they overlook the most important question: will the well-off family share their wealth? Similarly, Ava is so stingy, that there's no way she'd give them money. Think about it, a woman who does housework all day with no income, how would she survive after a divorce?" Zoey explained.

###chapter 109

Alexander said, "If they were broke, we would've heard from them in the last few years 'cause they couldn't leave the county. But it's been over a decade, no one's seen them. The weirdest part is Haven and Rilla, who were so tight. Rilla even went to Hugh's place to check on her. So why did Haven just ghost her?"

Jordan blinked. "Yeah, it's strange. There was no hint Hugh wanted a divorce. The villagers said Haven had griped about Ava before, but they had no clue about the divorce. It just happened out of nowhere, even Rilla didn't know... isn't that odd?"

"What's so odd about it? There's only one explanation: Haven herself didn't know she was getting divorced. How could she tell anyone?" Dennis said, sounding more and more skeptical. "If you keep talking like this, there might be a few more unsolved cases in Willowbrook Village. This is serious enough to report as missing persons. Hugh's family is really suspicious."

"Let's eat first, we can think about it after dinner." The waiter brought the last dish, and Robert waved them off, signaling a temporary end to the conversation.

"Rilla's phone still has Haven's number. Although it hasn't connected in a long time, I've sent it to the tech department to see if they can trace it," Jordan said, then lowered his head to eat his pasta.

The room fell into a rare silence, broken only by the sounds of eating.

After dinner, everyone found a comfortable spot in the room to rest and discuss the case further.

Unexpectedly, a new test report came in: Sample B had very little semen, but it contained trace amounts of dimethicone.

Initially, they only tested a small sample for DNA, which was why they missed the dimethicone. This time, after extracting as much semen as possible, they found it.

"What's dimethicone?" Charles asked, curious.

Dennis said, "Never heard of it."

Jordan checked his phone, "It says here it's an anti-foaming agent used for gastrointestinal bloating and acute pulmonary edema. Does that mean the killer has this condition?"

Zoey, who had been quiet, opened her eyes and said coldly, "Dimethicone is used in condom lubricants."

Everyone connected dimethicone with condoms and fell silent.

Then, they all looked at Zoey.

Zoey, puzzled, asked, "Why are you all looking at me?"

"How do you know?"

Zoey frowned, realizing her teammates lacked professional knowledge, and retorted, "Why don't you know?"

The questioner was speechless.

Robert, trying to ease the awkwardness, stepped in, "The case is getting more interesting. The bar provided an alibi for Hugh, and now we've found condom material in the body. Using a condom would prevent semen detection, unless..."

"The condom was punctured?" Dennis suggested.

Jordan looked at the group. "But Ava was desperate for a child. Why would she have condoms at home? Maybe they didn't even have any."

Dennis thought Jordan was naive, "Did you forget Hugh liked to mess with prostitutes? He would definitely carry condoms."

Zoey supported Dennis. "I agree with Dennis. Hugh would carry condoms, but the lubricant is on the outside, contacting the vagina. It's unlikely we'd find just a trace. Hugh might have used the condom inside out, not realizing it was punctured, and the semen carried out the lubricant."

The others were speechless, wondering why Zoey a little girl was so knowledgeable.

Robert, a seasoned detective, had encountered such issues countless times, but discussing it with two young women felt uncomfortable. "I think Zoey's right. Hugh was confident during his statement because he thought no one would find out about his condom."

Charles asked, "So who punctured the condom?"

As soon as he asked, Jordan and Zoey answered in unison, "Ava."

"It must have been her," Robert agreed. "She said if Hugh had a child with a prostitute, she'd make him divorce Olivia."

"Haha, the more I hear, the more satisfying it is. Ava got Hugh sent to jail? Serves him right."

"If Ava tampered with all of Hugh's condoms, that would be interesting," Dennis added, laughing. "Hugh frequenting those places, thinking he was safe from STDs, only to be sabotaged by Ava."

Charles looked at Dennis. "You're right, but if Hugh had an STD... what about Olivia?"

Everyone fell silent again.

Olivia, who had done nothing wrong, married Hugh at a naive age and had to endure all this, it was truly pitiful.

"Forget about Olivia. Everyone has their fate," Zoey said, showing no sympathy for Olivia or any woman in Willowbrook Village.

They were too stubborn to be saved.

"We need to focus on solving the case. We're stuck now, and I think our breakthrough might be with Evan or the Lynn daughters' notebooks, but we've learned almost nothing from them."

Charles, thinking of Evan, felt helpless. "Hoping to get a lead from Evan? He only talks about fighting aliens. Cases with child witnesses are the hardest."

Alexander, who had been quiet, suddenly had an idea. "There's someone else we can ask."

"Who?" Zoey asked.

"The Lynn's son."

"Right!" Jordan remembered. "He's twelve, not a little kid. He should understand things."

"Let's head to Faye's house!"

"Let's go!"

Another hour-long drive.

Finn Lynn was crouched by the chicken coop, watching the chickens eat. The detectives approached, their eyes following his gaze.

###chapter 110

It took Finn a few seconds to realize that strangers had suddenly entered his home.

He turned his head, but since he was crouching, he had to look up.

Three adults were staring at him, their expressions somewhat stern.

Finn felt a bit intimidated by their imposing presence. After all, he was just a kid. He swallowed hard, stumbled to his feet, and tried to find his mom.

But after taking a couple of steps, he remembered that his mom wasn't home. She had told him where she was going just a moment ago.

Alexander noticed Finn's fear and gave him a reassuring smile. "Hey, you're Finn, right? Is your mom around?"

"No, she's not..."

"Any idea when she'll be back?"

"I don't know..."

Alexander kept his smile gentle, trying not to scare him. "Don't worry, kiddo. We're not here to hurt you. We were here last time too. Remember us?"

With Alexander's comforting words, Finn slowly nodded. "Yeah, you guys are like cops. Our teacher told us that cops are good people. They catch bad guys and never bully good people. We respect them a lot."

Alexander chuckled at Finn's innocence. "That's right, you're a smart kid."

"So, since your teacher told you we're good people, can I ask you some questions?"

Finn realized his teacher was right. Seeing Alexander's smile, he felt less scared. "Sure, if I know the answers, I'll tell you."

"Do you have two sisters?"

Finn nodded, but his tone and expression showed no sadness. "Yeah, I have two sisters."

Alexander observed his demeanor, guessing that the family had hidden the truth about the sisters' deaths from him.

He asked again, "Are your sisters home?"

"No." Finn shook his head. "My mom said they went far away to work. They're going to make money to buy me a house and find me a wife. They'll make lots of money."

Seeing the conversation was on track, Jordan joined in. "How do your sisters treat you?"

"They're really nice to me. They take me out to play and tell me stories."

"What do your sisters like to do?"

Finn thought for a moment. "They like to write in their diaries, save money, cook, and go out to listen to stories..."

Zoey noticed something and interrupted. "Where do they go to listen to stories?"

Since the group entered the house, Finn was most afraid of Zoey, maybe because her voice was a bit loud.

Fear quickly spread across Finn's face. "I-I don't know. My sisters don't take me..."

Zoey pressed on. "Why don't they take you? Do they not like you?"

"No, my sisters like me..." But after answering, Finn suddenly realized that his sisters hadn't talked to him or called home in a long time. He started to feel as though. "Maybe my sisters don't like me anymore."

"Don't cry, it's not like that. You're their only brother. They like you the most." Alexander comforted him. "Think carefully. What reason did your sisters give for not taking you?"

Finn nodded. "Right, my sisters said only girls could go listen to stories. So I wanted to be a girl too..."

Jordan understood. "The sisters probably just wanted to go out by themselves and didn't want to take Finn. Girls have their own secrets to share."

Alexander didn't respond to Jordan. He continued, "Do you know if your sisters wrote in their diaries every day?"

"Yeah, they wrote in their diaries every day. Both of them did. I wanted to read them, but they wouldn't let me. They said it was their privacy."

"Do you know what their diaries look like?"

Finn nodded eagerly. "I know! I have a lot of them. Come with me!"

The group followed Finn into the house, straight to his and his mom's room.

There was only one bed and a desk. Most of the books on the desk were first to fourth-grade textbooks and some comic books.

Finn crouched in front of the desk and skillfully pulled out the last notebook from a stack of identical ones.

He handed it to them. "This is the notebook I've been saving since first grade. My sisters' notebooks are all here too. They told me notebooks are important. I can draw and write in them..."

Alexander opened one at random. It was a new, blank notebook with no writing in it. "Did your sisters use this?"

Finn thought for a moment, then opened the desk drawer and took out a pink notebook with a Snow White sticker on it.

With only the group in the house, he made a 'shh' gesture. "Sir, I hope you won't tell my sisters about this. I want to surprise them. I saved up my own money to buy this. Many girls at school use this notebook, but it's too expensive. My sisters wouldn't buy it for themselves, so I saved my mom's spare change to buy it for them. I haven't had lunch for a week. Please don't tell them."

Looking at the pure and kind-hearted Finn, the group's mood grew heavier.

A child's world was always simple. His mom didn't want to tell him the truth, probably for this reason.

If he knew his two sisters were dead, how devastated would he be?

It was better to let time gradually fade this secret until he could handle it.

"Okay, we'll keep your secret. Remember, we're cops." Alexander ruffled his hair, feeling a pang of sadness.

The more he looked at Finn, the more he liked him.

"By the way, do you know where your sisters' diaries are?"

"Yeah, they're on my sisters' desk."

"Can you help us find them?"

"Sure." Finn, being a helpful child, agreed immediately and walked to his sisters' room.

He opened the drawer but didn't see the diaries.

Finn searched the drawer thoroughly, puzzled. "They were here. Where did they go..."

The group watched Finn's every move, knowing he didn't seem to be pretending.

It seemed the diaries had indeed been taken.

That meant their previous theory was correct. The diaries must contain some secrets.

"If the diaries had something harmful, they might have been destroyed by now."

"By whom? The killer?"

"The killer might not know about the diaries. I think it could be the sisters themselves."

Alexander disagreed with Zoey's guess. "I don't think so. I also like to write in a diary. Diaries hold too many memories that the brain can't always recall. Writing in a diary becomes a habit. Not writing for a day feels uncomfortable. Many people even want their diaries buried with them when they die."

###chapter 111

Zoey said, "Wait, so it was hidden? But if it was hidden, someone would find it eventually, right? Doesn't that defeat the purpose? If they didn't want it found, why not just destroy it? And if they wanted it found someday, why hide it in the first place?"

Even though her words were a bit jumbled, Alexander got the gist.

To him, Zoey seemed almost detached at that moment. "Some truths are better discovered later."

"For who? The killer? Every day we wait, he gets another day of freedom!"

Alexander replied calmly, "For the victims."

"The victims are dead. How does it help them? Are you saying it's our fault for investigating the killer?"

"No, that's not what I meant," Alexander explained. "These are just personal thoughts, not related to solving the case. I'm trying to understand the victims' perspective."

"I get it. You mean the victims wouldn't want the truth of their murder to come out so quickly, right?"

"Don't twist my words. That's not what I meant."

The others around them stayed silent, unsure why the argument had suddenly flared up.

Jordan noticed the detectives' silence and tried to break the tension. "Well, actually..."

Before she could finish, Finn suddenly started crying.

Everyone turned to look at him, confused about why he was crying.

Finn's sobs grew louder.

"Shut up, or I'll tape your mouth shut!" Zoey snapped.

Finn was scared for a second but kept crying.

Zoey, clearly redirecting her earlier anger towards Finn, shouted at him. Alexander quickly stepped in to comfort him, "Why are you crying all of a sudden? Don't be scared, I'm here. You can tell us anything. Remember what the teacher said? You have to trust us."

The more he comforted, the harder Finn cried.

Zoey, now irritated, yelled again, "Shut up!"

Finn, terrified of her, immediately quieted down, proving her method more effective than Alexander's.

Alexander felt his earlier efforts were pointless.

Finn, still upset, clung to Alexander's hand. "I can't find my sister's diaries. I didn't take good care of them. How will I face my sisters now?"

"Think carefully. Besides here, where else could it be? We'll help you look for it, okay?" Alexander comforted.

"Thank you, Sir."

"Tell me, where did your sisters usually like to go?"

"To listen to stories."

"Where did she go to listen?"

"I don't know."

"How often did she go?"

"Sometimes not for a long time, sometimes every day."

Alexander added, "Anywhere else?"

"To work."

"Where did she work?"

"At home."

They asked a lot of questions but made no progress.

With the autopsy report, it seemed like the case was moving forward... but also not.

Jordan sighed in the yard, "What does it mean, going to listen to stories? Is there someone in the village who tells stories?"

Zoey was adamant. "There's no way there are cultural activities here. If there were, this place wouldn't be so backward."

Alexander frowned, deep in thought. "We've been all over Willowbrook Village, asked around. There are only a few dozen households. Besides the Lynns' daughters being close to Janet, there doesn't seem to be anyone else..."

They were back to square one.

The three victims were best friends, but with their deaths, there were no other clues.

The only diary had vanished without a trace.

Jordan noticed everyone looking a bit down and suggested, "Should we go ask again?"

Alexander saw it was still early and agreed. "Alright."

As they left Faye's house, a gentle breeze brushed Zoey's cheek, rustling the nearby leaves.

"Alexander, you said some truths are better discovered in the future?" Zoey asked.

Alexander thought Zoey was bored and wanted to argue again.

He was tired, didn't want to argue, just wanted to solve the case quickly.

He looked at Zoey warily, unsure of her intentions, and asked, "Did I say that?"

"You're right!"

Alexander stunned. "What?"

Zoey continued, "If the Lynns' daughters thought like you, wanting the diary's secrets to remain hidden but also hoping the truth would come out someday, then they wouldn't hide the diary in a very obscure place. It would be somewhere that would be discovered over time."

"What does that mean?" Jordan asked curiously.

Zoey glanced around, then fixed her gaze in one direction, as if she had an idea.

She suddenly turned and ran back into the house.

Alexander and Jordan, stunned, followed her.

"Over time..." Zoey reopened the door to Faye's house, immediately spotting a butter jar in the kitchen. She muttered to herself, "Like, the bottom of a butter jar."

"Or eating a box of candy, down to the last piece."

She then pushed open the door to Finn and his mother's room. "For example, using a stack of notebooks to the last one."

Finn, lying on the bed, was startled by Zoey's sudden entrance. "Why are you back? Is there something else?"

Zoey quickly asked, "Where's your notebook?"

"Under the desk..."

"Get it for me."

"Okay..." Finn struggled to pull out his notebook from under the desk.

Before he could finish, Zoey took it from him.

She then knocked over the neatly stacked notebooks.

Finn was too intimidated by her to say anything.

Zoey knelt down to search, noticing the two behind her weren't moving. She looked back at them. "What are you standing there for? Help me!"

Were they searching for evidence? Or was this a robbery?

The two were stunned for a moment, then snapped out of it: "Okay." They hurried to help.

Finn, scared by Zoey, started crying again.

Zoey quickly stuffed a candy into his mouth before he could cry out.

Finn, caught off guard, just held the candy in his mouth.

"Is it good?" Zoey asked.

###chapter 112

Finn nodded, but his eyes still showed a bit of reluctance and frustration.

"This candy costs three bucks each," Zoey said.

Finn didn't say anything, but he was clearly shocked by the price.

He had never had such expensive candy before.

The three of them quickly started flipping through the notebooks.

Zoey didn't have to search long before she found a slightly worn-out notebook. She opened it with a keen eye and saw it was filled with dense writing, a smile forming on her lips.

"Got it!" Though she was usually calm, there was a hint of excitement in her voice.

Alexander and Jordan hadn't expected the Lynns' daughters to hide the diary here.

They looked at Zoey with a touch of admiration. "You're amazing," Jordan praised, then returned to the matter at hand. "These girls are really good at hiding things. It's so inconspicuous, but if you keep using it, it will eventually come in handy..."

Zoey traded another piece of candy for the notebook, and Finn happily agreed.

It was a good deal no matter how you looked at it.

His mom and Finn would buy him new notebooks whenever he needed them, but delicious candy like this might not come around often.

"Do you want a few more notebooks?" Finn's eyes sparkled, clearly won over by the candy.

Zoey tossed him another handful and left their house.

Alexander held the notebook, worried. "Should we tell them? This is the most important evidence in the case."

"He's just a kid. What does he know? If you tell him, he'll just give it back to his sister."

Alexander replied, "True."

Jordan firmly supported Zoey. "Yeah, he doesn't need it anyway. We can return it after we're done. Besides, Zoey bought it fair and square with candy."

Zoey was speechless.

If only a few more pieces of candy could buy all the evidence, that would be great.

Alexander just wanted to ensure the victim's family was informed, but given their reasoning, it seemed fine.

They quickly got into the car.

Then they put on disposable gloves and started flipping through the diary.

The handwriting was not great but still legible, clearly written by someone who hadn't had much schooling.

Each page had only a little content, sometimes covering two or three days, which explained why such a thin notebook lasted so long.

The earlier entries were very mundane, talking about the weather and daily chores.

From the diary entries, it was clear that Faye was the one writing, frequently mentioning Sadie.

[Today it snowed here. Willowbrook Village looks especially beautiful when it snows, with everything covered in white. Mom made us shovel snow early in the morning. Sadie and I shared a look and buried Finn in the snow. He couldn't fight us off, so we pinned him down. We had so much fun. Finn wanted to tell Mom, but we threatened him that we wouldn't play with him anymore if he did. Finn is very sensible and immediately stopped complaining. It was so funny, the more I think about it, the funnier it gets.]

[Finn loves eating fish. Sadie and I planned to catch one for him from the river, but we had no experience and spent the whole morning without catching anything, just getting our new clothes dirty. It was so frustrating, but Finn is amazing. He caught a fish right away. I'm curious how he did it, but he won't tell me. He just wants me to learn.]

[We are such a happy family. I hope we stay this happy forever. It's been so long since we've seen Dad. Mom says it will be a while before we see him again. Dad has to work hard to support us. The last time I saw him, he looked so much older, his hair half gray. I wish I could help out sooner, and start working to share the burden. Sadie heard and wanted to join me. She's too young, she can't go. I told her to wait until she's older. But I really miss Dad. I wonder how he's doing out there alone. I can't show it in front of Sadie, though. If she cries, I won't be able to hold back my tears, and then Mom will cry too.]

The earlier entries were all very routine, either missing their dad or writing about household chores.

They read everything to avoid missing any important clues.

They had flipped through several pages, and Jordan was starting to get sleepy, yawning multiple times.

Finally, they reached September 21st.

The diary entry read: [I don't know if Sadie feels the same, but I always feel like someone is secretly watching me. Today, while helping Mom in the field, she went home early to cook, leaving me to finish up. Mr. Lopez suddenly appeared out of nowhere, insisting on being friends. We're all from the same village, and he's my elder, so I always greet him. Why does he want to be friends? It's so weird.]

[I remember Mom telling me that Mr. Lopez's wife was bought, and she died after giving birth. He's been raising his kids alone all these years. His daughter has talked to me a few times, looking so thin and pitiful, so I agreed to be friends with Mr. Lopez.]

[These days, whenever I go to the field, Mr. Lopez finds a chance to talk to us. Sadie seems a bit scared of him. To make her feel better, I talk to him instead, but he always asks strange questions. I don't really want to talk to him anymore, but Mom says I'm being rude, so I have to answer him.]

[Mr. Lopez asked why I always stick with Sadie. I think it's a silly question. Sadie is my sister, of course, I take her everywhere. I can't just leave her at home. She's my sister.]

From this day on, every entry mentioned Chad.

Then suddenly, there were no entries for five days.

When the diary resumed, it seemed like Sadie was writing, as the handwriting was different from Faye's.

Faye's writing was neat and confident.

Sadie's looked like a beginner's, clumsy and heavy-handed, leaving deep marks on the paper.

[Recently, Faye hasn't been talking to me much. I don't know what's wrong. She won't tell me, and she doesn't smile as much. What's going on, Faye? Can you tell me? Please don't ignore me.]

###chapter 113

[I finally remembered when Faye stopped smiling. It was one night when she went to the restroom and came back saying she needed to get a pad for Mr. Lopez's daughter. It was just a simple errand, but she didn't come back for a long time... I waited so long that I fell asleep. When I woke up, I saw Faye crying. She handed me her diary and said she didn't want to write in it anymore because there was nothing happy to record.]

[But why did Faye stop writing in her diary? I'm really curious. Even when I write in my diary, Faye doesn't look at it. What happened? I kept asking her, but she never answered me. She just told me to write whatever I wanted and that the diary was mine now. I agreed and thought about writing everything down, even asking Faye if there was anything she wanted me to record for her. She always said there wasn't.]

[Today, I'm really happy because Faye finally opened up to me. She told me that someone liked her and wanted to marry her. I kept asking who it was, but Faye wouldn't say. I asked if she wanted to marry him, and she said no, she was scared. I was happy because Faye finally let me know what was on her mind. I thought if I could find that man, I could stop him from making Faye unhappy. Faye didn't want to say it, but I wanted to protect her and speak up for her.]

[Recently, Faye has been acting strange. I can always tell when she leaves after I fall asleep. She must think I don't know, but I wake up when she leaves, sometimes because of the sound of the toilet flushing when she comes back. Last night, she tried to leave again, and I held onto her, not wanting her to go. I felt like she wasn't doing something good when she went out, but I couldn't explain why.]

[Faye cried, holding onto me and crying nonstop. I didn't know why she was crying, but seeing her cry made me want to cry too. We must have been too loud because Mom came in and asked why we were crying in the middle of the night. Faye, still crying, said someone wanted to marry her. Mom laughed and said it was a good thing, that Faye would have to get married someday. Faye cried even harder after hearing that. I spoke up for Faye, saying it made her unhappy, but Mom said I would understand when I was older. I didn't want to understand; I just wanted Faye to be happy and stay with me. Mom tried to comfort Faye for a long time.]

[It was so long that Finn woke up, rubbing his eyes and asking why we were crying while Mom was the only one laughing. I said I didn't know. Mom kept talking to Faye, asking who wanted to marry her, but Faye wouldn't say. Mom thought Faye was just shy and said it was okay, that she was her mom and would help her figure it out. Faye, pushed to the edge, cried out, 'Does it mean I have to marry Chad?' I didn't know who Chad was, but Mom said it didn't matter who she married, that if no one else wanted to marry Faye, she would have to marry Chad when the time came. Faye cried even harder and asked why she had to get married. Mom said women were born to get married and have children.]

[I don't get why women have to get married. I remember in school, the teacher never mentioned this. Is it something you learn later? If so, I won't have the chance to learn it. Mom said girls don't need to learn much. Actually, I kind of miss school.]

[Faye cried all night, and in the morning, her eyes were all puffy. I felt so bad for her. I wanted to comfort her but didn't know what to say. She said she was feeling down and asked me to stay with her. I said I would. She said she wanted to take me to hear a story. I didn't know what story, or where in the village we could hear one. I kept asking Faye, and she said I would find out soon. What kind of story would it be? I'm so excited.]

(The next page was torn out.)

[Rilla's story was so interesting. I wanted to keep asking her to tell me more, but I was afraid she would get annoyed with me, so I didn't show how much I liked it. Faye pulled me away, but I want to go back tomorrow to hear more.]

The diary turned another page.

[It's so strange. Last night, I went to the restroom, and Faye kept calling me, crying, and waking up Mom and Finn. When I came back, Faye didn't say anything, just kept asking where I went. I said I went to the restroom, but Faye said I should call her next time. I don't understand. I can go to the restroom by myself. Why does Faye need to come with me?]

[Today, Faye took me to Rilla's house again. Her stories are even better than the ones on TV. It feels so good. I kind of want to go to the places she talks about, but do they really exist?]

[I think they must, because Rilla is a college student. What she says must be true.]

[At night, Faye went out again. I wanted to go with her, but she refused, saying it was the last time. Tomorrow, she would take me out to play. I said my diary was almost full, and Faye said she would buy me a prettier one in a few days. I'm so excited.]

This was the last page of the diary.

Jordan clenched his teeth in anger. "That Chad is a scumbag! How could he bully two kids like that? It's clear they were being threatened. Look at this part, it's obvious. Sadie went to the restroom, and Faye was frantic. Chad must have been trying to hurt Sadie."

"She tried to get help from her mom, but her mom's response broke her heart. It was so different from what she expected," Alexander said, his expression dark. "With her mom's attitude, if Chad threatened to have sex with her, she would probably marry her off to him without a second thought."

"But she's just an eighteen-year-old kid!" Jordan's fists tightened. "To suffer such pain before dying, it makes me so angry. I just want to scream!"

Unlike their emotional reactions, Zoey was much colder, almost devoid of empathy. "Chad's already been arrested, hasn't he?"

###chapter 114

Zoey's mind was racing with thoughts of solving the case. She flipped through the diary over and over until she landed on one particular page.

"Hey, check this out," she said, showing the others. "See the last entry? It must've been written right before Sadie died. She asked Faye to take her out, probably to meet the killer, but Sadie didn't know that. And look here," She flipped to an earlier page, "they were supposed to listen to Rilla's story, but then a page is missing, and the date skips a day. What's on that missing page? It's important. They kept mentioning going to hear stories. What kind of stories? And why hadn't Faye heard any stories before she was attacked? The diary doesn't mention it."

Alexander and Jordan, who had been lost in their grief, snapped out of it.

Alexander frowned slightly. "Rilla was the one who reported the crime and the first to give a statement, but she never mentioned telling stories."

Zoey closed the diary. "Exactly. Everyone in the village knows each other because there are only a few dozen families. Rilla is also connected to Janet and the Lynns' daughters."

"Then let's not waste any more time. Let's go find Rilla," Jordan suggested.

They quickly gathered their things and headed to Rilla's house.

Two hours had passed since they had read the diary, and the sky was gradually darkening.

Jordan felt increasingly uneasy as they walked. "The three victims didn't seem to have any connection to Rilla. It's not like Rilla would lure them out at night to tell them stories and then kill them. She's not strong enough to hang them up."

It didn't make sense for Rilla to be the killer.

So why had she hidden the fact that she told stories when they first met her? Did she think the stories were irrelevant to the case?

Jordan's mind was a jumble of thoughts, trying to piece together the clues.

Alexander suddenly said, "Rilla is the only girl in the village who went to college."

"So? Does that mean she's a great storyteller?" Jordan's straightforwardness made Alexander chuckle.

Alexander smiled mysteriously. "Maybe enchanting stories have a kind of magic."

Jordan was confused. "What?"Soon, they arrived at Rilla's house.

Rilla was sitting in the yard, engrossed in a book. From their angle, they could see that Rilla had an air about her that set her apart from the other villagers. Now they understood why. She had a college education.

More knowledge and experiences had shaped Rilla's worldview, making her different from the rest of Willowbrook Village.

Before they could speak, Rilla noticed them. She placed a bookmark in her book and stood up slowly.

Zoey immediately recognized the book in Rilla's hand: "Little Women" by Veridian.

"Hey, What can I do for you?" Rilla greeted, trying to keep it casual.

She didn't seem surprised or nervous about their visit.

"Rilla," Alexander said politely. "We just have a few more questions about some details we might have missed last time. Is now a good time?"

Rilla glanced inside the house, as if checking on someone, then nodded. "Sure, go ahead."

Zoey took out the Lynns' daughters' diary and waved it. "You show up a lot in the Lynns' daughters' diary. They often mentioned you telling them stories. Could you tell us what kind of stories you told them? I'm curious to know what made Sadie praise you so much in her diary."

Rilla's expression remained neutral, but there was no smile. "They were just simple stories for kids who hadn't seen much of the world. Those stories would be jokes to you."

Zoey pressed on, "I like jokes."

Hearing that, Rilla felt helpless.

Rilla glanced at "Little Women" beside her chair. "Nothing special, just stories from this book. You've probably heard them before."

It was clear she was being evasive.

Alexander and the others weren't fooled by her little tricks.

They exchanged glances, and Alexander stepped forward. "Rilla, where were you between 11 PM and 3 AM on the night of the 20th?"

"At home, sleeping."

"Any witnesses?"

"I've always had my own room. My parents might count as witnesses. Our door was broken and made a lot of noise if opened. If I went out at night, my parents would know. You can ask them if they heard anything that night."

Jordan went to check the broken door. It indeed made a loud noise when opened.

If it was that loud during the day, it would be even louder at night.

Rilla was telling the truth. She had an alibi. If she had gone out, her parents and even the neighbors would have heard.

Zoey received Jordan's confirmation and turned back to Rilla. "I have a question that might seem trivial to you."

"Go ahead."

"Did they come to hear your stories together or one by one?"

Rilla replied, "Farmwork keeps people busy. Sometimes they came together, sometimes just the Lynns' daughters if Janet was busy. They'd pester me for stories."

"How many times did they come?"

"About a dozen times."

Jordan asked, "You must have become friends by then, right?"

Girls could become friends quickly, often with just a few words.

Janet and the Lynns' daughters visited often, so they must have shared a lot with Rilla.

Rilla's answer was vague. "Sort of."

###chapter 115

Zoey didn't beat around the bush. "Do you know about Faye being raped?"

Rilla's eyes widened in shock. "She never told me. How could that have happened? By who?"

"Who do you think might be connected to her death?" Zoey added.

Rilla shook her head. "I have no idea. Why are you asking me? Shouldn't you cops be handling this?"

"Besides Sadie, she spent the most time with you. When she came to hear your stories, did she ever hint at anything? Was she in a bad mood recently? Did she have any problems?"

Rilla's lips twisted into a strange smile at Zoey's questions.

Zoey wasn't sure if she was imagining things.

Rilla stared at Zoey, unsure of what to say. "I really don't know. If I had noticed anything, I would have comforted her right away. When they listened to my stories, they just listened quietly, never interrupting. But they often said, 'If only we could enter the world of the story.'"

Even if they hadn't read "Little Women," they probably knew a bit about it.

It was a story about a few tenacious women.

Alexander found it hard to connect "Little Women" with their desire to enter the story's world.

He asked, "Which part did you tell them? I'll look into it. Why would they want to go into the book's world?"

Rilla understood Alexander's point, a fleeting look of despair crossing her eyes. "Where else is not good besides Willowbrook Village?"

Alexander understood that it was about the old-fashioned views and customs that placed men above women, which were difficult to accept.

"Yeah. I get what you're saying." Zoey was about to open the copy of "Little Women" on the table when her phone buzzed.

She picked it up and saw a message from Robert.

"Officer Davis says she found Haven's phone location!"

Everyone's eyes turned to Zoey at that moment.

Compared to Alexander and Jordan, Rilla's reaction was extremely intense. "What? You found Haven?"

Zoey glanced at her calmly. "We found Haven's phone location, not Haven herself."

Rilla visibly grew more agitated. "Where is Haven?"

Her current agitation was a stark contrast to her previous calm demeanor.

Everyone looked at her with a bit of surprise, wondering if Rilla was really so close to Haven.

Zoey observed her expression closely, then put her phone away, addressing Rilla with a flat tone. "Sorry, this is a police matter. I can't share it with unrelated people."

"Haven is my friend! My only best friend for so many years. At least in my heart, I consider her my best friend. I've been worried about her for so long. I hope you can tell me."

"Enough with the fake concern."

"I'm not being fake!"

Zoey continued, "If you're not, why didn't you report it when your so-called best friend went missing?"

"I did report it!" Rilla's voice was full of anger. "It was Hugh! He told the cops I was crazy, said Haven took his money and left. The cops believed him, not me. They wouldn't file a report. What could I do?"

Mentioning Haven seemed to pull Rilla back into the past.

Her face was filled with hatred, worry, and reluctance. "Where is she? Please, tell me where Haven is!"

The more anxious Rilla got, the more satisfied Zoey felt.

People would reveal their true selves when they were desperate.

Zoey smiled slowly, locking eyes with Rilla. "You want to know about Haven? I can tell you. But I'm a cop. If I leak important information, I'll get in trouble. And I'm just an intern..."

Zoey paused deliberately.

Seeing Rilla trying to appeal to Alexander and Jordan, she brought the topic back. "Don't bother looking at them. They're interns too."

Rilla was speechless.

"But I'm braver than them. I'm not afraid of getting in trouble. But you can't expect me to do something for nothing. How about this: I'll tell you about Haven, and you give us the information we need in return." Zoey scrutinized her, speaking slowly. "Rilla, you're smart. In a place like Willowbrook Village, you should know what I want."

Rilla's agitation calmed down because of Zoey's words, but her furrowed brows didn't relax.

Zoey gave her a few seconds, but Rilla didn't seem inclined to speak.

She looked at Alexander and Jordan, waving her hand. "Let's give her some time to think. I don't like forcing people."

After the three of them left, Rilla remained standing there, motionless.

At that moment, no one but herself knew what she was thinking.

Jordan and Alexander had walked a bit away from Rilla's house when Jordan couldn't hold back any longer and asked Zoey, "Where did you find it?"

"We didn't."

"What?"

"You just said..."

Zoey was unapologetic. "I lied to her."

Jordan was stunned.

Zoey thought Jordan was a bit naive. "If there was news, Officer Davis would have posted it in the group. There's no way she'd send it just to me." Even if it was posted in the group, she'd be the last to get it.

Her old phone wasn't capable of receiving messages promptly.

Alexander was used to Zoey's tactics and just smiled quietly.

As if on cue, Zoey had just finished speaking when a message popped up in the group chat. It was from Robert: [Found Haven's phone location at Hugh's house!]

"Hugh's house?" Jordan looked at the two in surprise. "No way she left without her phone, right? Could Ava have taken it? What a terrible person."

"Let's go check it out and see what's going on."

When they arrived at Hugh's house, Robert and the rest of the crime team were questioning Ava at the door.

They were about six hundred feet away when they heard Ava's voice. "You think you can just search my house? Why? You took my son without reason, and now you want to search my home? What did we do to deserve this? And who is Haven anyway? I forgot about her long ago. It's been years. What can you find now? Our family doesn't care about her anymore. Shouldn't you be searching her place instead?"

###chapter 116

"You not only arrested Hugh but also kidnapped Evan, and now you want to search my house? Are you cops or bandits? God, can you open your eyes and give us some justice?"

"I can't take this anymore! If you keep pushing me, I'll just end it right here in front of you!"

Dennis didn't expect Ava to be so unreasonable. His patience was wearing thin. "Ava, that's not fair. If we were bandits, would we be talking to you so politely? We're just doing our job. Didn't we explain that to you? Your husband is the village chief; he should know how to cooperate with the cops. As his wife, you should set an example."

Charles, seeing Dennis's harsh tone, quickly stepped in, speaking gently and patiently. "Ava, our investigation has led us to your house. We have no personal grudge against you. Please don't think of us that way. We're just enforcing the law. We'll try our best not to damage your property. If we do, you can file a complaint and request compensation from our department."

Ava stood firmly at her door, refusing to let them in.

No matter how nicely Charles spoke, it was useless.

"I won't let you into my house! You know my husband is the village chief. You've already wronged Hugh. You were the ones being unreasonable from the start! Don't expect me to be reasonable with you! If you search my house today, I won't be able to stay in this village. I might as well be dead." Just as she finished her lament, she saw Zoey and her team approaching.

Of all the people, Ava disliked Zoey the most.

Seeing her, Ava dramatically sat on the ground, clutching the door, refusing to let them in. "As long as I'm alive, no one is getting in!"

Evan, not understanding what was happening, thought they were bullying Ava and started shouting that he would fight them.

Olivia tried to calm Evan down, but the scene quickly descended into chaos.

Zoey and her team covered the 600 feet to Robert's side quickly. "Officer Davis, where's the search warrant?"

"The chief said our evidence was insufficient and didn't approve it. He said there's no proof linking Haven to this case..." Robert's voice was low, afraid Ava might hear.

Zoey immediately understood. "Then we go in by force."

Robert glanced at her. "I was thinking the same thing."

Zoey didn't hesitate. She took a big step towards Ava, her tone cold and firm. "Ava, I'm only going to say this once. Cooperate with us and step aside."

"And if I don't? Are you going to step over my dead body?"

"Fine, if that's what you want." Zoey had a plan.

She whispered something to Dennis, who looked surprised but then nodded.

Charles, seeing them whispering, stepped forward. "What are you two planning?"

Before Charles could get an answer, Dennis walked about 60 feet away, and then got into a starting position.

Charles was confused. "What are you doing?"

Zoey confirmed, "Just watch."

Dennis calculated the distance, took a few steps back, and then sprinted forward.

Under everyone's watchful eyes, he jumped over the low wall next to Ava's house.

In the rural area, the walls weren't high, making it easy for him to get over.

Ava's attempt to guard the door seemed almost comical in comparison.

Ava was stunned.

She quickly realized what happened and ran inside to chase Dennis out.

As Ava got up, Zoey signaled Officer Davis and the others to move forward, easily stepping into the house.

Jordan was speechless.

This was the first time she'd seen something like this.

Seeing everyone else go in, she quickly followed.

Ava, seeing them all inside, realized she couldn't push them out alone.

After a while, she gave up and sat in her yard, crying loudly.

In a small village, any commotion quickly drew attention.

Soon, neighbors gathered outside to see what was happening.

The investigation team, under pressure, searched the house thoroughly but found nothing.

Zoey was close to tearing the house apart but still couldn't find Haven's phone.

Everyone watched her aggressive search in disbelief.

"This is strange," Robert said, stopping first and looking around the room. "The tech team can't be wrong. The address is Ava's house. It has to be here. But where's the phone?"

Zoey, unable to find anything, had to stop.

Ava was inconsolable, crying from the yard to the house.

Evan and Olivia tried to comfort her, but it was no use. Ava's cries only grew louder.

Zoey turned her attention to Evan and walked over. "Hey, Spider-Man, I have a question for you."

Evan liked the nickname and looked up at her. "What is it? I am happy to help."

"Do you have any treasure in your house?"

Ava, hearing this, glared and started cursing. "How shameless can you be? Asking my son where our money is. Can't you live on your police salary? If not, quit your job! Beg me, and maybe I'll pity you and let you work in my son's factory!"

Her harsh words echoed in Zoey's ears, but she ignored them, calmly looking at Evan.

Evan thought for a moment, then his eyes lit up. "Haha, I know! The treasure is hidden!"

"Where is it hidden?"

Evan started to speak but then covered his mouth. "No. It's our secret. I can't tell anyone. No one can know."

Jordan was losing patience. "Who is this? The culprit must be really clever to get a fool to keep a secret and not spill it. That's impressive."

"Who are you calling a fool?" Ava wouldn't let anyone insult Evan and cursed back.

###chapter 117

Jordan knew better than to mess with Ava, so she quickly apologized.

No matter how much Ava yelled at her, she chose not to talk back.

Eventually, Ava got tired of yelling and stopped.

Zoey's eyes scanned every corner of Ava's house. They had searched everywhere.

They still hadn't found Haven's phone.

But Zoey was certain it was in Ava's house, because the tech department rarely made mistakes.

As long as the battery was still in, they could locate the phone.

Haven had been divorced from Hugh for years. A phone battery unused for that long would be dead, and the number would be deactivated. But since the cops could track the phone, it meant Haven's phone had been used frequently over the past five years.

Who had been using Haven's phone all this time?

First, she ruled out Evan because he wasn't smart enough.

Next, she ruled out Ava because her reaction seemed genuine, and the village chief, who was far away, was also unlikely.

That left Hugh and Olivia as the main suspects.

Based on this analysis, Hugh seemed the most suspicious.

Whether it was the semen found in the body or his disgusting personality, Hugh had the biggest motive. But why would he keep Haven's phone?

He looked down on women, so what could be on Haven's phone that he needed to study for so long?

Zoey suddenly noticed Olivia wasn't inside.

The door was open, and she could see Olivia sitting in the yard, lost in thought, which behavior was quite unusual.

Ava was inside, crying and making a scene, while Olivia had come out alone.

The detectives were reviewing their search, noting what they had and hadn't checked, and no one noticed Zoey slipping away.

Zoey walked over to Olivia.

Olivia quickly noticed her. "Officer Brown, are you done? Did you find anything?"

Zoey replied, "Ava's been crying and making a fuss. Why did you stop trying to calm her down?"

"She is just like that. She just wants to protect this family. Officer Brown, please don't blame her. She loves this family too much."

"Alright, we've almost finished searching. You can go inside and check for any damage. You can apply for compensation later."

"It's fine, there's nothing in the house that needs compensation."

Zoey looked at Olivia's seemingly understanding face and gave her a faint smile. "You should go inside."

But Olivia didn't want to leave the yard. She looked up at the sky, deep in thought. "I want to stay outside for a while."

"You're not going inside?"

"No."

Zoey respected her decision and called out to Alexander.

Alexander heard Zoey and came out. "What's up?"

Zoey pointed to the chicken coop in the yard. "Go check the chicken coop."

They were all interns, and every time Zoey gave an order, Alexander followed it smoothly.

It was as if Zoey was the leader of the detective team.

Alexander was puzzled. "What?"

Olivia, with her unreadable expression, also looked at Alexander.

Compared to Olivia's hard-to-read face, Alexander's reaction was more straightforward. He walked over to Zoey with a serious expression. "Stop joking."

"I'm not joking. I suspect there's a phone in the chicken coop. Is that a problem?"

Alexander had never done such a thing before.

Every time Zoey asked for help, he was willing to assist.

This time, he asked Zoey, "Why don't you do it yourself?"

"It's too dirty."

Alexander was so frustrated he almost ground his teeth. "You think I don't mind the dirt?"

"You're different."

"How am I different?" Alexander was about to argue.

Zoey said, "Aren't you a good guy? Can't you help with this?"

Alexander was speechless. Since when was he a good guy?

He didn't say anything and stood still.

Zoey saw he wasn't moving and pulled him towards the chicken coop. Unexpectedly, Olivia stepped in front of them, blocking their way.

Her smile was unnatural, even stiff. "Officer Brown, do you want some eggs? I can get you some, but if I take too many, Ava will scold me."

"Sorry, I don't want eggs. I just want to see what's inside the chicken coop."

"It's full of chicken poop, dirty and smelly."

"Really? I like looking at chicken poop."

Olivia was speechless.

Zoey hated wasting time. She was a straightforward person, and if the other person was too, she was happy to work with them.

If not, she preferred using force.

Like now, she really wanted to push Olivia aside.

Zoey took a step towards the chicken coop, and Olivia's nervousness was written all over her face.

Zoey saw Olivia was deliberately blocking her and became even more curious about the chicken coop, realizing there must be something hidden inside.

Zoey was losing patience, and Alexander noticed Olivia's odd behavior.

While Olivia was entangled with Zoey, he went straight to the chicken coop, not caring about the dirt, and reached inside.

Olivia watched in horror as Alexander dug into the chicken coop.

She shouted, "No!" and tried to stop him.

Zoey didn't give her the chance. She grabbed Olivia's wrist and held her back.

Olivia's strength was no match for Zoey's.

She was firmly restrained. "Let me go!"

Zoey easily held her in place. The more anxious Olivia became, the happier Zoey was.

Anxiety meant there was definitely something hidden inside!

"What's the problem? If the eggs break, we'll pay you back at market price!" Zoey mocked.

"No, let me go." Olivia struggled but couldn't break free. She gradually gave up, watching Alexander dig into the chicken coop with growing despair. "Why? How did you know?"

Zoey replied nonchalantly, "Your expression gave you away. I was just guessing, but your reaction was too big."

Olivia gave a sarcastic smile. "Your guess was spot on."

Zoey took it as a compliment and smiled naturally. "Not bad." She kept an eye on Alexander.

Alexander's white shirt was now dirty, but he didn't mind. He was getting more excited.

Soon, he waved a small metal box at Zoey. "Found it!"

Olivia collapsed to the ground.

Zoey, seeing her despair, let go.

Alexander immediately went to wash his hands, careful not to damage any fingerprints on the box.

Zoey put on gloves and took the box, glancing inside. Robert and the others were coming out.

Charles saw the dirty, smelly box in Zoey's hands and asked, "What's that, Zoey?"

"The evidence we were looking for," Zoey said with a smirk.

Everyone was shocked.

They had searched for so long, and Zoey found it just like that.

Dennis looked at the filthy Alexander. "Did you dig in the chicken coop?"

Alexander nodded. "Yes, I did."

The others, smelling the chicken poop on him, pinched their noses in disgust.

###chapter 118

Robert felt a surge of pride as he patted Alexander on the shoulder. "Nice job, Alex. You deserve to be my student!"

Alexander was speechless.

Zoey wiped the dirt off the metal box and slowly opened it.

Inside, there was nothing but an old smartphone and a thick syringe, the kind used in hospitals, but without a needle.

The phone was definitely Haven's, but what was the syringe for?

Zoey walked over to Robert and whispered a few words. Robert nodded and turned to Olivia, who was still sitting on the floor, dazed. "Olivia, we need you to come with us."

Olivia stiffened and nodded.

She stood up compliantly, mimicking the way criminals surrendered on TV, holding her wrists together as if waiting for handcuffs.

Robert glanced at her awkwardly. "No need for that, at least for now."

As they were about to leave, Evan burst out of the room. "Olivia, I want to watch TV. Can you put on Spider-Man for me?"

Olivia replied, "Ask Mom to put it on for you."

Evan agreed, tilting his head as he looked at Olivia and the cops. He didn't understand why Olivia was with them. Remembering Zoey's earlier talk about catching aliens, he asked curiously, "Olivia, are you going with them to catch aliens? If so, I won't watch cartoons. I'll come too. Wait, I'll turn into Spider-Man now!"

Olivia was speechless.

Zoey and Charles exchanged a glance, both thinking the same thing without saying a word.

Evan was 'transforming,' ready to follow them.

Seeing this, Olivia quickly shouted, "Mom, Evan wants to go out. Keep an eye on him!"

Ava, still crying, had no idea what was happening outside.

It wasn't until she heard Evan's name that she came out.

She acted as if she didn't see Olivia, coaxing Evan back inside and closing the door tightly.

She didn't even ask Olivia a single question.

Robert, having spent the past few days in Willowbrook Village, was used to its 'customs' by now.

He figured Olivia must be used to it too.

Without any further comfort, he said, "Let's go."

Olivia was led out of the house, heading towards the church.

Zoey noticed Alexander's hand awkwardly hanging in the air. She asked, "Is it really that dirty?"

They were at the back of the group, unnoticed by the others.

Alexander, no longer bothering to hide his irritation, replied, "What do you think? If it wasn't, why did you make me go?"

Zoey thought to herself, 'To annoy you, of course.'

But she said, "Because you're a man. You're quicker and can handle tough situations better."

Hearing that, Alexander smiled slightly.

"Are you happy now that I praised you? Smiling so much," Zoey continued, seeing Alexander's face darkened even more. "I remember you didn't resist this much when you went into the sewer to find body parts."

Alexander retorted, "How do you know I didn't?"

"Why be a cop if you're such a neat freak?"

"Why be a cop if you're so broke?"

Their voices might have been a bit loud, catching Charles's attention.

Charles turned around, seeing their tense expressions. "Are you walking so slowly just to argue?"

Alexander instantly put on a natural smile. "Of course not. Zoey and I get along great."

Zoey couldn't stand Alexander's two-faced behavior and sneered, "You're really full of yourself."

Charles raised an eyebrow. "Indeed."

'So, what's their deal?' Charles thought.

At the church, they had Olivia wait in a small room while the detectives examined the metal box in another room.

The box was just a regular tin, usually for storing candy.

Robert separated the syringe and phone, placing them in evidence bags. He handed the bag with the syringe to a colleague heading to the lab for analysis.

Zoey, wearing gloves, turned on the phone. To her surprise, it powered up.

Jordan was astonished. "It turned on!"

The phone's wallpaper was a scenic ocean view. There weren't many apps, all visible on one screen.

Zoey immediately opened the photo gallery, finding many selfies of Haven and some with Rilla.

After viewing the photos, Zoey opened Facebook.

Haven had very few friends, less than ten, with Rilla being the only frequent contact.

She expected many messages between them but found very few.

Zoey scrolled to the beginning and quickly understood why.

This was Rilla's old phone. Haven, an orphan, had been liked by Hugh while working at his factory.

After moving to Willowbrook Village, she led a monotonous life with no social interactions, friends, or relatives.

Hugh had smashed her phone and refused to buy her a new one, saying she didn't need to contact anyone as an orphan.

But Haven, being young, still wanted to use a phone, even if it had nothing on it.

She secretly used the phone without Hugh knowing.

When Haven met Rilla, she had been married to Hugh for several years.

Rilla, home from college during breaks, would chat with Haven, easing her loneliness.

They talked all day, so there were few Facebook records.

But one day, their conversations changed, focusing on Haven's anxiety about having children.

Haven: [Why haven't I gotten pregnant after all these years?]

Haven: [I told Ava I wanted to see a doctor, but she wouldn't let me.]

Haven: [I know Hugh has a woman outside. I don't mind, but if she gets pregnant first, Hugh won't want me anymore. What will I do then? I'll be an orphan again...]

Rilla always cared for Haven, offering comfort and advice.

Their conversations about having children took up about 80% of the Facebook records.

Then one day, Haven stopped caring about having children. When Rilla asked, she would brush it off with a smile.

Rilla, being considerate, stopped asking.

They then talked mostly about the future, with Rilla often mentioning the beautiful ocean and sending Haven many photos.

Haven, after seeing the ocean photos, wanted to go with Rilla.

They promised to visit the beach together someday.

But after that, Haven disappeared. No matter what Rilla sent, she never replied.

Zoey exited Facebook and checked other apps, including notes and social media, but found nothing useful.

Dennis, still confused after reading the Facebook records, asked, "What's worth hiding in a chicken coop? There's nothing here."

###chapter 119

"Well..." Charles paused, thinking. "Do you think Olivia hid the phone because she doesn't have one? Maybe she wanted to use it herself but was scared Ava would find out, so she stashed it in the chicken coop?"

Dennis considered this. It was true, Olivia didn't seem to have a phone.

Dennis was even more frustrated. "Is Hugh out of his mind? He's loaded but can't even get Olivia a phone? Anyone who marries into that family is cursed."

"Still not used to it?" Zoey scoffed. "Who knows how long their village customs have been around? They've worked so hard to keep women down, they can't let them see the outside world. These women aren't dumb; they've just been brainwashed since they were kids to believe everything their parents say. The best way to control them is to keep them from seeing the outside world."

" Damn it!" Charles was so angry his hands were shaking.

Robert chimed in, "If Olivia was using the phone, our only hope is that syringe."

Everyone had just seen a glimmer of hope, only to feel it slipping away again.

They all sighed in unison.

Robert looked at his team and said, "Why so down? Remember, bad people always leave evidence behind when they do bad things."

Zoey agreed with Robert, so she opened the photo album again to see if there were any other clues.

Jordan suddenly spoke up, "Zoey, stop looking at those. We've gone through them countless times. Check if there's a hidden album."

Zoey's phone was old, and she had been using it for years.

She had no idea phones had evolved so much.

Plus, she was a total tech novice and had no clue how to use her phone properly.

"Huh? You don't know? Your phone doesn't have a hidden album?" Jordan asked, taking the phone from Zoey's surprised hands. "Alright, let me do it."

Jordan fiddled with the phone for a bit.

She actually found a hidden album. "Haha, I found it!"

Zoey leaned in and saw that Jordan had indeed found several albums she hadn't seen before. She was astonished.

In the hidden album, there was only one video. The thumbnail was pitch black, revealing nothing.

Zoey had a strange feeling that this video held the key to everything.

"My name is Haven."

The screen flickered, revealing a dim figure in a dark background. It was hard to tell where she was. The only light came from her phone, faintly illuminating her tear-streaked face.

"I..." She stared at herself on the phone for a long time, trying to speak but stopping each time, just crying.

"When you see this video, I will definitely be dead. If not, I'm on my way to die." She finally spoke a complete sentence, shocking everyone.

She then began to recount her experiences over the years, "I've been an orphan since I was a child. I never felt what it was like to have a family. But after I met Hugh, he gave me that feeling. You might not understand if you're not an orphan, but having a family was something I longed for all these years. I thought I finally had a home, and I was willing to give everything, even my life, to cherish it."

"Hugh loved me a lot at first. He promised me a future, a beautiful life, but it was all a trap to keep me in a place where every day was dark and hopeless. I knew how hard it was to have a family, so I accepted it. Because I loved him, I could accept anything. I could accept the villagers' discrimination because I was an orphan. They never liked me. I could see it in their eyes; they only saw me as a joke."

"I didn't want to be an orphan, but was it my choice? Why did they treat me like this? I don't know. I thought I was doing my best to maintain this family, but Ava was never satisfied. No matter what I did, she always scolded me. I know I'm clumsy, but I was really trying to learn. The other women who married into the village told me they bullied me because I was an orphan and had no one to help me. But I couldn't understand. Should I blame Hugh for not protecting me, or my parents for making me an orphan? I couldn't figure it out."

"I couldn't tell which reason hurt more. Everyone hated me; no one liked me. I thought maybe if I had a child with Hugh, things would change. But God played a cruel joke on me. Years passed, and I still wasn't pregnant. Now, not only did Ava hate me, but even Hugh started to lose patience with me. I always thought it was my fault, feeling guilty for not giving Hugh a son. I treated them even better. But the truth was, it wasn't my fault. It was Hugh's!"

"They all knew Hugh was the problem but kept it a secret. They even made me sleep with Evan. I couldn't take it anymore. How could they say such things? Even if Evan wasn't mentally mature, this wasn't ethical. Even an uneducated woman like me knew it was wrong, but they insisted I had to do it for the family."

"I was going crazy, but I couldn't let go of this family. I did some research and found out that children born from someone with a mental disability would also be disabled. I didn't want to sleep with Evan; I was afraid I wouldn't be able to face myself or Hugh. I hoped Hugh would help me, but he told me to die! I told him many times that children born from someone with a mental disability would also be disabled. Hugh slapped me and kept hiding the fact that Evan was born with a mental disability. Because Evan's father was the village chief, he didn't allow the truth to spread. They all said Evan became disabled from a fever when he was young, but I knew he was born that way! Hugh seemed to have found out the truth and stopped forcing me to have a child with Evan."

"I thought I had finally escaped, but they were too terrifying. It wasn't me who couldn't have children; it was Hugh. They didn't give Hugh any medicine but forced me to take all kinds of drugs, trying countless disgusting methods! They even said, besides the two sons, there was another one who could have children, referring to Hugh's father. Besides Evan, Ava and Hugh were all accomplices!"

Haven's eyes grew more crazed as she spoke, her eyes bloodshot with hatred, even in the dark background.

It was clear what she had gone through that day.

Hugh must have held her down while his father raped her.

"They're all lunatics! Why did I marry into this family? Just because I'm an orphan, is it my fault? Why do they treat me like this? Why do I have to suffer this way? In their eyes, I'm not even human."

###chapter 120

"I can't tell Rilla. I'm scared she'll hate me. I'm so sad. Ever since Hugh let his dad hurt me, they've been keeping a close eye on me, not letting me go anywhere. No matter where I go, Ava's always right behind me."

"The only thing that makes me happy is talking to Rilla, but even then, Ava's there. I don't get why they're following me. Are they scared I'll spill the beans about the awful stuff they've done to me? I will, I swear, if it comes to that. They don't need to do this. I have nowhere to go if I leave them. I have no money, nothing. Hugh's never given me anything."

"Ava even told me she's had a bunch of abortions and once abandoned a newborn girl. She said if I have a girl, I should abandon her too. When I heard that, I wondered if my parents ditched me because I was a girl. Is that why?"

"I always thought of myself as a happy, positive person. Being an orphan didn't matter, even if my parents didn't want me. At least they didn't abort me; they brought me into this world. But now, after everything I've been through, all I feel is hate. If they didn't love me, why didn't they just kill me sooner? Why make me go through all this? I'd rather be dead. Maybe they should have never let me live. I hate my parents now, I really do."

"I wonder if I did something terrible in a past life to deserve being born a woman in this one. Would things be different if I were a man?"

"The other night, Hugh forced me to sleep with his dad again. Just seeing his dad's face makes me sick. Before, he would just have sex with me, but now it's worse. He kisses me, touches me, even licks my pussy. He makes disgusting comments about my body. I can't take it anymore. I tried to fight back, but I was too weak. He licked me all over while raping me. I wanted to throw up."

"When I got back to my room after being with Hugh's dad, Hugh wasn't home yet. I lay down and threw up. I thought it was because I was so disgusted, but I was wrong. I've been throwing up a lot lately. I don't need a test to know I'm probably pregnant."

"I have a feeling it's a girl. Ava won't let her be born, and I won't either. I can't protect her; I can't even protect myself. Even if I did protect her, would she end up like me when she grows up? I don't want my daughter to suffer in this world. Death is the best choice for her while she can't feel pain or sadness."

"Rilla once told me that everyone's fate is different, but death is fair. Everyone dies, rich or poor, young or old. If I'm going to die eventually, why not now? Why suffer?"

"I want to die right now, but I can't bear to leave Rilla. She's my best friend. We promised to see the ocean together someday. We made so many beautiful plans, but will they ever happen to me? I don't believe they will. They never will."

"Rilla, I'm going ahead. I didn't want to record this video, but I realized if I just died, there would be no trace of me left in this world. I know you might never see this, and no one might ever find it. But Rilla, you're the best friend I've ever had. I can't hold on anymore. I hope you can forgive me."

"I've been having these dreams lately, and someone keeps telling me to go with them. I can't see their face, but I feel like it's a good place, better than where I am now. I've decided to go with them, to leave forever."

The video ended.

Haven's sobs faded, but everyone who watched the video fell into silence.

This 'suicide note' made everyone feel her pain firsthand.

Without this video, everyone might have thought Haven just left, not that she committed suicide.

Compared to the other women in Willowbrook Village, Zoey couldn't even judge Haven.

She seemed clear-headed, yet she did something so tragic.

At such a young age, she chose to end everything with suicide.

Zoey stared at the video, unable to snap out of it, thinking when the bias against women would end.

Although Haven committed suicide, the detectives wished, even for a moment, that Hugh and his family had been the ones to kill her.

The real culprits couldn't be brought to justice!

"So, this video is useless, right?" Zoey returned to the case, her cold voice contrasting sharply with the others' complex expressions.

It was as if she had just watched an ordinary video.

Jordan's heavy heart hadn't lightened. Seeing Zoey speak first, she sighed deeply, "At least we know what happened to Haven, even though..."

But at least they knew if she was alive or not.

Robert thought he'd seen enough to not get angry over these things, but he was wrong.

After hearing Haven's story, even as a cop, he wanted to kill everyone who had hurt Haven.

But he couldn't do that. He sighed heavily and looked at his team. "Alright, we don't know if the syringe will help, but we can start by taking Olivia's statement."

"I'll go!" Zoey volunteered immediately.

Robert didn't refuse. "Alright, let's go."

When they entered, Olivia was asleep at the table.

Robert cleared his throat, but Olivia didn't wake up.

Zoey had to nudge her awake. "Olivia? Wake up."

Olivia wasn't deeply asleep. She yawned and slowly lifted her head, looking at them with drooping eyes.

Robert looked at Olivia, thought for a moment, and decided to try a different approach. "Olivia, we know everything. We're willing to give you a chance to come clean. It's up to you if you want to take it. You can also choose to say nothing. It's your choice."

###chapter 121

Olivia's face turned anxious when she heard this, and she shifted uncomfortably in her seat.

It was clear that any drowsiness she had was now gone.

Robert and Zoey exchanged a glance, understanding each other without words.

They quietly observed her expression.

If it were someone with strong mental fortitude, someone who grew up in a big city, it might be hard to get them to reveal the truth with just a few words. They wouldn't believe Robert's words.

But Olivia was different. She had never seen much of the world, barely even watched TV, and spent most of her time on household chores.

She was just an inexperienced country girl.

Olivia's eyes were filled with deep sorrow as she slowly began to speak, "I... I'll tell you everything..."

After thinking for a moment, she asked with a sob in her voice, "Sir, will I be executed?"

Robert didn't understand why she would ask such a question. Haven had committed suicide. Why would she be executed?

But he remained calm on the surface, "It depends on whether what you tell us is true and if it helps with our investigation."

Olivia nodded, understanding somewhat. She looked down for a second, then asked, "I don't know where to start..."

Robert felt a bit of pity for this naive country girl and gently prompted, "Start with the phone."

"Okay." Olivia seemed to be organizing her thoughts. She began timidly, "I found this phone when I married Hugh. I had asked Hugh to buy me a phone before, but Ava and Hugh scolded me. They were afraid I would use the phone to flirt with people. No matter how much I explained that I wouldn't, they didn't believe me and said awful things. I just saw that many people in the village had one, but I had nothing."

"Even Evan had one. Ava told me that when I got older and had a child for the family, they would buy me one. She said it so firmly that I didn't dare bring it up again. Every time I did, they would scold me terribly."

"I just wanted a phone, but they insult me like that. One day, I found this phone by accident and played with it when they weren't around. I didn't even know how to turn it on and spent a long time figuring it out. Later, I watched how Hugh used it and learned how to charge it."

Robert listened intently for a while, realizing she was rambling.

He couldn't take it anymore and knocked on the table to interrupt her, "Get to the point."

Olivia nodded, "I found a video on the phone while messing around with it. You must have seen it already."

"Yes."

Olivia's face showed fear as she thought about Haven's video.

"At first, I was puzzled why I hadn't gotten pregnant after all these years. After watching the video, I realized it wasn't my fault. I tried to convince Hugh to go to the hospital with me for a check-up, but he refused and scolded me. He had already been through several wives who couldn't have children, yet he still blamed others. Initially, I thought Haven's words were unbelievable, but one day, I overheard Hugh's parents talking..."

"From the day I married in, they planned to treat me like they did Haven. Haven's suicide made them hesitate. Ava said Haven wanted to die, and no one could stop her, but they had to think about the next generation. Hugh's father said that when he returned from his trip, he would rape me." Olivia's hands clenched tightly as she spoke.

She exhaled deeply, "I was really scared of becoming the next Haven. While Hugh's father was away, I tried my best to please Hugh and Ava, hoping they wouldn't treat me like that."

"One time, I overheard Ava talking to Hugh's father on the phone, asking about me. I realized they are still heartless and still planned to treat me like Haven."

Olivia's eyes filled with hatred, "Maybe Hugh's first wife went through the same thing."

Zoey raised an eyebrow, clearly tired of hearing her ramble.

She bluntly asked, "What does this have to do with the murder?"

"I didn't kill anyone." Olivia stood up, agitated, "I really didn't kill anyone! I just wanted to frame Hugh as a rapist to get him sent to prison. If he was in prison, Hugh's father wouldn't treat me like that."

Robert quickly caught the inconsistency in her story and asked, "How did you frame him? What preparations did you make? Tell us."

Olivia looked at the calm police officers in front of her, and her emotions gradually settled, "I didn't kill anyone... I really didn't."

"Did you find the bodies already dead that night?"

"Yes! They were already dead!" Olivia looked up, tears in her eyes, "I was so scared, but I didn't kill them!"

Zoey, seeing her so agitated, thought she didn't seem like she was lying, and continued, "Tell us about finding the bodies."

"Okay," Olivia said, "Evan often sneaks out to play, and Ava doesn't know. I didn't know at first either. But one day, when I was cleaning his room, I caught him sneaking out. When he saw me, he made a 'shh' gesture, asking me not to alert Ava, or she wouldn't let him go catch aliens."

"I kept trying to stop Evan, but he insisted on going. I was afraid something would happen, so I tried to keep an eye on him. But as soon as I turned my back, he ran off. When he came back that night, he told me he found aliens! I asked him what aliens were, and he took me to the church. I thought it was just some ordinary thing, but I saw three people hanging from the church rafters. I was scared to the extreme!"

"I sat on the ground for a long time before I could react. I thought Evan had hung them up as a prank. I was afraid something would happen, so I told Evan to take them down immediately. I called their names, but there was no response. That's when I realized that they were dead, all of them were dead bodies in front of me."

###chapter 122

"I really don't want anything to do with this because I didn't kill anyone. Seriously, I didn't. I had no beef with them, so why would I kill them? But I was especially scared someone might've seen me with Evan that night. I was worried people would suspect me, so I asked Evan not to tell anyone we were together. He agreed, and we went home."

"I saw something that really freaked me out. I couldn't sleep all night. Later that night, Hugh came back, stinking of booze. He didn't care about my state and just forced himself on me, saying he had a bad time with some woman outside and needed to feel good with me."

"I was already scared, and Haven's video kept playing in my mind. Seeing Hugh on top of me, I was so fed up with him. Suddenly, an idea popped into my head. I coaxed him into wearing a condom, saying that drinking and getting pregnant would be bad for the baby. He might have some issues in that area because he loves hearing about having kids. He put it on right away."

"Then I went to Evan's room and got a syringe. After cleaning it, I extracted the contents from the condom and, while Hugh was asleep, injected the liquid into the bodies. I just wanted Hugh to get caught. That's why I did it. I didn't mean to. I just hate this family so much."

"To avoid getting involved, I threw the ropes they used to hang themselves into the river. Evan and I casually placed the chair we used to lower the bodies in front of someone's house. Most of the chairs in our village looked the same, so no one could tell whose it was. I wanted to throw away the syringe too, but I was afraid Evan would cry and fuss if he couldn't find his toy, so I kept it."

"Whenever Evan cried, Ava would scold me, so I hid it. I only took it out when Evan asked for it. I just wanted to teach Hugh a lesson. I didn't think of anything else. Really, you have to believe me."

Robert and Zoey's brows were furrowed the whole time. They were both at a loss for words.

Zoey thought this situation was too absurd. "I'm really curious. How did you suddenly think of injecting Hugh's semen into the three female corpses? Where did you get that idea?"

Olivia replied, "I... it just came to me. Wasn't it a good idea? You arrested Hugh because the semen in the bodies was his."

Zoey and Robert were speechless.

Robert knew this lead was a dead end. Olivia wasn't the killer.

He took a deep breath. "Alright, at least we know how the semen got into the bodies. You were the first to discover the crime scene, right? No, it should be Evan." He remembered Evan wasn't normal and corrected himself. "Never mind, same difference."

For the first time, Zoey felt a bit frustrated and wanted to curse.

Olivia's actions had led the police investigation further away from the real killer.

"Olivia, do you know how much your actions have misled and affected our investigation?" Zoey said.

Olivia still looked innocently at Zoey. She clearly didn't care about that and instead asked, "So... will I be executed?"

Zoey was about to explode. "You'll go to prison!"

Olivia, realizing she wouldn't be executed but would go to prison, immediately brightened up, even smiling with relief. "Does that mean I can leave here?"

Robert, seeing how eager she was to leave, felt a bit helpless. "You're happy about going to prison?"

"It's better than being here. Sir, can I ask, do I have to do housework in prison?"

"No, you just need to take care of your own things."

"Do I have to do farm work? Like getting up before dawn every day?"

"No farm work, but it's much easier than that. You'll also have to attend educational sessions."

"Educational sessions?" Olivia, who hadn't been to school, didn't understand what that meant and was surprised. "I can study in prison?"

Robert didn't know how to describe Olivia anymore. "Yes, sort of."

"Are you sure this is prison? It sounds like a happy life."

Robert was speechless.

He explained further, "Prison will restrict your freedom. Besides eating, attending classes, working, and sleeping, the living conditions aren't as good as at home. But the most important thing is that having a criminal record will follow you for life."

The more Olivia listened, the happier she got, smiling genuinely. "Sir, I really think this isn't a prison. For me, it's a better life. At home, even without handcuffs, I'm not free. Every morning, I'm afraid of waking up late and missing breakfast. No matter how well I cook, Ava scolds me. And after breakfast, I have to work in the fields. At night, when I finally get to rest, Ava nags me about having a son."

"I know a woman can only have one husband and can't share him. But I don't care anymore because caring won't change anything. I don't regret marrying Hugh because if it wasn't him, it would be someone else. All women born here have the same fate. At least Hugh didn't let me starve. I ate better than most."

Robert looked at her, puzzled. "If you don't regret marrying him, why frame him?"

"Because they're all crazy! No matter how much I give, they won't be moved. In their world, it's all about having children to carry on the family name. Just thinking about it drives me mad. I want to kill him!" Olivia's voice grew louder, contrasting with her usual demeanor.

After venting, she calmed down. "But I'm not as heartless as them. Sometimes I regret my cowardice. If I were braver, I would have killed the whole family!"

###chapter 123

"I've always wanted to get away from this family, but when I think about my parents, I just can't do it. Everyone in the village knows each other. If I run away, my parents will lose all their dignity. Framing Hugh was a crazy moment, but while he was gone, I was actually happy. As long as he's not around, even if his dad comes back, I won't be scared! Without Hugh, his dad wouldn't dare touch me, and I could finally have some peace."

"And what did you get out of it? Do you regret it?" Zoey had seen plenty of fools, but facing someone who had been foolish along with her parents since childhood, she couldn't bring herself to hate her. "You gained nothing and say you don't regret it. How stupid. You've just moved from one prison to another."

"It's different. If I go to jail, Hugh won't want me anymore, and I'll be free. I won't have to endure Hugh's family's maltreatment.  I won't resist, I'm not as brave as Haven. She had the guts to choose another path, but I didn't. I'm weak, I can't be ruthless, but this time, I was forced to choose. I can't bear to leave others, so I'll let others leave me. It's good. As long as I get away from Hugh, I can go to the city to work. Anywhere is better than being a slave here, treated like a breeding machine."

As she spoke, a smile unknowingly crept onto her lips, and her eyes were filled with hope and dreams for the future.

She seemed like a completely different person, transformed from a lifeless, timid girl into someone vibrant and alive.

"None of this matters to me," Zoey said. "Congrats, you've gotten smarter."

Olivia was puzzled. "What?"

"Although you haven't completely freed yourself from your old mindset, at least you dare to resist," Zoey said, feeling somewhat relieved. "It's better to find a new way to live than to force yourself to endure. Of course, breaking free from a cage always comes at a price."

Olivia listened for a long time, unable to understand what Zoey meant.

After thinking for a while, she decided to ask: "Ma'am, are you praising me?"

"Praising you?" Zoey laughed at her foolishness. "I thought I was just speaking normally."

Hearing that, Olivia felt speechless.

Robert thought Zoey was amazing. No matter who she faced, he had never seen her flatter or praise anyone. To avoid hitting Olivia, who was trying to start anew, too hard, he coughed skillfully and interrupted their conversation. "Alright, from now on, make sure to turn over a new leaf. Study hard in prison, learn more, and become someone who can adapt to normal society."

"Okay," Olivia agreed readily, then asked, "Sir, can I ask you a favor? Can you help me talk to Hugh and my parents about the divorce?"

"You and Hugh don't even have a marriage certificate. How can you divorce?" Robert's words brought Olivia back to reality.

She suddenly remembered, right, they had been married for years without a certificate.

Thinking she didn't need to see Hugh and his family again, Olivia felt great.

Robert told Olivia to go home and pack up, and they would come to pick her up later.

Olivia looked at Zoey, wanting to say something but hesitating.

Zoey noticed and said, "If you have something to say, just say it."

"Well... I don't know if this is related to you, but there's something I didn't mention before."

"Then say it."

"Okay." Olivia swallowed. "It's just Hugh and his family have done a lot of disgusting things, and only I know. When I found out Janet was going to marry Evan, I was afraid she'd end up like me, so I secretly told her to run away if she could."

Robert frowned, "Why are you only telling us this important clue now?"

"Is it very important? I couldn't say it before, Ava was watching me closely. I just remembered suddenly. If it's important, you can investigate further. If not, that's even better."

"Alright, thank you for the clue." Robert resolved Olivia's matter but didn't feel any happier.

The entire investigation team seemed to be under a cloud-

All their previous deductions now had to be re-evaluated and re-investigated.

Apart from Chad being caught for his actions with the three female corpses, Hugh's case still needed further investigation.

After going in circles, the case was back to square one, without progress at all.

Charles saw his colleagues looking dejected and tried to lighten the mood. "At least we know half of it now. The truth is close. I believe we'll find out soon."

Dennis yawned, his dark circles prominent, and even in his police uniform, he no longer looked sharp and spirited.

Sitting on the steps, he couldn't help but sigh, "I kind of want to go back to Emerald City."

For the first time, Zoey felt a connection with Dennis. She also wanted to go back, desperately.

Maybe it was the old-fashioned mindset in this village that made it unbearable. No matter who she saw in the village, she felt inexplicably irritated.

If she talked to anyone for too long, she felt like hitting them.

In such an atmosphere, it was easy to feel oppressed and powerless.

Not to mention the girls born here, even she was finding it harder and harder to endure.

Emerald City was busy, but every day was bustling with people, and everyone she met was educated and had the right mindset. It wasn't as mentally exhausting to interact with them.

Soon, night fell.

Another day passed quietly.

After finishing their work, the group walked from the church to the parking area. Passing by Faye's house, they heard a child crying inside.

The crying was heart-wrenching, as if the child had suffered a great injustice.

"What's going on?" Dennis was the first to stop and look inside.

The group also stopped.

Robert stepped forward and knocked on the door, but there was no response. The child's crying grew more intense. Zoey, fearing the adults weren't home, kicked the door.

The first kick didn't open it, so she kicked again.

The loud noise quickly attracted Cinda.

She opened the door, eyes filled with panic, but relaxed when he saw the familiar officers: "Oh, it's you. What's the matter?"

Robert glanced towards the source of the crying. "Why is your son crying so badly? What's going on?"

###chapter 124

"Hey, did we bother you?" Cinda asked, confused. Her house was pretty far from the church. Could the crying really be that loud?

Cinda felt a bit embarrassed. "I'm really sorry about that. I'll go talk to him right away."

"It didn't really bother us. What's going on with your kid? He's been crying a lot."

Cinda sighed, feeling helpless. "My son is getting older, and he can't keep sharing a room with me. I wanted him to move into Faye's room, but he refused, saying Faye would be mad. I accidentally let it slip that Faye wasn't coming back, and he just kept asking questions and crying."

He was almost in middle school. He should understand what Cinda meant.

Everyone sighed at the family's misfortune, except for the cold-hearted Zoey, who was focused on something else. "Are you planning to throw away their stuff?"

"Some things we won't throw away. We'll keep them as mementos. Their clothes and books will stay and some other things will be buried with them."

"Can I take a look inside?"

"Of course." Cinda didn't understand why Zoey wanted to see the things for the burial, but she agreed.

The others followed Zoey into Cinda's house. It was so small that the room was crowded with everyone inside.

To avoid causing a scene, only Zoey and Alexander went in, while the others waited outside.

Alexander and Zoey had previously investigated Faye and Sadie's room. This time, it was noticeably emptier, with many things gone.

A cardboard box held some items, and Finn was lying on the bed, crying loudly.

Hearing someone enter, Finn thought it was Cinda. He looked up angrily but saw Zoey instead. He was about to say something but fell silent.

Zoey glanced at him and then turned her attention to the rest of the room.

Alexander, feeling sorry for Finn, tried to comfort him. "Don't cry. Crying at night isn't good for you. You'll get sick."

Zoey's eyes were drawn to the table. She scanned it but didn't find what she was looking for. Then she noticed a piggy bank. She reached for it.

Finn jumped off the bed. "What are you doing? Don't touch Faye's things!"

Zoey ignored him and continued examining the piggy bank.

She looked it over but couldn't find a way to open it.

Finally, she asked Alexander, "Is this thing only for saving money? Can't it be opened?"

Alexander glanced at it. "Some can be opened from the bottom. Others you have to break."

Zoey understood.

Alexander noticed her intense focus on the piggy bank and, seeing Finn crying like a sad puppy, asked quietly, "You're not planning to break it, are you?"

"You're right. I'm taking it."

Alexander was puzzled. "Why?"

Zoey replied, "To X-ray it."

Alexander was speechless.

"Are you really going to take it back?" He asked.

Zoey gave him a look. "Do you think X-raying it is impractical? Should I just break it instead?"

Alexander was at a loss for words.

Worried that Zoey's actions would upset Finn, Alexander tried to calm him down. "If you want to break it, do it outside, not in front of Finn."

"Alright." Zoey grabbed the piggy bank and headed out. Finn immediately jumped off the bed.

Even though he had accepted favors from Zoey before, he couldn't let her take Faye's things.

Finn, shorter than Zoey, stood firm. "You can't take Faye's things. She loved that piggy bank the best!"

Zoey looked at him. "I just want to see how much money is inside."

Finn thought for a moment and then said a number he considered astronomical. "A hundred dollars! There's at least that much in there, so don't touch it. You can't afford to replace it!"

Zoey pretended to be shocked and turned to Alexander. "Alexander, go to the store and get five hundred dollars for him."

Alexander was confused. "What?"

Finn was also confused.

Didn't she understand? He meant she couldn't take Faye's piggy bank.

He was determined to protect it. "You can't take Faye's things. No amount of money will make me let you take it."

Zoey's patience was wearing thin. She was getting annoyed. "How about a trade? You give me the piggy bank, and I'll give you five hundred dollars. You're getting four hundred dollars more. It's just money inside, not Faye."

Finn kept crying, his snot almost touching her.

Zoey couldn't take it anymore and signaled Alexander.

Afraid she might actually hit Finn, Alexander quickly intervened. "Finn, I'll give you five hundred dollars and buy you some treats. How about that? Just stop crying, and I'll get you whatever you want."

Zoey watched Alexander's smooth handling of the situation and thought to herself, 'What a softie.'

She took the piggy bank and left Faye's house.

Outside, people were chatting. When they saw Zoey with the piggy bank, Robert recognized it immediately.

He asked, "Why did you bring that out?"

"Does anyone have something to break it with?" Zoey said.

Everyone was momentarily surprised.

Then Dennis spoke up. "I have a knife." He pulled a folding fruit knife from his pocket and handed it to Zoey.

Robert looked at Dennis. "Carrying a weapon? Looking like a thug is bad enough. As cops, we shouldn't carry knives."

Dennis, who felt insulted, defended himself. "Officer Davis, it's just for peeling fruit! Look how small it is."

Charles, seeing Robert tease Dennis, joined in. "Officer Davis is right, Dennis. I don't believe you either."

Dennis glared at Charles, silently cursing him as a suck-up.

Zoey took the knife and placed the piggy bank on the ground.

She was about to break it but then paused, thinking of something.

She looked around and saw nothing useful.

Zoey waved at Alexander, who had just finished calming Finn. "Alexander, take off your jacket and lend it to me."

Alexander was curious. "What do you need my jacket for?"

Zoey gave him a look and pointed at the piggy bank. "Isn't it obvious? To cushion it."

###chapter 125

Alexander glanced around at the people nearby and, with a sigh, reluctantly took off his expensive vest that he had only worn once, handing it to Zoey.

Zoey picked up the piggy bank and drew a two-inch radius circle on the bottom.

The others were puzzled. Why not just smash the piggy bank directly?

But they stayed silent, curious to see what Zoey would do.

Jordan asked, "Zoey, what are you up to?"

Zoey focused intently on the piggy bank in her hands. "I'm making an opening. If I just smash it, it'll be a mess and a pain to glue back together."

Jordan nodded, "Got it."

The others didn't think much of it, but Alexander was taken aback, thinking this wasn't like Zoey at all.

Normally, she would have just smashed it without a second thought. But now, she seemed to care about preserving the memories the Lynns had for the two girls.

Alexander stared at Zoey's back, lost in thought, wondering if this thoughtful person was really Zoey.

Had she changed? Or had she always been like this?

Alexander felt a strange sensation in his heart, but the more he watched, the more he noticed Zoey's careful work had turned his clean vest into a dirty mess.

She hadn't changed; she was still an annoying woman. He must be imagining things.

After Zoey finished, she used the tip of a knife to carefully cut along the circle she had drawn. A neat, round piece of ceramic fell out.

Zoey squinted and peered into the hole she had made. "Lay the vest flat."

Despite his irritation, Alexander followed her instructions and spread the vest out.

Zoey tipped the contents of the piggy bank onto the vest, and coins of various denominations spilled out.

As the last of the coins fell, Dennis spotted a piece of paper.

Robert was quicker and snatched it up. "This material looks like a page torn from a diary."

Jordan got excited. "Yeah, it must be."

Robert unfolded the paper, seeing it was a first-person account written by Sadie.

The diary entry was only a few hundred words long. Robert read it aloud to everyone in less than a minute.

After hearing it, everyone fell silent, feeling as if a dark cloud had settled over them, making it hard to breathe.

About ten minutes later, Cinda came out of the house and asked if they wanted to stay for a meal.

Cinda was so poor that if they all stayed, it would mean she wouldn't have enough to eat for a month.

Charles declined her offer. "No, thank you. We need to get going. Thanks anyway."

The others stood up and said their goodbyes.

They left Cinda's house and soon arrived at another home.

Dennis was starving and wanted to go in for a meal.

Robert, smelling the food wafting from the window, held Dennis back. "Let's wait. Let them finish eating first."

"Okay."

Zoey was also hungry. She pulled a cookie from her pocket and took a big bite.

The crisp sound of her biting into the cookie caught Alexander's attention.

Alexander looked curiously at the cookie in her hand. "Where'd you get that?"

Zoey had already eaten half of it. "I bought it myself."

"I know you bought it. I mean, do you always carry these around?"

"Yeah, otherwise what would I eat when I'm hungry?"

Alexander felt a bit foolish.

He remembered that even back in school, Zoey would always have something to snack on.

Why was she always so hungry? Who carried snacks around all the time? They were cops!

Zoey noticed Alexander's silence and asked, "Want some?"

Alexander replied, "No..."

"Too bad," Zoey said coldly.

Alexander was speechless.

He had said no, meaning he didn't want any.

Zoey's reaction was too quick.

They waited outside for over half an hour before seeing movement inside the house. Someone started working on the corn in the yard.

Jordan peeked inside and called out softly, "Rilla."

Rilla, hearing her name, looked up instinctively.

She must have just finished eating and was coming out to help with chores.

Seeing them, Rilla's expression remained calm. "What do you want?"

Her gaze swept over the group and finally landed on Zoey. "Did you find Haven? Where is Haven?"

Zoey replied, "If you cooperate with our questioning, I'll tell you."

Rilla glanced at the lit house behind her. "Now?"

"Yes."

Wanting to know about Haven, Rilla didn't hesitate. "Wait, I'll tell my parents."

"Okay, we'll wait."

Rilla went inside and came back out in less than two minutes, following them.

The group made their way back to the church.

Rilla waited in a room while Robert considered who should join him for the questioning.

Zoey volunteered, "I'll go with you."

Robert agreed, "Alright."

He led the way, and Zoey quickly followed, whispering something in his ear.

Robert's expression grew more serious as he listened. "Are you sure? Okay, let's try it."

Zoey was pleased when Robert nodded.

Alexander watched them, feeling a bit envious of Zoey, because Robert was really good to her.

In the interrogation room, Rilla sat casually playing with her phone, looking completely relaxed.

When they arrived, she stopped the music on her phone and placed it on the table. "Go ahead, I'm ready."

Robert glanced at Zoey, recalling what she had told him, and began to improvise. "Rilla, you don't need to be nervous. We've already found the culprit, and this case is almost closed. We're just here to fill in some missing details since you were the first to discover the scene."

Rilla was visibly surprised. "The case is almost closed?"

###chapter 126

"Yeah, we can close the case so fast thanks to the clues you gave us," Robert said, trying to sound casual.

Rilla didn't buy it, because she hadn't given any clues.

"What clues?" Rilla asked.

Robert hesitated, then, relying on his years of experience, smiled and said, "Can't really get into that."

Rilla nodded, pretending to understand. "If you have any other questions, go ahead."

Robert continued, "Just to confirm, when you found the three victims, they were lying on the ground with their pants halfway down, right?"

"Yes."

Robert mumbled something that sounded more like he was talking to himself than asking a question, "She was right."

Rilla immediately tensed up. "Who was right?"

"Ava, Evan, and Hugh's mom. You know her, right? She's from the same village."

"What did she say?" Rilla pressed.

Robert made a show of hesitating, glancing at Rilla's increasingly anxious expression. He sighed dramatically, "Since you're an important witness in this case, I guess it's okay to tell you. Our previous suspicions were correct. The three victims were indeed sexually assaulted."

Zoey noticed Rilla's pupils dilate slightly. "Who did it?"

"It was Hugh. We've already taken him into custody. The cops found his DNA on all three bodies."

When Rilla heard it was Hugh, she let out a cold laugh. "Scumbag!"

"But..." Zoey quickly shifted the topic, "Hugh claims the three of them seduced him. They invited him out at night because Janet didn't want to marry Evan and preferred to be his mistress. Faye and Sadie approached him about getting jobs, hoping he could help them."

"Unfortunately, Hugh is very loyal to his wife. No matter what the three of them said, he refused. But they kept pestering him, and when he tried to leave, they threatened to kill themselves if he did."

"Hugh thought they were bluffing and tried to leave, but they had ropes ready to hang themselves. Afraid they might actually do it, he felt he had no choice but to sleep with them. Afterward, he made it clear that it was pointless; he would never betray his wife. He left, but the next morning, feeling uneasy, he went back to check on them and found they had really hanged themselves. He cut them down, but fearing suspicion, he destroyed the evidence."

"Unfortunately, just as he was pulling their pants back up, he heard someone coming and had to flee, leaving the scene as you found it." Zoey finished and theatrically sighed, taking a sip of water from a bottle on the table.

Robert watched Rilla's expression the entire time Zoey spoke. He and Rilla remained silent, listening intently.

Robert thought Zoey's story was far-fetched, but to keep up appearances, he also took a sip of water.

Rilla seemed engrossed, visualizing the scenes Zoey described. After a moment, she responded, "What? You actually believe that?"

Zoey played dumb, "It makes sense, doesn't it? Why wouldn't we believe it?"

Rilla found it absurd. "How does that make any sense?"

"It's simple. Hugh's loaded, one of the top families in Willowbrook Village. It's only natural for girls to want to marry him, right?" Zoey crossed her arms and looked at Rilla. "So, what part doesn't make sense to you?"

Rilla was stunned, finding it hard to believe such words could come from a cop, especially a female one.

After thinking for a moment, Rilla said, "I can understand Janet not wanting to marry Evan, but why would she want to be Hugh's mistress?"

Zoey enjoyed debating logic and continued, "What's the problem? Is it because Hugh's been married three times? No matter how many times he's been married, at least he's a normal person, not an idiot. Men become more stable with experience. Janet can't escape marriage, so why not marry into a wealthy family and live comfortably?"

Rilla was speechless. "And what about Faye and Sadie? Even if they wanted jobs, they wouldn't sell their bodies to Hugh. I've interacted with them; they're very innocent, not the type to do something like that."

Zoey countered, "How do you know? You said you weren't close to them. How can you be sure what they would do? You can't judge a book by its cover. Besides, Willowbrook Village is different from other places. Women, there are either housekeepers or baby machines. Selling their bodies isn't unusual. I see no logical flaw."

"Sir!" Rilla suddenly raised her voice, "You can't say that! How can you, as cops, be so disrespectful?"

Zoey laughed nonchalantly, "I'm just stating the reality of your village. Isn't that how things are in Willowbrook Village? What's disrespectful about telling the truth? Who's really being disrespectful? Isn't it the people in Willowbrook Village? I'm just being honest. Isn't that right?"

Rilla was at a loss for words.

Unable to find a flaw in Zoey's argument, she reluctantly conceded, "Yes, I admit, there aren't many normal people in Willowbrook Village." She seemed ashamed of her village and took a deep breath before continuing, "But from my interactions with those three, I can tell they weren't like that. They were kind-hearted kids. They hadn't seen much of the world and were very naive. If you gave them a piece of candy, they'd give you everything they had, thinking you were the best person in the world. How could such innocent kids have such dirty thoughts? How could they let Hugh do that?"

"Why not?" Zoey replied calmly, as if discussing a movie. "I believe they were innocent at first. Everyone starts out good, but in Willowbrook Village, under the influence of the elders, they change. As they grow older, they become another Ava or any other elder in Willowbrook Village. In a few years, you'll be the same!"

###chapter 127

"I'll never be like that!" Rilla suddenly yelled, completely losing her cool.

Zoey's words had struck a nerve deep within her.

In all their interactions, this was the first time Zoey had seen Rilla so unhinged.

Zoey glanced at her, unfazed. "Based on what we know, everything Hugh said checks out. The three victims committed suicide out of guilt. In this village, a woman's worth is tied to her ability to have kids, right? They thought they couldn't get married anymore, so they saw suicide as the only way out."

"That's ridiculous!" Rilla shouted again, her eyes dark and furious. "Hugh is lying! It's a miracle he didn't harass those women. Them harassing him? Have you seen him? He'd be over the moon if anyone showed interest in him."

"Rilla, you should act like a college student. If you start making baseless accusations, you're no better than the other villagers in Willowbrook."

Rilla's eyes were filled with rage. Zoey's words only fueled her anger. "Your cops are useless! How could you come up with such a ridiculous conclusion? This case has nothing to do with me, but even as an outsider, I find it laughable. Can you honestly say that again and believe it makes sense? No one would accept this! I certainly don't."

Robert, sensing the rising tension, stepped in with a hint of frustration. "Rilla, whether you accept it or not doesn't matter. You didn't know them, and you're not their family. Your opinion doesn't count. The case has been ruled a suicide."

Rilla looked at Zoey and Robert in disbelief, her expression shifting from shock to resentment, and finally, she closed her eyes.

She laughed bitterly. "I thought you were serious about your work and would be good cops. Turns out, you're just hypocrites making up stories to get the job done!"

Zoey remained unfazed by her sarcasm. "Yeah, in your eyes, I'm not a good cop. So why should I tell you about Haven?"

Hearing Zoey use this to threaten her again, Rilla was speechless.

Seeing Rilla fall silent, Zoey smiled slightly. "So, don't insult the cops so casually."

Rilla was trembling with anger. To find out Haven's whereabouts, she had to swallow her pride and apologize. "I admit, I got a bit too emotional earlier. I shouldn't have called you hypocrites. I am sorry. I'm really hoping you can tell me where Haven is."

Seeing Rilla change her tune so quickly, Robert was speechless.

Zoey leaned in closer to observe Rilla, a faint smile playing on her lips. "I accept your apology. Now, I'll tell you where Haven is."

Rilla's eyes were fixed on Zoey, waiting for her to continue. "Haven couldn't have kids and felt like she let Hugh down, so she chose to end her life."

Rilla clearly didn't buy it. She glared at Zoey with pure hatred. "Are you even real cops? How can you twist the truth like this? It's impossible. Do you have any proof?"

Zoey pulled out an evidence bag, containing Haven's phone. "This is Haven's phone. You should recognize it. There's a video she recorded herself... a suicide note, explaining everything."

"A suicide note? A video?" Rilla was taken aback.

She stood up in a panic, reaching for the phone. "Let me see it."

Zoey quickly pulled the evidence bag away, not letting her grab it. "No, it's not convenient."

Rilla was about to faint from anger, but thinking of Haven, she had to hold back.

Recalling her memories with Haven, she still couldn't believe Haven would commit suicide.

Her lips trembled. "Haven isn't dead, right? You're lying to me, right? She wouldn't commit suicide. Even if she did, it must have been Hugh and his family who forced her. I told her that a woman's worth isn't just about getting married and having kids. I told her many times, and she agreed with me. We were going to see the ocean together. Why would she commit suicide? Even if she couldn't have kids, she doesn't need to die.."

She couldn't accept the news of Haven's death, teetering on the edge of a breakdown.

Zoey saw that she had lost the ability to think clearly, mumbling to herself.

Taking advantage of the moment, Zoey said, "Why would Hugh and his family force her to commit suicide? And why can't you accept this fact? Aren't you the one who likes to manipulate others into committing suicide?"

"That's different, they were..."

Rilla suddenly realized what Zoey had said. "What did you just say?"

"I said, aren't you the one who likes to encourage others to commit suicide? Did you tell your good friend to do it too? Even if you didn't mean to, maybe she took it that way." Zoey's smile was devoid of warmth. "And those strange ideas, reincarnation, heaven... they do sound appealing."

Rilla knew Zoey was trying to trap her.

But she couldn't stand Zoey using Haven as an example.

How could a casual word or story from her lead to their deaths?

"Shut up! I never said those things to Haven!" Rilla was agitated, defending her friendship with Haven. "Haven wasn't naive. She wouldn't die because of something I said. I just wanted her to live well. Those things I said were only to comfort those poor fools."

"Poor fools? Who do you mean?" For the first time, Zoey felt a bit of a connection with Rilla. "Let me guess, Janet, Faye, and Sadie?"

Rilla clammed up completely, refusing to speak further.

###chapter 128

Robert had been watching Rilla's face closely. Seeing her go quiet, he put on a concerned look and said, "Rilla, you don't even know what happens after we die, do you? Why do this? They're just kids. Instead of filling their heads with these lies and leading them to their deaths, wouldn't it be better to educate them, take them out of the village, and show them the world?"

"When they're dead, there's nothing left. What heaven are you talking about?"

"If they don't die, are they just destined to suffer for the rest of their lives?" Rilla replied.

Rilla had thought about it, but the people of Willowbrook Village were so stuck in their ways that they gave her no chance.

She couldn't take them out to see the world.

Seeing the two cops going back and forth, Rilla knew that everything she had done was now out in the open.

So she stopped pretending. "Did you find out about Janet being raped by Chad? Do you know about all the filthy things Hugh and his family have done? They can't escape. Living means endless suffering. Those so-called loving family members are the ones pushing them into the abyss. But they suffer because of their lack of education. Those aren't family members; they're demons. Yet, they can't let go of their feelings for these demonic relatives. Isn't that laughable?"

"They know their only contribution to the family is to become breeding machines, following in their mothers' footsteps, and they don't even see anything wrong with it! Women born in Willowbrook Village can't escape being treated as breeding machines. They live in pain, suppressing it until they get used to it. They even think all women in the world live like this and never question why." Rilla's voice grew more bitter and sharp, her emotions flaring as she condemned the injustice faced by women.

Zoey calmly squeezed the water bottle in her hand. "If you have such a strong sense of justice, you should help them escape, not lure them into suicide. So, stop pretending to be noble or a savior. You are not."

Rilla laughed at her words. "You think I didn't want them to escape? I tried myself. As soon as I got down the mountain, I ended up in Hugh's territory. His people lure me into the factory with promises of high wages, and if I refuse, they would drag me back in front of everyone. Because Hugh and I are from the same village, he gave me a chance to have my parents come and get me."

"And that 'rescue' comes at a price-money. If the person have the money, they can leave. If not, they must stay in the factory! The work is hard labor. What do you think a woman is expected to do there? You can guess."

Rilla's face twisted into a mocking smile. "By the time she earns enough to buy her freedom, at least ten years will have passed. By then, she has wasted the best years of her life. She has lost her youth and everything else, and she's of no use to them anymore."

Her words shattered Robert and Zoey's understanding once again.

Hugh was the village chief's son. How could he do such things?

The factory seemed legit on the surface, but it was involved in much more than just legal business.

Rilla saw the shock on the officers' faces and sneered. "The younger we are, the higher the price for our freedom. My parents spent thirty grand to get me out, nearly draining all their savings! If I weren't their only child, they wouldn't have spent that money. If I were gone, there'd be no one to take care of them in their old age. Even when I was in college, they were still trying for a son. My mom did get pregnant, but her body was too old, and she lost the baby."

She continued, "If that baby had been a girl, I might have had a chance, remaining their only hope. If it had been a boy, I'd probably still be working in Hugh's factory, earning my freedom. Officers, have you ever wondered why Hugh dares to run such a big operation, even bigger than you can imagine?"

"Because the people here are backward, and outsiders are almost nonexistent. No one dares to risk opposing the village chief. Most importantly, he has money. In a poor place, he can do whatever you want here with money."

"He's so rich, yet he stays in this small place. Do you know why? Because no one can control him! Here, he's practically a god."

Robert and Zoey hadn't expected that the discovery of three female bodies would uncover the last veil hiding Willowbrook Village's shame.

No wonder no one dared to talk about the village chief's family since they arrived. Everyone was afraid of offending them.

In their minds, the cops weren't as scary as the village chief's family.

Robert took a deep breath, piecing together everything they had discovered in Willowbrook Village. He was already planning how to report this to his superiors.

He was determined to eradicate this cancerous tumor and let the villagers live normal lives.

Zoey glanced at Rilla. "I get your sense of justice, but I need to correct one thing. Your mom's miscarriage wasn't because of her age; it was because of the poor quality of your father's sperm."

"Here's a little-known fact: why do we hear that older mothers are more likely to miscarry, have premature births, or have babies with birth defects? It's because many women choose partners older than themselves, so the husbands of older mothers are often even older."

"In fact, 97% of genetic mutations are due to the father's age, not the mother's. Think about it. A woman produces only about 400 eggs in her lifetime, while a man releases 20 million sperm in a single ejaculation. Only one makes it to the end, a survival rate of one in 20 million. How fragile is that?"

"In contrast, a woman's eggs are formed when she's a 6-8 week old embryo. That's true genetic stability. So, if your parents really want a healthy son with normal intelligence, your mom should find a younger guy."

###chapter 129

Rilla was at her wit's end.

She couldn't take it anymore. Could they just stop talking?

Was this really the main issue?

Wasn't the main issue at Hugh's factory?

After Zoey finished explaining the technical details to Rilla, she smoothly shifted the topic back. "Alright, back to the point. You're a college student, don't you know you should go to the cops when something happens?"

"Go to the cops? If it were that simple, don't you think I would have done that a long time ago? Have you ever looked into Hugh's factory? Do you know how many people he has working for him? And they're so secretive, you wouldn't find anything even if you tried. You wouldn't be able to take them all down at once. Do you know what would happen to me and my family if you failed? Besides, I don't really trust your so-called cops. Every cop who comes here just goes through the motions. They always visit Hugh's house first, listen to the village chief, and never consider our voices. Even if they did, no one wants to make enemies or get involved in our business."

Rilla thought about their attitude towards her earlier, and their indifference to Janet, Faye, and Sadie's deaths. It made her heart ache. "Honestly, I don't trust you guys at all right now."

Zoey chuckled lightly, "Is that so? We don't need you to trust us."

Rilla thought that Zoey was really annoying.

Robert, after processing all this information, felt sympathy for Rilla's situation.

Sympathy aside, Rilla still had to face the consequences of inciting others to commit suicide.

Zoey stopped discussing whether Rilla trusted the police and knocked on the table. "Let's talk about you. How did you manipulate them?"

Rilla huffed and turned her head away. "I don't know!"

Seeing the tension between the two women, Robert stepped in to mediate. "Rilla, you need to watch your attitude. You're different from the other villagers in Willowbrook. You're a college graduate. Cooperating with the justice system is a civic duty. Do I need to remind you again? No, right? You can't escape the charge of inciting suicide, but do you really want Hugh to continue getting away with everything? If you cooperate with us, I promise you, Hugh will be punished!"

Rilla listened to his words, as if debating with another voice in her head.

One voice said that she needed to save them.

Another voice said that Hugh must go to jail.

She resigned herself, closed her eyes for a few seconds, then slowly opened them again. "How will you punish him?"

Robert answered seriously, "We'll contact the relevant local authorities to intervene and rectify the situation in your village. First, we'll thoroughly investigate Hugh's entire operation. We'll also address community issues, like ensuring all children receive an education, providing subsidies to impoverished families, and helping more young adults find jobs outside the village."

These were all things Rilla had dreamed of changing.

She was somewhat convinced and slowly nodded.

Zoey, thinking this wasn't enough, added, "I'll also get the media involved, and expose Willowbrook Village's scandals online. It'll definitely cause a stir, and the whole state of Veridian will wake up to it!"

Rilla was speechless.

Even though she found Zoey annoying, she couldn't help but feel a bit satisfied with what she said.

"Actually, I have another idea," Zoey continued. "I could contact the development bureau and have Willowbrook Village designated as the most backward village in the country. We could turn it into a tourist spot for city folks to visit. If done right, it might even create a new industry and lead to prosperity."

Rilla felt more speechless.

Robert almost laughed at Zoey's suggestion but kept a serious expression as he looked at Rilla, waiting for her response. "So, Rilla, do you still not trust us?"

Rilla wasn't sure if they could keep their promises.

They had evidence against her. If they couldn't or didn't intend to follow through, they wouldn't have said all this.

As Rilla struggled to find the right words, Zoey interjected, "If you cooperate, I'll also tell you the real cause of Haven's death."

Rilla snapped to attention at the mention of Haven. "So you were lying earlier? What else are you hiding from me?"

Zoey said, "Well, at least I can guarantee that what I'm saying now is the truth."

Despite her doubts, Rilla agreed.

For the sake of justice, for the sake of waking up everyone in Willowbrook Village.

She lowered her head and began to speak, "It's a long story. Among Janet, Faye, and Sadie, I knew Janet the longest. I was twenty-three, and she was only sixteen. I had just graduated from college and wanted to work outside. The interviews went well, but when I started working, I found out my salary was $1,500 less than my colleagues who joined at the same time."

"HR told us on the first day that discussing salaries was forbidden. I overheard it by chance and had no proof, so I didn't dare confront my superiors. After a few days, I met someone who told me to leave the company quickly. She said they made female employees do things outside of work, like drinking with clients or even sleeping with them."

"A girl who was in a higher position than me got pregnant and was forced to resign. I thought these things were far from me, a newcomer, but I was wrong. After she left, they assigned the drinking duties to me. I refused, and they started to bully me at work. It wasn't long before the holidays, so I quit and went home, planning to find another job after the new year."

"But I was wrong. I thought I'd be safe at home, but the first day I got back, my parents pressured me to stay in Willowbrook Village. They threatened me, saying they had been good to me by letting me go to college, and I couldn't leave them. I had to stay and take care of them, and they wanted me to marry someone from the village so I could be close by."

"Of course, I didn't want to stay. I went to college to escape Willowbrook Village... But in this village, women, including my mother, have no status. To the men here, women are like livestock, only good for having children. If there's a second purpose, it's to serve them day and night!"

###chapter 130

"Every time my parents bring this up, we end up having a huge fight!" As Rilla spoke, the light in her eyes gradually dimmed, filled with disappointment. "Maybe I really can't escape Willowbrook Village. Back then, the economy was rough, and even graduates from top universities struggled to find jobs. I had no choice. I ended up getting a basic teaching certificate and, following my parents' wishes, became an elementary school teacher in the town at the foot of the mountain."

"It was during this time that I met Janet. We slowly became friends. I learned about her situation-no matter what she did, she was always scolded. Everything she did was wrong, and she had to do all the housework while her brother did nothing."

"Every time Janet vented her frustrations to me, she cried so hard. I kept advising her to leave, to go to another city, even if it meant working as a waitress. At least she'd be free. Janet was already sixteen, but probably due to long-term malnutrition, she didn't get her period until she was eighteen. Her mom thought she couldn't have children and even cursed her, saying if she couldn't bear children, she might as well be dead to save the family some food."

Zoey listened, already used to what happened in Willowbrook Village.

Every parent imposed their misfortunes on their children, hoping they'd be even more unfortunate.

Rilla continued, "She's just a girl, and girls naturally depend on their parents and are timid. She hadn't seen much of the world. The thing she said to me the most was that she wished her mother would love her. Just one compliment from her mom, and she'd work like crazy in the fields. I realized how deeply her parents had influenced her mind. It took a long to wake her up a bit. She finally started thinking about leaving."

"I was also working hard to leave. Even though I was teaching elementary school, I kept sending out resumes every day. When I got a job offer in the city, I was ecstatic. But when I went home to pack, my parents refused to let me go. They even arranged a marriage for me! The guy was over ten years older than me, divorced with a kid. I was on the verge of breaking down. No matter what I said, they wouldn't listen. I had no choice but to leave without my luggage, sneaking out when they weren't paying attention."

"I almost made it. But at the train station, I ran into someone from our village. He must have noticed how anxious I was and guessed I was running away. He kept talking to me, trying to take me to work at Hugh's factory. I refused, saying I already had a job, but he wouldn't listen. He looked at me strangely, and then another man appeared out of nowhere and dragged me away right in front of everyone at the train station!"

"Do you know how desperate I felt? I screamed for help, but it was useless! No one helped me; they just watched like it was a show!"

"I still remember the looks on their faces!" Rilla's jaw was clenched so tightly it seemed like her teeth might shatter.

She trembled all over. "Looking back, it seemed like everyone at the station was men. It's terrifying to think about. My parents eventually bought me back because they were afraid no one would take care of them in their old age. They didn't dare mention marriage again, but they took my paycheck every month."

"Even if they didn't watch me, I wouldn't dare leave. It's too scary. We can't escape. I even advised Janet not to leave because she had a brother. If she left, no one would buy her back."

"Through Janet, I met Faye and Sadie. The people in the village loved gossiping, only talking about village matters. But Faye and Sadie were different. They often came to chat with me, listening to stories about life outside Willowbrook Village."

"I had gotten used to the ignorance of the people here. At first, I got angry, but eventually, I became numb because I knew I couldn't change anything. Maybe it was because I had been in the village too long. Even when people insulted me, I didn't bother to fight back."

"This numb life continued until Janet came to me in tears, saying she was getting married. I was shocked and asked why so suddenly. She told me everything. I had suffered at Hugh's factory and knew his family wasn't good. Janet didn't want to marry, but her parents had decided. She spent every day crying at my place."

"Faye and Sadie started coming over more often. Maybe they saw Janet crying all the time and were affected. Faye told me about being raped multiple times by Chad. I was horrified. Chad was a beast, threatening Faye that if she didn't marry him, he'd find a way to rape Sadie too. He even threatened to tell everyone about their relationship, forcing their parents to make them both marry him!"

"I felt so powerless, so much that the absurdity of Willowbrook Village made me laugh. Women here have no dignity. We can't escape, and no one listens to us. What kind of place is this?"

"From the bottom of my heart, I believe this place shouldn't be called Willowbrook Village. It should be called Hell!" Rilla's voice was filled with despair and helplessness, her remaining anger crushed by reality; her tears streamed down her face.

"For a while, I listened to them talk about the injustices they faced every day. I wanted to help them, but I knew I couldn't even help myself. How could I help others? I told them I hoped they could all be okay, but deep down, I knew it was impossible. The only fate for women here is to serve men and bear their children." The more she spoke, the harder she cried, making some words hard to understand. Zoey had to guess their meaning.

Zoey added, "That's really sad. So, what happened next?"

Rilla was speechless.

She had wanted to pour out her tragic story, but Zoey's indifference interrupted her.

The atmosphere was ruined, and she couldn't continue. Her tears subsided a bit.

Rilla added, "In the following days, every time I closed my eyes, I saw Janet, Faye, and Sadie crying in front of me. It made me feel so depressed. I thought maybe watching a movie would help."

###chapter 131

"I watched this old black-and-white movie from the last century. It was about these young girls who, trying to escape the miserable lives waiting for them after marriage, found this beautiful legend. It said that after death, they could go to a place where there was no forced matchmaking, and no pressure to have kids. Everyone could get an education and be respected. In the end, they all died on the same day, hoping to reach that beautiful place together and leave this world behind."

"Honestly, I think it's just a movie. Whether in the past or now, how could such a wonderful place exist? But when I saw them crying about how unfair life was, I couldn't help but tell them about the movie. I even told them that a lot of what I said before was true."

"I didn't expect my words to actually stop their crying. They kept asking me if it was true. Seeing the hope in their eyes, I didn't know what to say. Should I tell them it was fake and let them keep living without hope? Or should I watch them fall into despair, becoming the next Ava or other women in the village? Those poor, clueless souls?"

Robert took a deep breath and couldn't help but jump in, "But if they stay alive, there's a chance they could change their lives in the future. If they die, then it's all over."

"All over?" Rilla didn't see it that way. "Sir, let me ask you, what do you think they lose after they die?"

"Good food? Or the feeling of love, like friendship? Family?" Robert instinctively placed family last.

Rilla laughed again. "They can't even leave the village. What do you think they can eat? You've seen the village store, right? What's in there? And feeling love? If they really had parents who loved them dearly, I wouldn't be here. Friendship, sure, they agreed to die together. Maybe they really can go to that beautiful land."

"Death is indeed a form of release, but people need to be alive to have hope."

"Hope? Who gives hope? An uncertain future?" Rilla said. "Janet's mother didn't shed a single tear after Janet's suicide, right? She even thought Janet's death meant she wouldn't get any money. If there was real hope, they wouldn't be so desperate. It's the elusive hope that tortures people the most."

Robert found himself at a loss for words.

Rilla's twisted logic, he found himself somewhat agreeing with it internally.

But he was a cop; he couldn't agree with her perspective.

He glanced at Zoey beside him. Zoey seemed deep in thought, not noticing Robert's expression.

The atmosphere grew tense.

Seeing that neither of them refuted her, Rilla sneered and continued, "I told them that fate might be different for everyone, but there's one fair thing: whether rich or poor, everyone can't avoid death. Only death is fair."

"Janet asked me if the world after death was a place where you could go wherever you wanted. I gave her an affirmative."

"She said she just wanted to go to a place with girls her age. I told her there is such a place. As long as she wants to go, she can go. People are just bodies carrying souls. When the body is gone, the soul only needs a thought to go anywhere. Not even a bus fare is needed."

"After hearing me, they looked at each other and wanted to die quickly, as if only by dying could they live the life they wanted. I told them that once they died, they would never see their living relatives again. Did they still want to die? I told them to go home and ask if their families were willing to let them go."

"They really went back and asked. Janet told me her mom said she hadn't gotten anything good from her. Her brother hadn't married yet, and even if Janet died, she would still be a slave to their family. She even cursed Janet with vicious words, saying she would be a wandering ghost forever, never to be reborn."

"And Cinda? After Faye told Cinda about Chad, Cinda still wanted her to marry Chad. All her attention was on Finn, completely ignoring Faye. Faye told me she felt Cinda might really marry her and Sadie off to Chad."

"From then on, they were disheartened with their families and wanted to leave together. I even asked Faye, 'Sadie is so young, why not wait a couple of years?' Faye told me Chad wouldn't give them the chance to wait. She wanted to die with Sadie, or else she didn't know how Chad would treat her after she died. She would grow up hating me for not taking her with me."

"So, I set a date for them. I really tried to persuade them to think it over or wait. But they seemed determined, not caring about anything anymore. They even tried to persuade me to go with them. I didn't have the courage and didn't think they would really have the courage to commit suicide. I told them to dress nicely and go with the sunrise. It would be a good omen."

"They told me they didn't like the daytime because daylight meant they had to work. So they set the time for midnight, tidied their rooms, put on what they thought were their prettiest clothes, and said goodbye to their families in their hearts."

"But I really didn't expect them to actually commit suicide! I didn't expect the people of Willowbrook Village to be so perverse, not even sparing the dead! They were already corpses, yet they still had to be violated. They all deserve to die, to go to hell! Especially Hugh, he's a scumbag. Don't believe a word he says. He's not to be trusted!"

Seeing Rilla getting agitated again, Robert took a deep breath, wanting to tell her that Hugh really had nothing to do with this.

Zoey, however, spoke up directly, "This really has nothing to do with Hugh. The mastermind is Olivia. Surprised? Olivia did all this to get Hugh imprisoned. And to make you even angrier, Olivia was driven to this by Hugh and his family."

Rilla was speechless.

###chapter 132

Rilla's eyes drilled into Zoey. "How many lies have you told me?"

Zoey smirked. "That's all there is."

"It doesn't matter how much. I've told you everything you wanted to know. I admit, I'm partly to blame for Janet, Faye, and Sadie's suicides. Do what you want with me. I just need to know about Haven!"

Zoey blinked, still playing coy. "I think you should have figured it out by now."

Rilla felt a surge of anger, wanting to strangle Zoey. "I can't guess!"

"Come on, you should be able to. Janet and Olivia told you about Hugh's family, didn't they?" Zoey's voice was icy. "You just don't want to imagine those horrific experiences happening to Haven."

"Sir, just tell me. Honesty is important, especially for a cop." Rilla invoked the cop and honesty, leaving Zoey no choice but to speak. "Alright, I'll tell you. It's just like Olivia said."

"Can I see the video myself?" Rilla interrupted. She needed to see Haven's video with her own eyes to be at peace. She didn't trust anyone else's words.

Zoey firmly refused. "Our cops' intelligence can't be shown to just anyone. Unless you're Haven's family, you have no right. You have no choice but to listen to me or guess yourself. Your call."

"Fine, tell me. But please, no more lies. Thank you." Rilla's sincere gaze hoped to move Zoey.

Robert, standing nearby, couldn't understand Rilla and Haven's friendship. Why did she need to know? Even if she learned the truth, what could it change?

Zoey sighed. "No lies. Haven's fate was worse than Olivia's. Hugh and his family forced her to sleep with Evan to have a child. Afraid the baby might be mentally challenged, they made her sleep with Hugh's father. She couldn't bear the humiliation and chose to end her life. In her video, she mentioned you often. That's why we came to you. She said she regretted not escaping to the ocean with you, that she was sorry, and hoped you would live well."

Rilla listened to Haven's words, tears streaming down her face. The ocean was indeed their shared dream. She knew this time, Zoey wasn't lying. But she had no future left.

For someone who had driven others to suicide, Haven's fate was unbearable. Maybe her intentions were good at first, hoping these kids could have a better future, stopping them from falling into the abyss. She didn't want them to become another Ava or any woman from Willowbrook Village. But her best friend, driven to extreme pain, had taken her own life.

Rilla wept, thinking of all her memories with Haven. She wiped her tears and looked up at Zoey. "Aside from being a cop, do you think what I did was right or wrong?"

Zoey found Rilla's question absurd. "If you think you did nothing wrong, why didn't you die with them? Your fate would have been the same."

"I will, if my parents ever force me to marry someone like Chad or Hugh, I'll end my life too. Even if I know there's no perfect place, it's better than here. I believe people have souls, and death is an escape. Now that they're gone, I have no one to talk to. Sometimes I wish I were dead."

Zoey replied, "In prison, you can make friends and keep talking."

Rilla knew Zoey hated her. How could a cop like someone who incited others to suicide? She didn't care and laughed. "I understand your disdain. I was wrong. They had the courage to die. I should have teamed up with them to kill Hugh and Chad. A few years in prison, and we'd be free, never returning to this hellhole. But why did I hesitate? I don't know. I was the one hurt the most."

"Officer Brown, don't you think we're pathetic? Too scared to kill others, we only hurt ourselves, seeking freedom through self-harm."

Zoey said, "Others might be like that, but you're different. You incited them to suicide."

"Your words are too absolute. If you were me, what would you do? Watch them walk into the abyss?"

It was hard to empathize without experiencing it. If Zoey were in Rilla's shoes, she thought she'd be even more ruthless. She'd form a revenge squad, kill Hugh, then Chad. And Ava too. They all deserved to die. Evil people should be freed from their misery sooner.

"Rilla, in prison, you can read a book called 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being.' As you can see, I'm not highly educated, but I got this from the book: The heaviest of burdens is therefore simultaneously an image of life's most intense fulfillment."

Everyone in the world wasn't always doing meaningful things. The time wasted and moments spent with someone could become meaningful later. So, the concept of meaning was too broad. At least, she still couldn't fully grasp it.

Zoey remembered someone named Vernon from high school. When tutoring him, he pulled out a book from a pile of comics, saying he wanted to be a shining star in human history. She thought it was foolish, not on her level. But for the tutoring fee, she clapped and supported his dream. Was she any better than him? They were all just losers.

The victims' experiences were tragic, and heartbreaking. But life was precious. They shouldn't give up climbing the mountain of life because of a small setback.

###chapter 133

A long time ago, there was a sensational news story about a young woman who had just graduated from college and was kidnapped by human traffickers to a small village, similar to Willowbrook Village.

She was forced to become a baby-making machine, suffering even more than the three victims we know about.

Her parents weren't around, and the man she was forced to marry was chosen at random.

To break her spirit and prevent her from escaping, they beat her constantly until she got pregnant, and then the beatings stopped.

But she didn't give up on her life. She chose to face her situation with strength.

Using her power as a woman, as a mother, she became a respected figure in that village.

She led the entire village to prosperity and eventually found her biological parents.

Her parents thought she would leave, but she chose to stay in the village where she was taken. She said that only by staying and changing their mindset could she help reduce the number of women and children being trafficked in the world.

Her actions truly showcased the power of women.

As long as a person didn't bow to fate, they could overcome it, living the life they wanted.

Rilla had no right to decide others' life and death, yet she handed them the knife to stab themselves.

As Robert handcuffed Rilla, she was still worried about Hugh. "You'll investigate Hugh's factory, right?"

"We promised you, and we'll get it done. Not just for you, but for all citizens. We must eliminate all threats to public health. That's our duty as Veridian cops!" Robert's solemn response reassured Rilla.

With Rilla's case wrapped up, Zoey stretched as she walked out of the interrogation room.

Alexander was sitting outside, fiddling with a piggy bank.

Seeing her, he shook the piggy bank in the air: "All done. Does it look like new?"

"Good job."

Alexander was a bit speechless. Was she praising him like a child?

She always liked to act like the leader in front of him, and Alexander was used to it. He didn't argue with her.

He turned and asked, "How's Rilla's situation?"

"She confessed, but it led to other issues, which might be more troublesome than the case itself." Zoey gave Alexander a look, and they walked out of the church together.

They talked about the case as they walked, yawning in the cold night air.

Before they knew it, they were at Faye's doorstep.

Zoey handed the piggy bank to Alexander. "You go."

"You're not coming?"

"I hate crybabies, especially boys."

Alexander was speechless, but he could understand.

He took the piggy bank and walked inside.

Just as he stepped in, Zoey called him back. "Take this too."

She handed him the torn page from the diary.

With the case solved, the evidence was no longer needed. Cinda could place it on their graves.

Alexander took it all inside as Zoey instructed.

He was back out in less than a minute. "The case is closed. We can head back to Emerald City."

Zoey frowned deeply and nodded.

Then her stomach growled. She was hungry.

Alexander said, "I think there's a cup of noodles in Dennis's car."

"Perfect, go get it."

"Got it."

As the night deepened, a car with out-of-state plates slowly drove out of Willowbrook Village.

The case of the three female corpses was solved.

The ugliness of Willowbrook Village was finally exposed.

Robert stayed behind for a week to handle Hugh's factory before returning to Emerald City.

After Hugh was punished, the local media quickly reported it, and it became the hottest news for several days.

Netizens, as Zoey predicted, condemned Willowbrook Village.

They couldn't believe such a backward place still existed.

But since the police released the report, it confirmed the case's authenticity. Various online influencers shared their thoughts, highlighting the horrors of Willowbrook Village.

Some influencers even planned to rent houses in Willowbrook Village to livestream and show it from a first-person perspective.

The explosive public outcry drew the attention and intervention of relevant authorities, promising a different future for the village.

Zoey watched the news about Willowbrook Village and thought about her conversation with Rilla.

She had only guessed, but it all came true. Did this consider that she hadn't lied to Rilla?

Robert hadn't even reached home yet, and insisted on enrolling Zoey in a driving school, with Robert footing the bill and asking Tenley to say it was reimbursed by his work.

Zoey was smart and quickly passed the written test.

She spent weekends completing the vision test.

The day Robert returned, Zoey had just gotten home.

They ran into each other, and Zoey greeted him first, "Officer Davis, you're back."

Seeing Zoey, Robert's tired face brightened. "How's the police station? Are you settling in?"

"It's been quiet, just handling some small cases."

"That's good. How's the driving going?"

"Pretty well."

"Good, try to get your license soon."

"Yes, Officer Davis, I'll work hard." Zoey followed Robert into the house and headed straight to the bathroom for a shower.

Robert had arranged for an old friend to be her instructor, hoping he could accommodate Zoey's schedule despite his busy work at the police station.

Finally, back from Willowbrook Village, he called to thank his friend. "Kai, thanks for helping Zoey. Let's grab a meal sometime."

Kai laughed.

Robert added, "Zoey's great, right? Really smart. We didn't need more people, but she has a real talent for being a detective."

Kai laughed again.

"Can we talk? Why do you keep laughing?"

Kai couldn't take it anymore and snapped at Robert, his voice booming. "Thanks a lot, Robert! Where did you find this student? She's incredible! I've never seen someone who couldn't drive three feet in half a day, but she wants to hit the road after one lesson! Ridiculous! Who drives 60 mph on their first lesson? I was scared to the extreme!"

"Not just me, the other students in the car were terrified! They wouldn't get back in! How does she dare? How? I was so scared. I didn't dare scold her, afraid she'd take me straight to heaven!"

Robert was speechless.

###chapter 134

He chuckled weakly, "Haha, my student's got some serious skills, huh?"

Kai, still catching his breath, replied, "Yeah! She's only been at it for a bit and she's already this good. Too bad she doesn't fly fighter jets!"

Robert chimed in, "Fighter jets? No way! Our detective squad needs talent like this."

Kai was speechless.

It was clear how much Zoey had shocked Kai.

Feeling a bit awkward, Robert remembered Zoey's various antics at the police station and felt somewhat apologetic. "Kai, once she gets her driver's license, I'll treat you to three meals. How about that?"

Kai angrily hung up without giving him a single reply.

After Robert hung up, Tenley noticed his goofy smile. "What happened? Why are you so happy?"

Robert said, "Zoey and Kelvin are like two extremes. I still remember when Kelvin went to get his driver's license, Kai was just as angry, saying the kid was too cautious, taking forever to press the gas pedal and spending tens of seconds checking the road conditions."

Talking about Kelvin, they both suddenly remembered they had a son.

Tenley added, "By the way, Kelvin said he's free these days and might come back next week."

"Really? Let me know when he's coming back. I'll take a few days off to spend time with him, see if he's been keeping fit while living away." Robert's face couldn't hide his pride when he mentioned Kelvin.

Tenley smiled, "You don't scare him away."

"Scare him? I'm just concerned about him. You know, as a doctor, he spends most of his time sitting. If I don't teach him well, he might catch something from the hospital. How can he treat others if he doesn't stay healthy?"

"You're right."

Robert had been so exhausted from handling Hugh's case that he fell asleep as soon as he lay down.

They completely forgot that Kelvin's room had been rented out.

There was no place for Kelvin in the house.

A week later, Kelvin returned.

He took the earliest train, thinking that when he got home, Tenley would have a big meal waiting for him, just like old times.

He imagined enjoying a happy time with his parents, then taking a lazy nap, and later chatting and watching TV with them.

It was a beautiful thought, but when he opened the door, there wasn't a person in sight, let alone a big meal.

"Dad, Mom, I'm home!"

There was no one answered.

Kelvin thought they might be out grocery shopping, so he changed into his slippers and headed straight to his room to find his pajamas.

He didn't like wearing formal clothes at home; pajamas were the most comfortable.

But when he opened the bedroom door, neatly placed at the entrance was a pink pajama set.

Turning his head, he saw a girl lying on his bed who was reading a book.

"Sorry, I must have entered the wrong room." Kelvin lowered his head and quickly backed out.

Facing the unfamiliar Zoey, he completely forgot this was his room.

It wasn't until he stepped out that he realized that was his room.

Why was there a woman living in his room?

Zoey, seeing Kelvin's flustered departure, thought he was foolish.

Robert and Tenley hadn't mentioned Kelvin's return. Maybe he wanted to surprise his parents?

Zoey got up from the bed and called out his name, "Kelvin?"

Kelvin instinctively responded, his handsome face full of confusion, "You... know me?"

"I'm Zoey Brown, your dad's subordinate. I'm staying here for a while." With Zoey's explanation, Kelvin understood.

He still confirmed, "You're staying in my room?"

"Yeah, five hundred bucks a month, including three meals and rides to work."

Kelvin was speechless. In the pricey Emerald City, his parents had rented out his room for such a low price. Did they think so little of him?

Before Kelvin could say anything, Zoey took on a host-like demeanor, "I've already paid several months' rent, so I have the right to use this room. Understand?"

"Got it."

"Good." No wonder he was Robert's son, so easy to understand.

She didn't need to explain further.

Zoey yawned and stretched, planning to close the door and continue her nap. She needed to recharge during her rare time off.

As she was about to close the door, Kelvin called out, "Do you know where my parents went?"

"They went to run a marathon. They should be back in the afternoon." Zoey replied.

"Okay, thanks." Kelvin placed his suitcase next to the sofa. Even though it was his home, with Zoey there, his actions felt restricted and a bit awkward.

His peripheral vision kept catching glimpses of Zoey because the space was so small, it was hard not to see her.

Strangely, seeing Zoey made him inexplicably nervous.

Zoey noticed his fatigue and, trying to appear more approachable, asked, "Have you had breakfast?"

"No."

"Go eat. There's food in the kitchen. Just heat it up."

Kelvin felt speechless. It seemed like this had become her home, and he was the guest.

"Thanks." Kelvin felt a bit conflicted but accepted the reality.

Zoey had the right to use his room.

He asked, "Ms. Brown, do you know where my pajamas are? I'd like to take a shower. I got all sweaty from the trip."

"Check your wardrobe. I haven't touched it. I don't have many clothes."

"Okay." Kelvin stood up and headed to the room to check the wardrobe.

Just as he reached the door, he remembered what Zoey had said.

He no longer had the right to the room. If he just walked in, would Zoey think he had no manners?

Even though it was his room, he had to meekly look at Zoey, "Could you help me get them? Sorry for the trouble."

"No problem." She went in and rummaged through the wardrobe.

The pajamas were right on top, in plain sight. She found them and handed them to him, "Is this it?"

"Yeah, that's it." Kelvin thanked her and turned to leave.

But Zoey called out again, "I think you might need this too."

Kelvin saw it was his underwear in her hand, feeling extremely embarrassed.

She really didn't see him as a man at all.
