###Chapter 1


CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW


Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.


I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that stupid handmade card on his desk. The one I'd spent hours making, like a fool who still believed in fairy tales.


The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, wvriting words I thought mattered.


My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.


"Sign here. And here." Stefan's voice was distant,businesslike. He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. "The highlighted sections need initials."



My hands wouldn't stop shaking. "You're doing this today? On our anniversary?"


"Camille." He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before."There's no point dragging this out."


The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. "Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear," she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.


"Is there someone else?"



The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas."Yes."


One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.


"How long?"


"Two months." He wouldn't meet my eyes. "She came back to town and..."


"Two months," I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped kissing me goodbye in the mornings. "Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?"


" didn't want to hurt you."


A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. "That's thoughtful of you."


My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout l'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.


"Let me get that..." Stefan reached for the paper towels.


"Don't." My voice cracked. "Just... don't pretend to care now."



I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.


The world stopped.


I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.



"Rose?" My sister's name tasted like poison. "Your first love was Rose?"



Stefan's silence said everything.


Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving toasts at our engagement party. Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.


My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.


"She never left town, did she?" The pieces were falling into place. "She's been here the whole time,waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at stupid, naive Camille."


"It wasn't like that." Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture | used to find endearing. "We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to..."


"If you say 'meant to be' I swear l'll throw this mug at your head." My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. "How long were you together before?Before mne?"


He shifted uncomfortably. "Four years. Until she got the job offer in London."


Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan.

The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.


"She set this up," I whispered. "All of it. And I fell for every piece."


"Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you."


"Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend l was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. "She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, rigt?"


Blood dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.


"Don't touch me." I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. "Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?"


"She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better..."
"Better?" | laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. "Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people."


I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.


"Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly."


I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady.Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd Won.



"I'm done talking." I gathered my purse,the signed papers, Rose's photo. "Done pretending.Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains."


"Where are you going?"


"Away from you. Away from her.Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard."



My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue,coming to play her part.


I declined the call and walked to the door. Behind me,Stefan called out, "You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts..."


"You can have it all." I turned to face him one last time. "The house, the cars, the life you built on lies.I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you."


"Camille,please...


"Goodbye, Stefan." I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. "Give Rose my love.Tell her thank you, actually."


"For what?"



"For finally showing me the truth. About her, about you,about who l need to become."


I walked out of that house, out of that life,leaving bloody fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me.
Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't.Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty.


My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother.Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all.


Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.


In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, blood stained my dress, my hair had come loose from its perfect twist.



I looked nothing like the polished, proper wife Stefan Rodriguez had married.
###Chapter 2



Camille's point of view


The house was quiet, too quiet. I slipped in through the side door, locking it softly behind me. The air smelled like lemon polish and roses, just like it always did. It felt strange to be back, like stepping into someone else's life.



The kitchen was dark except for the faintglow of the fridge light. I crept up the stairs, careful to skip the third step that creaked. Every sound I made felt loud,like the house itself was listening.


When I reached my bedroom door, I stopped. It was open a crack, just like I'd left it all those years ago.Taking a deep breath, I stepped inside and shut the door.



My childhood bedroom hadn't changed in three years.Same pale pink walls, same white furniture,same collection of second-place trophies. Rose's first-place ones used to shine in the room next door.


I stared at my reflection in the vanity mirror, the same one where I'd practiced my wedding makeup three years ago, Rose standing behind me with that perfect smile. Now my mascara was smeared, hair wild,designer dress wrinkled. Mom would have a fit if she saw me like this.



The clock on my nightstand read 10:47 PM. I'd been sitting here for hours, packing what little of my old life I wanted to keep. Amazing how seventeen years in this house fit into one duffel bag.


My phone buzzed again, the twentieth time in an hour. This time it was Mom.



"Camille, this is ridiculous. Come home so we can discuss this like adults. Rose is worried sick..."


I hung up. Of course Rose was worried. Her carefully laid plans were unraveling.
The front door clicked open downstairs. I froze,listening to familiar footsteps on hardwood. The slight tap of heels, the whisper of expensive fabric.


"Camille?" Mom's voice floated up the stairs."Darling, I know you're here. The housekeeper saw your car."


I should have parked around the block. Should have been smarter, faster, better at disappearing. But I'd never been the clever one, had I? That was Rose's role.


More footsteps. A deeper voice, Dad, probably called home from work to deal with his hysterical younger daughter.Again.


"Princess?" His voice carried that same gentle tone he'd used when I was twelve, crying about Rose getting my spot in the school play. "Let's talk about this."


A third set of footsteps made my blood freeze.Lighter, more graceful. Perfect, like everything else about her.

"Camille?" Rose's voice dripped concern. "Sweetie,please. Don't shut us out."


I looked at the family photo on my dresser, taken the day Rose's adoption was finalized. Mom and Dad beaming, Rose radiant in her new dress, thirteen-year-old me trying to smile through braces and acne.One big happy family.



What a joke.



The memory hit me like a punch to the gut:







"But I've been practicing for months!" | clutched my script, tears blurring the words. "Mrs. Bennett said the lead was mine!"



Rose touched my shoulder, gentle as always."Oh,sweetie. I didn't mean to take your part. I just... the words came so naturally in the audition. Mrs. Bennett said I had a gift."


Of course she did.Everyone said Rose had a gift. For music, for acting, for making people love her.
"Maybe..." Rose's eyes lit up with that special gleam that always meant trouble. "Maybe you could help me practice? Be my supporting actress? We could make it our sister thing!"


I'd agreed. Because that's what good sisters did.Because saying no to Rose meant disappointed looks from Mom, lectures from Dad about family loyalty.


Opening night, I watched from the wings as Rose brought the audience to tears. Afterward, Mom bought her roses. Dad took us all to dinner.


No one mentioned that I'd written Rose's best lines during our "practice sessions." Or that her dramatic monologue had been word-for-word what l'd performed in my original audition.


Rose just had a gift for memorization, that's all.






"Camille Elizabeth Lewis!" Mom's voice sharpened.

"This behavior is completely unacceptable."


I opened my bedroom door.
They stood in the hallway like a perfect family portrait, Mom in her designer suit, Dad looking distinguished in his work clothes, Rose wearing concern like the latest fashion trend.



"Hello, sister." My voice came out steady. "Shouldn't you be comforting your fiancé?"


Rose's eyes widened. Always the performer."Camille, please.Let me explain..."


"Explain what? How you've been sleeping with my husband? Or how you set this whole thing up from the beginning?"


"What is she talking about?" Dad turned to Rose,who already had tears forming. Perfect, delicate tears that never smeared her makeup.


"She's upset," Rose whispered. "Lashing out. You know how she gets, Daddy."


"Don't." My laugh sounded strange, even to me."Don't you dare play that card again. Show them the ring, Rose. The one Stefan gave you two months ago while I was supposedly too sick to attend the charity gala."



Mom gasped. Dad's face darkened. But Rose, Rose's mask slipped for just a second. I saw it this time, that flash of cold calculation behind the concern.



"It wasn't like that," she started.



"Really? Then how was it? Explain to everyone how you've been calling me every week, giving me marriage advice while sleeping with my husband.Tell them about all the times you helped me pick out lingerie for anniversaries when Stefan was really working late with you."



"That's enough!" Mom stepped forward. "Rose would never..."


"Never what, Mom? Never lie? Never manipulate?Never steal something that belonged to her sister?"|pulled out my phone, playing the last voicemail from Stefan.



His voice filledthe hallway: "Rose is my soulmate,
Camille. We tried to fight it, but some people are just meant to be together. You have to understand..."


The silence that followed was deafening.


Rose recovered first. "I never meant to hurt you.We can't help who we love..."


The sound of my palm connecting with her cheek echoed like a gunshot.


"Camille!" Mom grabbed my arm. "Have you lost your mind?"


"No," I said quietly, watching a red mark bloom on Rose's perfect face. "For the first time in fourteen years, I'm seeing clearly."


I walked past them, duffel bag in hand. Behind me,Rose's sobs started, the same performance she'd perfected over years of turning everyone against me.


"Where are you going?" Dad calledafter me. "You can't just walk away from family!"


I paused at the top of the stairs, looking back at my so-called family.Mom comforting Rose, Dad looking torn, and my sister watching me through her tears with eyes that held no warmth at all.


"Family?" | smiled, and something in my expression made them all step back. "No, this isn't family. This is a game. And for fourteen years, l've been playing by Rose's rules."



"Camille, please," Rose reached for me, ever the caring sister. "Let me make this right."


I caught her wrist before she could touch me. "You taught me well, big sister. About manipulation. About patience. About waiting for the perfect moment to strike."



Her eyes widened, real fear ths time, not performed.


"Thank you for the lessons," I whispered, letting her go. "Now watch how well I learned them."


I walked down the stairs, ignoring their calls. In the foyer mirror, I caught one last glimpse of myself,mascara-stained, wild-eyed, finally unchained.
###Chapter 3


ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW


I swirled the champagne in my crystal flute, watching the bubbles dance. Victory tasted sweet, just like I'd imagined all these years. The living room of my penthouse apartment overlooked the city where I'd spent twenty years pretending to be the perfect adopted daughter, the loving sister, the supportive friend.



What a joke.



"To freedom," I whispered to my reflection in the window. The woman staring back at me smiled,perfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect lies. Just like always.


My phone buzzed again. Another missed call from Stefan. He'd been calling non-stop since Camille walked out, probably worried I'd change my mind now that everything was in the open. Poor,predictable Stefan. Still thinking he was in control of any of this.


I kicked off my Louboutins and sank into the leather couch, letting memories wash over me like warm wine.







The first time I saw Camille Lewis, I hated her.


I was thirteen, fresh out of foster care, desperate to please my new parents. They'd brought me to this massive house with its manicured lawn and marble floors, promising me a fresh start. A real family.


Then this skinny thing with braces and messy hair came bouncing down the stairs, all eagersmiles and innocent eyes.


"Hi! I'm Camille. I've always wanted a sister!"


She hugged me right there in the foyer, not caring that my clothes were secondhand or that I smelled like the group home's industrial detergent. Just pure,genuine joy at having a sister.


I wanted to vomit.



Because there she was, this awkward, imperfect girl who had everything I'd spent thirteen years dreaming about. Parents who actually wanted her. A home she belonged in. A future secured by the Lewis family name.



And she didn't even appreciate it properly.


I watched her over dinner that first night, watched how she slouched in her chair and talked with her mouth full. How she didn't know which fork to use for salad. How she laughed too loud and asked too many questions.


"Rose has such lovely manners," Mrs. Lewis...Mom.....had said, smiling at me. "Perhaps you could learn from your new sister, Camille."


That's when I saw it. The first crack in Camille's perfect world. The slight dimming of her smile, the way she sat up straighter, tried harder.


It was beautiful.







My phone buzzed again, pulling me back to the present. Stefan's face lit up my screen, his fifth call in an hour. With a sigh, I answered.


"Darling, you're being needy."


"Rose." His voice was rough. Had he been drinking?"She's gone. Really gone. Blocked my number,cleaned out her closet..."


"Isn't that what we wanted?" I kept my voice gentle,soothing. The same tone I'd used all those times l'd counseled Camille through her marital problems.Problems I'd carefully orchestrated.


"I just... the way she looked at me..."


"Stefan, sweetheart." I let steel edge into my sweetness. "Are you having second thoughts? After everything we've been through?"
"No! No, of course not. I love you. I've always loved you."


"Then stop calling me about your ex-wife. It's pathetic."


I hung up, tossing the phone aside. Men were so predictably weak. Even Stefan, who l'd spent four years grooming before pushing him toward Camille,still needed constant management.


But he'd served his purpose. Just like everyone else in my carefully constructed game.


The family photo on my mantel caught my eye, my adoption day. I stood in the center, of course. Always the center. Camille pushed to the edge of the frame,trying so hard to smile through her insecurities.


God, it had been easy. Almost too easy.


A little whisper here about how Camille was unstable.

A few concerned conversations with Mom about how worried I was about my dear sister's emotional state.Casual mentions to Dad about how Camille seemed to be struggling with basic adult responsibilities.


Fourteen years of careful groundwork, positioning myself as the responsible daughter, the achievable dream, while slowly crushing Camille's confidence,her relationships, her sense of self.


The college rejection was particularly inspired, if I do say so myself. All it took was one tearful conversation with Mom about finding Camille's "secret" diary filled with dark thoughts and destructive plans. Plans I'd written myself, of course, in Camille's childish handwriting that I'd spent months practicing to forge.


Suddenly, their precious younger daughter wasn't ready for college. Needed time to "find herself."Needed to stay close to home where they could watch her.


Where I could watch her.


I took another sip of champagne, savoring the moment. Because this, this was what l'd really wanted all along. Not Stefan, he was just a useful pawn. Not the Lewis fortune, though that would come in time.


No,what I wanted was to watch perfect, precious Camille finally break. To see her realize that everything she thought she had family, love, security,had been built on my lies.


My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: "Rose,darling, please come over. Your father and I need to talk about what happened."


I smiled, already planning my performance. The tearful confusion, the reluctant confession about Stefan's pursuit, the gentle concern about Camille's mental state.



By the time I was done, they'd be thanking me for protecting them from their unstable daughter all these years.


Standing up, I walked to my closet, selecting the perfect outfit for my next scene. Something subtle but expensive.GGrieving sister, not celebrating victor.


The massive walk-in closet had been Camille's wedding gift to me. "So you'll always have space for your amazing fashion sense," she'd said, hugging me tight.


Even then, even after years of watching me steal every spotlight, every opportunity, every scrap of parental approval, she'd still loved me. Still trusted me.



Idiot.


I pulled out a cream cashmere sweater, remembering how Camille used to borrow my clothes in high school. How I'd wait until she had something important, a date, a presentation, an interview, then suddenly remember I needed that exact outfit.


She'd always given them back without argument.Always apologized for the inconvenience.


Always tried so hard to be the perfect sister.


My reflection caught my eye, and for a moment, just a moment, I saw something ugly there. Something that looked like the scared, angry foster kid who'd walked into the Lewis house all those years ago.


But then I blinked, and I was perfect Rose again.Flawless Rose. Rose who could do no wrong.


Slipping on my Cartier bracelet, another gift from my dear sister, I prepared for my next performance. The concerned family meeting would need just the right touch of reluctant honesty, devastated betrayal.


"Oh, Camille," I whispered to my reflection,practicing my worried frown. "What have you done to yourself?"


But as I turned to leave, something made me pause.That look in Camille's eyes before she'd walked out I'd never seen it before. Not in twenty years of pushing her, testing her, breaking her.


It had looked almost like... understanding.


Like she'd finally seen through my mask to the truth underneath.


I shook off the uneasy feeling. Camille was weak, just like I'd made her. She'd run away, lick her wounds,
maybe try to start over somewhere new.


But she'd never be free of me. I'd made sure of that years ago
###Chapter 4


STEFAN'S POINT OF VIEW


The scotch burned going down, but I poured another anyway. My third? Fourth? I'd lost count somewhere between signing those divorce papers and watching Camille walk away.


Our wedding photo still sat on my desk, mocking me.Camille's genuine smile, my distracted eyes, already looking past her, always looking for Rose.


Rose.



Even her name felt like betrayal now.


My phone lit up with another message from her:"Darling, stop drinking and come over. We should celebrate."



Celebrate. Like we hadn't just destroyed someone 
who loved us. Someone who'd given me three years of devotion I never deserved.



The memory hit me like a punch to the gut.







"Stefan?" Camille's voice was small, uncertain. "Did I do something wrong?"


I looked up from my laptop, irritated at the interruption. She stood in the doorway of my home office, holding a plate of something that smelled amazing.


"I made that pasta you mentioned. The one with truffles?" Her eyes were hopeful. "Rose gave me the recipe..."


Of course she had. Rose had made that pasta for me in Rome, years ago. Back when we were...whatever we were.



"I'm busy." | didn't even look at the plate. "Just leave it."
"Oh." A pause. "It's just, you've been working late all week,and I thought..."


"Camille." My voice sharp with an anger that wasn't really meant for her. "I said I'm busy."


She left the plate and disappeared, quiet as always.The pasta sat untouched until morning, a perfect recreation of a memory that belonged to another woman.







I hurled my glass at the wall, watching crystaI shatter like the life I'd built on lies.


God, I'd been cruel. Not just at the end, but throughout our marriage. Every missed dinner, every forgotten anniversary, every time l'd chosen work over her, all excuses to avoid the guilt of wanting her sister.


My phone buzzed again. Mother this time.


"Darling, I just heard from Rose. Are you alright? Do you need anything? I always said Camille wasn't suited for our family..."


I silenced the phone, remembering another moment I'd tried to forget.







"She's trying so hard, Stefan." Rose's voice was gentle as she poured me another drink. We were alone in my office after another disastrous family dinner. "Maybe if you gave her more guidance..."


"Like you did?" I couldn't keep the bitterness from my voice. "Teaching her all the ways to be perfect?"


Rose's laugh was musical, practiced. Everything about her was practiced. "Are you saying you preferred me imperfect?"



The air between us crackled with unspoken history.Four years of passion and plans, ended by her sudden departure to London. Or so she'd claimed.


"Why did you really leave?" The question slipped out,colored by whiskey and old pain.
"You know why." She touched my cheek, familiar and forbidden. "Camille needed a chance at happiness.We both agreed..."


Had we? I couldn't remember anymore. Everything from that time felt hazy, manipulated. Like watching a play where I'd forgotten my lines.


"She loves you," Rose whispered, too close now."More than I ever could."


But her eyes said something different. They always had.







Another memory surfaced, this one from last week.The moment everything changed.







"| made your favorite breakfast." Camille's smile was bright, genuine. Always so damn genuine. "Happy anniversary."


The divorce papers burned in my briefcase, Rose's perfume still lingering on my clothes from our late-night "meeting."


"I can't." | grabbed my keys, avoiding her eyes. "Early meeting."


"Oh." Her voice cracked slightly. "Will you be home for dinner? I thought we could..."


"Don't wait up."


I'd spent that evening with Rose, planning how to break the news. She'd worn the same perfume she'd worn in Rome, all those years ago.


"It's kinder this way," she'd said, stroking my hair. "A clean break. Camille will understand eventually."


Would she? The look in her eyes when she'd seen Rose's photo...






My office door opened, startling me from the memory. Mother stood there, perfectly coiffed even at midnight.
"Really, darling. Drinking alone in the dark?"


"Not now,Mother."


She clicked across the room, surveying the broken glass with disapproval. "Rose is worried about you.We all are."


"Worried?" I laughed, harsh and broken. "Like you were worried about Camille all these years?"


"That girl was never right for you." Mother's voice hardened. "Rose, on the other hand..."


"Stop." I stood, unsteady. "Just... stop."


"Stefan Rodriguez, you will not speak to me that way.I raised you better..."


"Did you?" The words exploded out of me. "You raised me to what? String along a woman who loved me while pining for her sister? Listen to you tear her down at every opportunity?"



Mother stepped back, shocked. In twenty eight years, I'd never raised my voice to her.
"Everything she did was wrong, wasn't it?" I continued, the scotch making me brave. "Her clothes, her manners, her cooking. Nothing was ever good enough. But Rose... Rose was perfect."


"Because she understands our world!She..."


"She understands manipulation." The truth hit me like a freight train. "She played us all. You, me, Camille..."


"Don't be ridiculous." Mother straightened her designer jacket. "Rose loves you. She always has."


Had she? Or had she loved the game more?


I remembered the cold calculation in her eyes when she'd orchestrated our "chance" meetings after returning from London. The way she'd encouraged Camille's insecurities while playing the supportive sister.



Even our reunion two months ago felt staged now.The charity gala, Camille conveniently"sick," Rose in that dress I'd loved in Rome...


"Mother." I sank back into my chair, suddenly exhausted."Please leave."


"Stefan..."


"Go. Tell Rose... tell her..." What? That I wvas sorry?That I finally saw through her perfect mask? That I'd destroyed my marriage for a fantasy she'd carefully crafted?


Mother left, her disappointment hanging in the air like expensive perfume. Like Rose's perfume. Like all the artificial, manipulated pieces of this life I'd chosen.


My phone lit up with another message. Rose again:"Darling, stop being dramatic. Come home.To me."


Home.


I looked around my office, at the shattered glass and scattered papers. At Camille's wedding photo,her genuine smile now seeming like an accusation.


What had I done?
###Chapter 5



CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW



The parking garage of the hotel where i lodged was too quiet. My heels echoed against concrete, each click bouncing off empty cars and shadowed pillars.It was late, past midnight, but something felt wrong.Off.



My confrontation with Rose and my family had left me drained, empty except for the cold satisfaction of finally seeing behind her mask. I fumbled with my key fob, wanting nothing more than to get to my hotel room and plan my next move.


A car door slammed somewhere in the darkness.



I stopped, listening. Nothing but the hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of traffic.
My phone buzzed in my purse. Rose's number.declined it, but not before noticing my signal had dropped to one bar.


Perfect.



Footsteps behind me. Multiple sets.


I walked faster, cursing my choice of heels. The hotel's elevator wNas just around the corner, past a row of concrete pillars. If I could just...


"Going somewhere, Mrs. Rodriguez?"


A man stepped out from behind a pillar. Tall,broad-shouldered, dressed in black. Professional. Two more appeared behind me, cutting off my retreat.


Not a random attack, then.


"Actually, it's Ms. Lewis now." My voice stayed steady despite my racing heart. "And I have a dinner reservation, so if you'll excuse me..."

The first man smiled. It wasn't a nice smile."I'm afraid your plans have changed."
I gripped my purse tighter, feeling for the pepper spray I'd started carrying after signing the divorce papers. "Did my sister send you? Or was it Stefan?"


"Our employer prefers to remain anonymous." He stepped closer. "Now, we can do this the easy way..."


I didn't let him finish. The pepper spray caught him directly in the eyes.


He screamed, stumbling backward. I ran, kicking off my heels as I sprinted for the elevator. The other two men shouted, their footsteps thundering behind me.


Almost there. Just a few more...



Pain exploded in my scalp as someone grabbed my hair, yanking me backward. My purse went flying,contents scattering across the concrete.


"That wasn't very nice." The first man's voice was rough with pain and rage. "Hold her."


Strong hands gripped my arms. I fought, kicking,scratching, but they were too strong. Professional.Trained.

"Our employer said you might be difficult." The first man wiped his streaming eyes. "Said you needed to learn your place."


Rose. This had Rose written all over it. Her parting shot, making sure I understood just how powerless really was.


"If you're going to kill me," I spat, "at least have the guts to look me in the eyes."


He laughed. "Kill you? No, no.Just a message.A reminder of what happens to people who don't know when to let go."



The first punch caught me in the stomach, driving the air from my lungs. I doubled over, gasping,but the men holding me kept me upright.


"See, some people don't understand their role in life." Another blow, this one to my ribs. "Some people need to be taught..."


I tasted blood. My vision blurred, pain shooting through my body. But I wouldn't cry. WNouldn't give Rose the satisfaction.



"That's enough."


The voice cut through the garage like a whip crack.Female.Authoritative.



My attackers tensed. Through swollen eyes, I saw dark figures emerging from the shadows. Men in suits, moving with military precision. And behind them...


A woman. Tall, elegant, probably in her fifties but with an ageless quality about her. She wore a black designer suit that probably cost more than my car,her silver hair swept into a perfect chignon.



But it was her eyes that caught me. Sharp, intelligent,and oddly...familiar.


"Ma'am," one of my attackers started, "our employer..."


"Is about to have a very bad day." The woman's voice was ice. "Release her. Now."
The hands holding me disappeared. I slumped forward,pain shooting through my ribs.


"Secure them." The woman's command sent her men moving. My attackers didn't even try to run. They knew better.



She walked toward me, heels clicking on concrete.Designer shoes. Probably cost more than my monthly rent.


"Camille Lewis." Not a question. She knew exactly who | was.


I tried to straighten, to maintain some dignity despite my split lip and torn dress. "Do I know you?"


Her eyes softened, just slightly. Like she was seeing something, someone else in my face.


"No." She gestured, and more men appeared with a medical kit. "But I knew someone very much like you,once. Someone who also had to learn the hard way about trust and betrayal."


The world was getting fuzzy around the edges. Blood dripped onto my ruined dress, each breath sending knives through my ribs.


"Who..." I swayed, darkness creeping in. "Who are you?"


She stepped forward, catching me as my knees buckled. This close, I could smell her perfume,something expensive, unique. Something that tickled at the edges of my memory.


"Someone who's been watching you for a very long time, Camille." Her voice seemed to come from far away. "Someone who's going to help you become everything they tried to prevent."


The darkness was winning now. But before it took me completely, I heard her last words:


"After all... you look just like my daughter."


Then nothing but black.
###Chapter 6


CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW


I woke to silk sheets and sunlight. For a moment, I thought I was back in my childhood bedroom,before everything fell apart. But the ceiling above me was unfamiliar, hand-painted cherubs floating in a cloudless sky, framed by gilded molding that probably cost more than my entire wedding.


Pain shot through my ribs as I tried to sit up,memories flooding back. The parking garage.Rose's hired thugs. The mysterious woman with silver hair.


"Careful." A voice from the doorway made me turn."Three bruised ribs and a mild concussion. The doctor said you need rest."


She stood there like something from a fashion magazine, tailored black pants suit, pearls that definitely weren't fake, silver hair swept into an elegant twist. But it was her eyes that held me.Sharp.Calculating.Hauntingly familiar.


"Where am I?" My voice was rough. "Who are you?"


"You're safe." She moved into the room with fluid grace, settling into a chair beside my bed. "As for who l am...my name is Victoria Kane."


The name hit like a physical shock. Everyone knew Victoria Kane, the ruthless CEO who'd built Kane Industries from nothing, the woman Forbes called 'The Queen of Wall Street.' She was worth billions,moved markets with a phone call, and was rumored to be more powerful than most governments.


"Why..." I swallowed hard."Why am I here?"


Something flickered in her eyes, pain, maybe, or memory."Because Three years ago, I saw a photo in a society magazine. A young woman at some charity gala, wearing a dress that didn't quite fit, smiling bravely whle her 'perfect' sister held court."
The gala. One of Rose's many triumphs, orchestrated to highlight the difference between us.


"The photo caught my attention," Victoria continued,"but it was your eyes that made me look closer.They were...familiar."



She reached for her phone, pulling upan image that made my breath catch. A young woman, maybe my age, with my face. My eyes. MAy smile.


"Your daughter?" The resemblance was uncanny.


"Sophia." Victoria's voice softened. "She would have been thirty-two this year."


Would have been. The words hung heavy in the air.


"What happened?"


"Car accident. Ten years ago." Her fingers traced the photo. "Though 'accident' is a polite fiction. Her fiancé's family didn't approve of the match. Brake lines are so easily tampered with."


Ice slid down my spine. "Did they..."
"Face consequences?" A smile that could cut glasS."Eventually. But that's not why you're here."


She set down her phone, fixing me with that penetrating gaze. "After I saw your photo, I had you investigated. Learned about your family dynamics.Your marriage. Your sister's... activities."


"You've been watching me?" It should have felt creepy, but somehow it didn't. "Why?"


"Because I recognized something in you. Something |saw in Sophia. Raw potential, wrappedd in other people's expectations. A diamond they tried to pass off as glass."


My heart pounded. "I don't understand."


"Don't you?" She leaned forward. "I watched you try to fit their mold. Watched you shut away parts of yourself to please them. Watched them clip your wings while convincing you it was for your own good."


Tears burned my eyes. "Like the college acceptance."


"Which Rose sabotaged. Yes, I know about that too.Just like I know about the diary she forged, the jobs she made sure you didn't get, the friends she slowly turned against you."


"You know everything." My voice cracked. "And you just...watched?"


"I waited." She stood, moving to the window. "Waited to see if you'd break or bloom. Waited for the moment you finally saw through their perfect lies."


The confrontation with Rose flashed through my mind."And now?"



"Now?" She turned back to me, sunlight casting her in silhouette. "Now I'm offering you a choice. You can walk away from all of this. I'll set you up somewhere new, comfortable, far from them. Or..."


"Or?"


"Or I can teach you to be what they always feared you might become. Powerful. Independent. Free."
She moved back to my bedside, and suddenly I saw what made her so formidable. It wasn't just the money or the influence. It was the absolute certainty that the world would bend to her will.


"Your sister spent twenty years teaching you about manipulation," she continued. "Let me teach you about power. Real power, not the petty games she plays."


"Why?" I had to know. "Because I look like your daughter?"


"No." Her hand touched mine, surprisingly warm."Because you look like I did, forty years ago. Before |learned that the world doesn't give you what you deserve, it gives you what you have the strength to take."



I stared at our joined hands, seeing the perfect manicure that probably cost more than my monthly salary."And if I say yes?"


"Then I adopt you. Publicly, legally, completely. You become Camille Kane, heir to everything l've built."
Her smile turned sharp. "Imagine your sister's face when she realizes the investor she's been desperately courting is her 'weak' little sister."


The thought sent a thrill through me. "She'd lose her mind."



"That's just the beginning. I'll teach you everything l know. Business. Strategy. Power. In five years, you won't just survive their games, you'll rewrite the rules."



"And what do you get out of this?"


Victoria's eyes met mine, and for a moment I saw/raw honesty. "A chance to finish what Sophia started.A chance to see someone bloom instead of break.And... A pause. "A chance to have a daughter again."


I thought about my life, the careful box they'd put me in, the dreams they'd stolen, the lies they'd fed me.Thought about Rose's smug smile and Stefan's betrayal and my parents' willing blindness.
"When do we start?"


Victoria's smile was like sunrise, brilliant and inevitable. "We already have."


She reached for a folder on the bedside table. "First,we need to establish your disappearance. Make them think their thugs succeeded."


"Let them think I'm..." Understanding dawned. "Let them think they broke me."


"For now." She opened the folder, revealing documents, passports, bank statements. "While you heal, while you learn, while you become who you were meant to be."



I sat up straighter, ignoring the pain in my ribs. "And then?"


"And then?" Victoria Kane, my new mother, smiled like a queen bestowing kingdoms. "Then we show them exactly what happens when you try to cage a wolf in sheep's clothing."


Looking at her, I finally understood what real power looked like. Not Rose's petty manipulations or Stefan's inherited privilege. This was something else.Something primal. Something they'd tried to crush in me.



But they'd failed.


And now they'd pay.


"When can I sign the papers?" | asked.


Victoria's laugh was rich with promise. "That's my girl."


For the first time in fourteen years, those words felt true.
###Chapter 7


ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW



My phone buzzed while I was getting my nails done.Normally, I'd ignore it, Tuesday afternoons are my me-time, after all. But something made me look.Maybe it was intuition. Maybe it was fate. Maybe it was just that delicious feeling I'd had all morning,like something wonderful was about to happen.


The headline made me smear the perfect French manicure Julie had just finished on my right hand.


"LOCAL WOMAN FEARED DEAD AFTER CAR FOUND IN RIVER"



My hands shook as I clicked the link, not caring about the ruined nail polish. There it was, in clean black and white: Camille Elizabeth Lewis, age 25,presumed dead after her car was discovered in the Morton River early Tuesday morning. No body recovered.Search ongoing.


"Oh my God," I whispered, but inside, fireworks were going off.Champagne corks were popping. Every cell in my body wanted to jump up and dance.


"Everything okay, Miss Lewis?" Julie asked,concerned about my trembling hands.


I forced my face into the appropriate expression of shock and grief. "My sister... there's been an accident.I...I need to go."


The drive home was torture, having to keep my face properly devastated while my heart soared like a bird finally freed from its cage. I barely made it through my front door before the laughter bubbled up, wild and a little hysterical.-


She'd actually done it. My pathetic, clingy little sister had finally done something right. She'd disappeared exactly like I'd arranged, right down to the car in the river. Those guys I hired through three different cutouts had followed my instructions perfectly.

I poured myself a glass of the CristaI I'd been saving for a special occasion. This definitely qualified.Taking my phone and the champagne, I curled up in my favorite window seat, the one with the perfect view of the garden Camille used to love so much.


The articles were everywhere now. Local news, social media, even some regional outlets picking up the story. I scrolled through them like love letters, each one sweeter than the last. The photos they'd chosen were perfect, Camille always photographed terribly,looking washed-out and uncertain next to my carefully curated glamour. Even in death, she was my shadow.



"To you, little sister," I whispered, raising my glass to the empty room. "Thanks for finally getting out of my way."


My phone rang, Stefan, right on cue. I took a deep breath, arranged my voice into something appropriately broken.


"Baby?" I let my voice crack. "Did you... did you see?"
"Rose, I'm so sorry." He sounded genuinely upset,the fool. "I'm on my way over. You shouldn't be alone right now."


Perfect.Absolutely perfect. "I just can't believe she's gone," I said, adding a little sob for effect."My baby sister..."


"We'll get through this together," he promised.


I ended the call and smiled at my reflection in the window. Yes,we would get through this together, just as soon as an appropriate mourning period had passed. Six months, maybe. Eight at the most. Then Stefan would turn to me for comfort, and I'd finally have everything I'd spent four years carefully arranging.


The house would need to be dark when he arrived.Grief-stricken. I went around drawing curtains,creating the perfect stage set for my performance.The grieving sister, devastated by loss, turning to her sister's widow for support... it was almost poetic.


My phone buzzed again, Mommy this time. I let it ring twice before answering.


"Rose?" Her voice was thick with tears. "Please tell me it's not true."



"Mommy..." | forced a sob. "They found her car...in the river..."



"No, no, no..." The raw pain in her voice sent a thril through me. This was what I'd wanted all these years,to be the only daughter, the only focus of their attention. No more splitting their love with my pale imitation of a sister.



"The police think..." I paused for effect. "They think she might have done it on purpose. She's been so strange lately, so distant..."


The seeds I'd planted over the past months were blooming beautifully. The subtle hints about Camille's depression, the careful suggestions that she wasn't coping well with life. Everyone would believe it.They'd shake their heads and say what a tragedy it was, and how they should have seen the signs.


"I should have helped her more," Mom wailed."Should have been there..."


"We all should have," I soothed, while inside | was dancing. "But you know Camille, she never wanted to burden anyone."


After I got off the phone, I kicked off my heels and spun around my living room, champagne sloshing over the rim of my glass. Free! Finally, gloriously free!No more perfect little Camille with her sad eyes and quiet judgment. No more competing for attention, for love,for anything.


I caught sight of a photo on the mantel, me and Camille at her wedding, her maid of honor dress carefully chosen to make her look frumpy next to my designer gown. I picked it up, studying her face.She'd never understood how the world really worked.How you had to take what you wanted, how kindness was just weakness in disguise.


"You should thank me," I told her image. "I've given you the perfect exit. Everyone will remember you as the tragic, beautiful soul who couldn't bear the world's cruelty. Better than letting them see what a failure you really were."


The doorbell rang, Stefan, right on time. I set down the photo and checked my makeup in the hall mirror.The waterproof mascara was artfully smudged, my eyes red from the champagne.Perfect.


"Remember," I whispered to my reflection, "you're devastated. Broken. Lost without your beloved sister."



I opened the door to find Stefan looking wrecked, his blue eyes red-rimmed. Such a sensitive soul. It was one of the things that had drawn me to him,that and his family's money, of course.


"Oh, Stefan!" | threw myself into his arms, letting him hold me while I shook with what he would think were sobs.


"I've got you," he murmured into my hair. "We'll get through this together."


Over his shoulder, I smiled. Yes, we would. Just not the way he imagined.


I let him lead me to the couch, arrange me carefully among the cushions. He went to get me water,sweet,predictable Stefan, while I checked my phone again. #RIPCamille was trending locally. The news coverage was expanding. People were sharing memories, posting old photos.


Perfect. Simply perfect.


"I just keep thinking," I said when Stefan returned,"about all the things left unsaid. All the time we'll never have..."


He sat beside me, pulling me close, and I nestled into him like I belonged there. In a way, I did. Everything was falling into place exactly as I'd planned.


Camille was gone, Stefan was here, and soon, so soon, I'd have everything I'd ever wanted. The fortune, the status, the perfect life, all mine, with no pale shadow of a sister to dim my spotlight.


"To new beginnings," I whispered into Stefan's shirt,too soft for him to hear.


Outside, it started to rain, nature's own tribute to my triumph. I closed my eyes and smiled, letting Stefan mistake my expression for grief.


Goodbye, little sister. Thanks for finally doing something right.
###Chapter 8


CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW


The nightmare grabbed me by the throat, dragging me under before| could fight back.


I was standing in the rain outside a restaurant, my face pressed against cold glass, watching Rose and Stefan inside. They sat at a candlelit table,champagne glasses raised in a toast. Stefan wore the tie l'd given him last Christmas. Rose wore my engagement ring.


Their laughter reached me somehow, cutting through the glass barrier. They were laughing at me.


"Did you see her face?" Rose's voice echoed unnaturally loud. "When she found the divorce papers? Like a stupid puppy being abandoned at the shelter."
Stefan chuckled, pouring more champagne."And when she realized it was you? God, I almost felt sorry for her."



"Almost," Rose agreed, her smile shark-like. "But not quite. She made it too easy, Stef. Always so desperate to be loved. So willing to believe the lies."


They clinked glasses again. The sound transformed into breaking glass, shattering windows, car metal crumpling...


The scene shifted. I was in my car, rain hammering the windshield, wipers fighting a losing battle against the downpour. My cheeks were wet-tears or rain,I couldn't tell anymore.


Headlights appeared behind me, too bright,too fast.Gaining.


I gripped the steering wheel tighter, foot pressing the accelerator. The headlights grew closer, lighting up my rearview mirror until I was blind.


A bump.Metal against metal. My car swerved.
Then I was flying, the world spinning as my car broke through the bridge railing. That weightless moment of suspension before gravity remembered me.


The water rushed up.


I screamed, the sound ending in a gurgle as icy water filled my lungs. As I sank, I saw them standing on the bridge. Rose. Stefan. My parents. All watching impassively as I drowned.


Rose waved goodbye, her smile triumphant.


"Should we call someone?" my mother asked, not particularly concerned.


"Why bother?" my father replied. "She was always such a disappointment."


The water closed over my head, and darkness pulled me down, down, down...


I woke gasping, sheets tangled around my legs like grasping hands. For terrifying seconds, I couldn't remember where I was. The ceiling above me was unfamiliar, painted cherubs, golden trim, luxury | hadn't earned.


Victoria. The adoption.My new life.


Reality settled back, but the terror remained,clinging to my skin like river mud. I pushed myself upright,ignoring the protest from my healing ribs. Sweat plastered my nightgown to my body, and my heart hammered against my chest like it was trying to escape.


The digital clock on the bedside table glowed 3:17AM. Too early to be awake, too late to hope for peaceful sleep. I swung my legs over the side of the bed, needing to move, to prove to myself I wasn't drowning.


The marble floor was cold against my bare feet as l padded to the bathroom, flipping on lights as I wNent.The woman in the mirror was a stranger - hollow eyes, skin pale as paper, hair wild from thrashing in my sleep.


I splashed cold water on my face, trying to wash away the nightmare's residue. But when I closed my eyes, I saw them again. Laughing. Toasting.Celebrating my destruction.


A sound escaped me, something between a laugh and a sob. The absurdity suddenly hit me-I was standing in a bathroom worth more than my old car,in a mansion owned by one of the world's wealthiest women, who wanted to adopt me because I looked like her dead daughter.


The laugh bubbled up again, louder this time, edged with hysteria. I pressed my hand against my mouth,trying to hold it in, but it was too late. The dam had broken.


I slid down the bathroom wall until I hit the floor,laughter transforming to sobs that tore through my chest. Every breath hurt my bruised ribs, but l couldn't stop. Years of swallowed tears demanded release.


I cried for the little girl who'd never been enough. For the college dreams crushed by Rose's lies. For three years of marriage to a man who'd never truly seen me. For the weak, trusting fool l'd been, giving chances to people who only wanted to use them against me.


My hands curled into fists, nails digging half-moons into my palms. The physical pain was almost a relief,something solid to focus on instead of the gaping emptiness inside.


"Enough."


The voice cut through my breakdown like a knife.Victoria stood in the doorway, silver hair loose around her shoulders, wrapped in a black silk robe.Her face gave nothing away, but her eyes were sharp,assessing.


Shame burned through me. She'd offered me strength, power, a chance at revenge, and here I was,dissolving on her bathroom floor at three in the morning. Proving everyone right about weak,emotional Camille.



I tried to stand, to salvage some dignity, but my legs wouldn't cooperate. "I'm sorry," I managed,voice raw from crying. "The nightmare..."
"Tell me." Not a request.A command.


I hesitated, then described the dream in halting sentences. The restaurant. The bridge. The water.Their faces as they watched me drown.


Victoria listened without interruption, without pitying murmurs or comforting platitudes. When I finished,she simply nodded.


"Get up."


I stared at her. "What?"



"Get up," she repeated, extending one hand. "This floor is no place for a Kane."②


Her words hit like a splash of cold water. This floor was no place for a Kane. And that's who I was now,or who I was becoming. Not weak Camille Lewis, but Camille Kane.Heir. Survivor. Avenger.


I took her hand, letting her pull me to my feet. Her grip was surprisingly strong for a woman her age,fingers cool and dry against my tear-damp skin.
"Follow me," she said, turning without checking if l would obey.


I followed her through darkened hallways, past priceless artwork and antiques that glowed dimly in the shadows. We descended a grand staircase, my bare feet silent on plush carpet, and entered a part of the mansion I hadn't seen before.

###Chapter 9


Victoria stopped at a heavy wooden door, unlocking it with a key from her robe pocket. Inside was a home gym unlike any I'd ever seen, state-of-the-art equipment, mirrors covering one wall, a boxing ring taking up the center of the room.


She flipped on lights that mimicked daylight, making me blink at the sudden brightness. Without a word,she crossed to a cabinet and extracted hand wraps and boxing gloves.


"Put these on."



I took them, bewildered. "Victoria, it's the middle of the night."


"And you're awake, drowning in self-pity instead of planning your resurrection." Her voice wasn't cruel,just matter-of-fact. "So put them on."
My hands trembled as I wrapped them, clumsy from inexperience. Victoria watched, neither helping nor criticizing, until I managed to secure the gloves.


"Hit that." She pointed to a heavy bag hanging in the corner.



I approached it uncertainly. "I've never boxed before."



"I'm not teaching you to box. I'm teaching you to channel your rage." She positioned herself behind the bag, holding it steady. "Now hit it. Hard as you can."


Feeling foolish, I threw a weak punch. The bag barely moved.


"Again. Harder. Think of Rose's face when she saw you at the house that day."


I hit again, putting slightly more force behind it.


"Pathetic. Is that all the anger you have? After what she did to you?" Victoria's voice hardened. "Think of Stefan signing those divorce papers on your anniversary. Think of your mother comforting Rose while you walked away bleeding."


Heat bloomed in my chest, anger flickering to life.I threw another punch, then another, each one harder than the last.


"Better. Now think of them laughing in that restaurant. Toasting your destruction. Planning your replacement."


The image from my nightmare flashed before me,champagne glasses clinking, Rose wearing my ring,Stefan in the tie I'd given him. Something snapped inside me. My next punch slammed into the bag with a force that surprised even me.


"Yes!" Victoria's approval fueled me. "Again. Think of the men who attacked you. Think of your parents choosing Rose over you for fourteen years."


I lost myself in the rhythm of it, fists connecting with leather again and again. Each punch carried away a piece of hurt, of betrayal, of worthlessness. I hit until my arms burned and sweat soaked my nightgown,

until tears mixed with perspiration on my face.


I hit until I had nothing left.


When I finally stopped, chest heaving, Victoria released the bag and handed me a towel without comment.I wiped my face, suddenly exhausted but oddly... cleaner somehow. Like I'd purged something toxic from my system.


"This is the last time," Victoria said, unwrapping the gloves from my hands. "The last time you break for them. The last time you cry over people who never deserved your tears."


I met her eyes, seeing not pity but recognition.Understanding. She knew this journey because she'd walked it herself.



"Tomorrow, we begin." She checked her watch, a discreet Patek Philippe that probably cost more than a year's rent at my old apartment. "In exactly four hours, you'll meet with the lawyers to finalize the adoption papers. By noon, you'll be legally Camille Kane. By evening, you'll have begun your education in finance, business strategy, and social warfare."


She tossed the gloves into a basket and turned to face me fully, silver hair gleaming under the lights.


"Tonight was necessary. Grief must be acknowledged before it can be transformed. But from sunrise onward, you are no longer their victim.You are my protégé. My heir.My daughter."


The word 'daughter' hung in the air between us,weighted with expectations and possibilities. I straightened my shoulders, ignoring the protest from my ribs.


"What if I'm not strong enough?"


Victoria's smile was sharp as a blade. "Strength isn't something y/ou're born with. It's something you build,one painful brick at a time. And you, Camille, have been gathering bricks for years without knowing it."


She moved toward the door, pausing with her hand on the light switch. "Each betrayal, each disappointment, each moment they underestimated you - those are your building materials. Now we construct something magnificent from them."


I followed her from the gym, back through silent hallways that would soon become familiar. My home.My fortress.My launching pad.


At my bedroom door, Victoria paused. For a moment,I thought she might embrace me, offer some maternal comfort after the night's emotional storm.Instead, she simply touched my shoulder, a brief pressure that conveyed more than words could have.


"Sleep if you can," she said. "If not, start reading the files I left on your desk. The first details your sister's recent business ventures. She's seeking investors for a boutique clothing line, apparently."


An investor. Rose, who'd stolen my husband, my family, my dignity, was now seeking money. The irony was almost poetic.



"How long before she knows?" | asked. "That I'm alive. That I'm... yours."
Victoria's smile held all the warm comfort of a circling shark. "We'll wait until you're ready. Until you can look her in the eye and feel nothing but cold satisfaction. Until your hand doesn't shake when you sign the papers denying her funding."


I nodded, something new settling into my bones.Something hard and certain.


"Rest," Victoria said, turning away. "Tomorrow is the first day of your new life."


I entered my room, closing the door softly behind me. The nightmare's grip had faded, replaced by something sharper, clearer. Purpose. Direction. For the first time in years, perhaps ever, I knew exactly who I needed to become.


Not the good sister. Not the perfect wife. Not the pleasing daughter.


Someone new.Someone dangerous.


Someone who would make them all regret the day they decided Camille Lewis wasn't worth keeping.
Someone who would make them all regret the day they decided Camille Lewis wasn't worth keeping.


I caught my reflection in the window glass,disheveled, eyes red-rimmed, buIt standing straight.

###Chapter 10


CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW


The black car moved through morning fog, tires humming against wet roads. I stared out the window,watching trees blur into gray mist. Victoria sat beside me, her face a mask of calm, but her fingers tapped a nervous rhythm on her leather bag.


"Where are we going?" | asked, breaking the silence that had stretched between us since we left the mansion thirty minutes ago. The papers making me officially Camille Kane had been signed at dawn, the ink barely dry.


Victoria's eyes stayed fixed on the passing landscape."To meet someone important."


The car turned onto a narrow road lined with tall iron gates and stone walls. A cemetery. My stomach tightened.


"Sophia?"| whispered.


Victoria nodded once, sharp and quick, like admitting pain. "Today marks ten years since I lost her."


The cemetery was empty of visitors, kept private by security guards who nodded respectfully as our car passed. Ancient trees created a natural cathedral over graves that dated back centuries. This was no ordinary resting place, but one reserved for families with names that appeared in history books.


Our driver stopped at the end of a curving path. "We walk from here," Victoria said, gathering her bag and stepping out without waiting for help.


I followed her along a stone path that wound uphill toward a secluded corner overlooking the city. The grass here was greener, the flowers fresher. Clearly tended with special care.


We stopped before a white marble headstone,simple yet elegant. Quality that whispered rather than shouted.


SOPHIA ELIZABETH KANE


BELOVED DAUGHTER



TAKEN TOO SOON



1990-2013


Below those words, a single line of poetry: "Some souls are too bright for this world."


Victoria placed white lilies by the stone, her movements practiced yet tender. I hung back, feeling like an intruder on this private grief.


"Come," she said, not looking at me. "She would want to meet you."


I stepped forward, uneasy. What do you say to a grave of someone you never knew? Someone whose death made your new life possible?


Victoria knelt despite her expensive suit, uncaring about grass stains or dirt. "Hello, my darling," she said, touching the carved letters of Sophia's name.
"I've brought someone to meet you."


The wind picked up, sending fallen leaves dancing around us. I zipped my jacket higher, shivering from more than just cold.


"Tell me about her," I said. "The real story, not the public version."


Victoria was quiet so long I thought she wouldn't answer. When she spoke, her voice had lost its usual sharp edge.


"Sophia was brilliant. Graduated MIT at twenty. Could solve equations that baffled men twice her age. But she was also kind, which I failed to teach her." A bitter smile crossed her lips. "That she learned despite me."


I waited as Victoria gathered her thoughts, watching her fingers trace her daughter's name over and over.


"She fell in love with Oliver Preston. Old money, old connections.Handsome, charming, seemed perfect.His family owned shipping companies that competed with our tech enterprises."


Victoria's face hardened. "They never thought her good enough. The Kanes were new money, self-made. I came from nothing. Built everything. They came from generations of wealth, of 'proper breeding.' They thought Sophia beneath them."


The familiar sting of rejection echoed in my chest.Always being measured and found wanting.


"What happened?" I asked, though part of me already knew.



"They were engaged six months when she died. Car crash on a mountain road. Brake lines cut." Victoria's voice turned to ice. "Police called it an accident.I knew better."



She stood, brushing dirt from her knees. "The Prestons celebrated quietly. Their son free to marry someone from the 'right' background. They underestimated how far a mother would go for justice."
The look in her eyes made me shiver again. This wasn't grief anymore, but something harder. Colder.


"One by one, their companies failed. Stock prices crashed. Ships lost at sea. Mysterious audits.Computer systems failing. Nothing that could be traced back to me, of course."


Victoria's smile was terrible to behold. "Oliver married the girl they chose. Three months later,he jumped from his penthouse. Left a note confessing he'd known about the brake lines. Couldn't live with the guilt."


I swallowed hard. "And the rest of the family?"


"Bankrupt within two years. Their homes sold. Their treasures auctioned. The Preston name forgotten by society that once bowed to them."


Victoria looked at me fully now. "That's the lesson,Camille. Revenge isn't about violence or threats.It's about patience. About being smarter. About taking what matters most to those who hurt you."
She opened her bag, removing a small wooden chest. Beautifully carved, with silver hinges and lock.About the size of a jewelry box.


"This brings us to why we're here today."


She held out the box to me. I took it, feeling its surprising weight.


"What is it?"


"Your funeral." Victoria's eyes were steady on mine."For Camille Lewis."



Understanding dawned slowly."You want me to..."


"Put everything inside. Every memory, attachment,and weakness of your old life. Everything that was Camille Lewis must go in that box."


I stared at the chest in my hands, suddenly unsteady on my feet.


"You can't become who you need to be while clinging to who you were," Victoria continued. "The woman they hurt, they used, they discarded, she must die here today."


My fingers traced the carved wood. "And if I'm not ready?"


"Then this ends now. You go back to being Camille Lewis, and I help y/ou start somewhere new, with a comfortable but ordinary life." Her voice softened slightly. "There's no shame in that choice. But there's no revenge in it either."


The weight of the moment pressed down on me.Step forward or back. Choose power or peace.Become the hunter or remain the hunted.



I opened the box.


Its interior was lined with dark blue velvet. Empty,waiting. Like the future stretching before me, a blank page | could fill however | chose.


With trembling hands, I reached for my purse. Inside was all I had left of my old life. The few things I'd grabbed before leaving the house that day, plus what Victoria's people had collected from my hotel room before staging my "drowning."


First, my wedding ring. Three carats, princess cut."Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear." I stared at it, remembering the day Stefan had slid it onto my finger, Rose watching with that secret smile I'd been too blind to understand.


"Your marriage," Victoria observed. "Your first major loss."


I dropped the ring into the box. The sound it made hitting the bottom was strangely final.


Next, the charm bracelet my parents had given me for my sixteenth birthday. Each charm representing some achievement of mine they'd actually noticed.So few compared to Rose's overflowing trophy shelf.


"Your family," Victoria said. "Your deepest wound."


The bracelet joined the ring.


A small stack of photos came next. Me as a child,before Rose came. The last pictures of when I was enough all by myself. Me at my wedding, smiling so hopefully. A family Christmas, all of us posed perfectly for a card no one would remember receiving.


"Your illusions," Victoria noted. "The stories you told yourself to survive."


The photos fluttered into the box like fallen leaves.


Last was my wallet. Inside, my driver's license, credit cards, social security card. The official records of Camille Lewis.



"Your identity," Victoria whispered. "Who they told you to be."


These too went intothe chest. I stood empty-handed now, strange lightness spreading through me.


Victoria produced a- small silver key. "Are you certain? Once locked, this chest will be buried here,beside Sophia. Camille Lewis will rest here forever."


Was I certain? The question echoed in my mind. To lock away not just mementos, but the person l'd been for twenty-five years. The good sister. The loyal daughter. The loving wife. The woman who always forgave, always understood, always gave second chances.



But what had that earned me? Betrayal. Heartbreak.A sister who orchestrated my humiliation. A husband who discarded me on our anniversary. Parents who always loved their chosen daughter more.


"Yes," I said, surprising myself with the steadiness of my voice. "I'm certain."


Victoria inserted the key, turning it with a soft click.Then she knelt, placing the chest in a small hole already dug beside Sophia's headstone.


"Andrew," she called.


A man in a dark suit stepped forward from the tree line where he'd been waiting. I hadn't even noticed him. He carried a shovel and began covering the box with earth, each thud of dirt making the separation more final.


"In burying Camille Lewis beside my daughter,"
Victoria said, watching the box disappear, "we honor both lives cut short by betrayal. Sophia by her fiancé's family. You by those who should have treasured you."



When the last of the dirt was patted smooth and leaves scattered over it to hide the freshly turned earth, Victoria stood tall beside me. Together, we looked down at where pieces of my past now lay buried.



"Now Camille Lewis can truly rest," Victoria said,"and Camille Kane can rise without anything holding her back."



I expected to feel grief, or fear, or perhaps regret.Instead, strange calm washed over me.


"When do we begin?" | asked, turning from the grave to face my new reality.


Victoria's smile held approval. "We already have.Your education starts today. Finance, business strategy,social dynamics. Every weapon you'll need."
She handed me her phone, open to a news article.The headline read: "Lewis Family Holds Memorial Service for Daughter Believed Drowned."


There was a photo, Rose in tasteful black, eyes dramatically red, clutching Stefan's arm. My parents looking appropriately devastated. All positioned perfectly for the cameras.


"The first lesson," Victoria said, watching my reaction closely, "is learning to recognize performance.See how she tilts her head to catch the light? How her hand grips his arm, not for support, but possession?How even in grief, she's aware of the camera angles?"


I studied the photo with new eyes, seeing beyond my initial reaction. "She's enjoying it," I realized. "The attention. The sympathy. She's the star now."


"Precisely. And your parents? Notice their posture,the distance between them. Your father's hand not quite touching your mother's back. What does that tell you?"
I looked closer. "They're distant. Going through motions. Maybe... blaming each other?"


Victoria nodded, pleased. "Grief fractures weak foundations. Their perfect family image is cracking already. By the time we're finished, it will be dust."


She took back her phone, sliding it into her pocket."Come. We have a meeting with your teachers at noon. Your first public appearance as my daughter."


As we walked back toward the car, I glanced once more at the twin graves, one marked, one secret.Sophia Elizabeth Kane and Camille Elizabeth Lewis.Both women destroyed by people who should have protected them.


But from those ashes, something new was being formed. Something that wouldn't break so easily.


I straightened my shoulders, feeling strength I hadn't known I possessed.


"Happy birthday, Camille Kane," Victoria said as the driver opened our car door. "The world awaits."

I smiled, feeling the expression settle strangely on my face. Not the smile of the woman I'd been,eager to please, desperate for approval. But something sharper.More dangerous.


"It won't know what hit it," I promised, sliding into the cool leather interior.


As we drove away, I didn't look back at the graves.The past was buried now. Dead and gone.


All that remained was the future. And the reckoning it would bring.
###Chapter 11


CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW


"Stanford University, class of 2016. Summa cum laude. Double major in Economics and Computer Science."



I stared at the diploma in my hands, the heavy paper embossed with gold seals and signatures. My name,Camille Kane written in elegant calligraphy across the center. A degree I never earned from a university I'd never attended.



"How is this possible?" | asked, running my finger over the raised seal. It felt real. Everything felt real.


Victoria sat across from me in her private office,walls lined with dark wood and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. A massive desk separated us, covered with documents spread out like puzzle pieces forming my new life.


"Money opens many doors," she said, sliding another folder toward me. "People are surprisingly willing to alter records when the price is right. The right donation to the alumni fund, the right conversation with the right dean."


I opened the folder to find transcripts, teacher evaluations, even photos of "me" at graduation. The woman in the pictures looked like me, but with subtle differences, straightened hair, confident posture,designer clothes I'd never owned.


"That's not me," I whispered, touching the smiling graduate's face.


"Digital manipulation. Quite good, isn't it? We had an expert blend your features with photos of a real Stanford graduate. Just enough to pass as you if no one looks too closely."


I moved to the next document. Harvard Business School acceptance letter, followed by more transcripts, more doctored photos.
"MBA with focus on venture capital and emerging markets," Victoria continued, watching me closely."You were quiet but brilliant. Professors remember you as intensely private but insightful."


"And these professors will confirm this if asked?"


Victoria's smile was thin. "They already have. Three different background checks from various business publications have contacted them. All received the same carefully constructed memories of the remarkable but reserved Camille Kane."



My head spun. The depth of the deception was staggering. An entire life constructed from nothing,solid enough to withstand scrutiny.③


"What about before college? High school?Childhood?"





Victoria handed me another folder, thicker than the others. "Your entire history. Private schooling in Switzerland. Before that, exclusive boarding schools to shield you from media attention after | adopted you at age ten. Your biological parents, distant relations of mine died in a yacht accident off the coast of Monaco."


The folder contained school records, newspaper clippings of the accident, adoption papers dated fifteen years ago. Photos of a young girl who resembled me but wasn't quite right another digital creation.



"The backstory explains your absence from public life," Victoria said. "You were my closely guarded secret, educated abroad to protect you from those who might exploit our connection. It also explains why you're only now stepping into the spotlight as my heir."


I closed the folder, suddenly needing air. The weight of this new identity pressed down, both gift and burden. Freedom and cage.


"There's more," Victoria said, gesturing to the remaining files. "Medical records. Tax filings.Property deeds for apartments in New York and Paris you've supposedly owned for years. Even a driving record with a speeding ticket from 2018."
"The speeding ticket?"


"Authenticity requires imperfection. A life too clean raises questions."


I stood, moving to the window overlooking Manhattan. Sixty floors below, people scurried like ants, unaware of the fiction being written in this room. A fiction that would soon become my reality.


"Social media?" | asked, knowing the answer already.


"Carefully curated accounts dating back eight years.Limited posts, tasteful photos from global locations,the exact digital footprint one would expect from a private heiress. Our team has been building them slowly, posting backdated content on secure servers."



I turned back to her. "And what about the real me?Camille Lewis? What happens to her records, her accounts, her life?"


Victoria's face softened, just slightly. "Already managed. Your college records show an unremarkable student who never graduated. Your employment history reflects a series of administrative jobs with long gaps between. Your medical files now include notes about depression and instability."


A bitter taste filled my mouth. "Making my suicide more believable."


"Precisely." Victoria was unapologetic. "The more your disappearance aligns with expectations, the less anyone will question it."


She pressed a button on her desk phone. "Send in James with the final packet."


Moments later, a tall man in a dark suit entered carrying a sleek laptop and several files. He nodded respectfully before sefting them on the desk.


"The surveillance report, Ms. Kane," he said to Victoria. "And the social media monitoring as requested."


"Thank you, James. That will be all."
He departed silently, closing the heavy door behind him.



Victoria opened one of the files, considering its contents before looking up at me. "Are you ready for this?"



"Ready for what?"


"To see what your sister and ex-husband have been doing since your... departure."


My stomach tightened. Part of me wanted to say no,to preserve the numbness I'd carefully cultivated since burying my old life at the cemetery. But the stronger part, the part Victoria was nurturing,needed to see.



"Show me."



She handed me the file. Inside were surveillance photos, dozens of them, crisp and professional.Rose and Stefan walking hand-in-hand through an airport.Rose and Stefan dining at a rooftop restaurant. Rose wearing a white sundress on a beach, Stefan kissing her beneath an umbrella.


"Their romantic getaway," Victoria explained unnecessarily. "Santorini. They left three days after your memorial service."


I stared at the images, waiting for pain that didn't come. Instead, a cold clarity washed over me. They looked happy. Carefree. Unburdened by the woman they'd discarded.



"They didn't even wait a month," I said, my voice strange to mny own ears.


"Grief has its own timeline," Victoria replied, her tone making it clear what she thought of their mourning period.


More photos showed them shopping, swimming,posing for selfies with the blue Mediterranean behind them. In each one, Rose looked triumphant. The victor who'd finally claimed her prize.


"There's more," Victoria said, opening the laptop.

"Social media monitoring."
The screen showed Rose's Instagram account, newly updated with she and Stefan photos. The caption beneath a sunset picture read: "Finding joy again after unimaginable loss. Camille would have wanted us to be happy. #NewBeginnings #LoveWins"


A laugh escapoed me, harsh and unfamiliar. "She's using my 'death' for likes."


"Your father commented," Victoria noted, scrolling down. "'So happy you've found comfort in each other. Camille is watching over you both."


The room seemed to tilt sideways. My parents. The ones who should have questioned everything. Who should have demanded justice, investigation,answers. Instead, they were blessing this union built on betrayal.


"Keep scrolling," I said, needing to see it all, to burn it into my memory:
###Chapter 12

Camille's point of view

Rose had posted a "tribute" to me, a carefully filtered photo of us as teenagers, her arm around my shoulders, her face glowing while mine was partly in shadow. "Missing my angel sister every day. Your light was too bright for this world. #SisterLove #Forever"

Beneath it, dozens of sympathetic comments. Friends who'd never questioned her role in my marriage's end. Acquaintances eager to attach themselves to her grief narrative.

And Stefan, commenting with a simple heart emoji. The man who'd handed me divorce papers on our anniversary,now publicly mourning the wife he'd discarded.

"Enough," I said finally, closing the laptop. "I've seen what I needed to see."

Victoria studied me carefully. "And what do you feel?"

I searched myself, digging for the hurt, the rage, the betrayal that should be there. Instead, I found something colder, more focused. Like looking at specimens in a lab.

"Nothing," I answered honestly. "They're strangers performing in a play."

Victoria's smile was approving. "Good. Emotional detachment is essential for what comes next."

She gestured to the rest of the files on her desk. "Your new life awaits, Camille. Elite education. Investment prodigy. My reclusive adopted daughter finally emerging to take her place in my empire."

I picked up my new passport, thumb brushing over the name embossed in gold. Camille Kane. A woman who'd never been hurt by Rose. Never been betrayed by Stefan. Never been overlooked by parents who preferred their adopted daughter.

"And if someone recognizes me? Someone who knew Camille Lewis?"
Victoria's expression turned serious. "Your new life must be impenetrable. If anyone connects Camille Kane to Camille Lewis, everything we've built collapses."

"How do we prevent that?"

"First, appearance." She gestured to my hair. "Tomorrow morning, our stylists will transform you. New cut,new color, subtle changes that create distance from your former self."

I touched my long brown waves, another piece of the old me about to disappear."What else?"

"Body language.Speech patterns. The way you walk, the way you hold a glass, the way you respond to questions. We've arranged sessions with a behavioral coach who works with intelligence agencies. He'll help eliminate tells that might connect you to your former self."

The thoroughness of the plan was both impressive and terrifying. Victoria had thought of everything,anticipated every potential crack in my new identity.

"And most importantly," she continued, "limited exposure/to anyone who knew CCamille Lewis. For at least the first year, you'll avoid any setting where you might encounter old connections."

"And after that?"

Victoria's eyes gleamed. "After that, when your new identity is firmly established, when the world has accepted Camille Kane without question, then we begin the real work."

She opened anotherfile, this one containing financial reports, business plans, investment portfolios.

"Rose has expanded her boutique into a small fashion line. She's seeking five million in startup capital.Her current business plan is remarkably solid, I must admit."

I glanced at the numbers, the projections, seeing the dream my sister had likely been nurturing even while pretending to support my marriage,"And?"

"And Kane Ventures will be very interested in her proposal. So interested that I'm sending my protégée,you... to handle the potential investment personally."

The image formed in my mind instantly. Mle, transformed, powerful, wealthy beyond imagination sitting across from Rose, holding her dreams in my hands. Her not recognizing the sister she'd betrayed, now positioned to grant or destroy her future.

"How long?" I asked. "How long until I can face her as Camille Kane?"

"One year. Perhaps eighteen months. Time for your 'death' to fade from memory. Time for your new identity to solidify. Time for you to master every skill you'll need to dismantle their world piece by piece."

I nodded, a plan forming. Not just revenge, but justice. Not just destruction, but reconstruction. Taking back everything they'd stolen from me and more.

Victoria handed me a final document, a schedule that spanned months, detailing my transformation from Camille Lewis to Camille Kane. Language lessons. Etiquette training. Finance courses. Self-defense classes.Public speaking workshops. A complete rebuilding from the ground up.

"It begins tomorrow," she said. "5 AM. Personal trainer. 7 AM. Hair and styling. 9 AM. Diction coach. 11 AM.Press conference preparation. 2 PM. Official introduction to the board of Kane Industries."

The day stretched before me, the first of many that would forge me into someone new. Someone stronger.Someone capable of executing the justice I deserved.

Victoria opened her desk drawer and withdrew a small velvet box. "One last thing."

Inside was a pendant, a silver phoenix rising from flames, suspended on a platinum chain. Diamonds formed the bird's wings, catching light as she held it up.

"My gift to you. A reminder of what you're becoming."

She moved behind me, fastening the necklace around my throat. The pendant settled against my skin, cool at first, then warming.

"From the ashes of what they did to you," she murmured, her hands resting briefly on my shoulders. "From the fire they thought would destroy you."

I touched the phoenix, feeling its weight against my collarbone."Thank you."

Victoria returned to her desk, gathering the files into neat stacks. "Everything is in place. Your new identity,across from Rose, holding her dreams in my hands. Her not recognizing the sister she'd betrayed, now positioned to grant or destroy her future.

"How long?" I asked. "How long until I can face her as Camille Kane?"

"One year. Perhaps eighteen months. Time for your 'death' to fade from memory. Time for your new identity to solidify. Time for you to master every skill you'll need to dismantle their world piece by piece."

I nodded, a plan forming. Not just revenge, but justice. Not just destruction, but reconstruction. Taking back everything they'd stolen from me and more.

The day stretched before me, the first of many that would forge me into someone new. Someone stronger.Someone capable of executing the justice I deserved.

Victoria opened her desk drawer and withdrew a small velvet box. "One last thing."

Inside was a pendant, a silver phoenix rising from flames, suspended on a platinum chain. Diamonds formed the bird's wings, catching light as she held it up.

"My gift to you. A reminder of what you're becoming."

I touched the phoenix, feeling its weight against my collarbone."Thank you."

Victoria returned to her desk, gathering the files into neat stacks. "Everything is in place. Your new identity,your education, your backstory. Now we need only set the pieces in motion."

She pressed another button on her phone. "Send in the surveillance team."

Moments later, three men entered the office. James, who I'd seen earlier,and two others in similar dark suits.They carried tablets and folders, standing at attention until Victoria nodded for them to approach.

"Updates," she commanded.

"Ms. Lewis and Mr. Rodriguez returned from Greece this morning," James reported, handing her his tablet.

"And the parents?" Victoria asked.

"The Lewises are maintaining appearances," another man reported. "Charity functions, social obligations.Mrs.Lewis has increased her anxiety medication. Mr. Lewis has been spending more time at his club than at home."

Small cracks in their perfect facade. Just the beginning.

"Financial status?" Victoria directed this question to the third man.

"Lewis Industries stock has dropped eight percent since the memorial service. Initial sympathy has faded,and investors are questioning Mr. Lewis's focus. The Rodriguez family business remains stable, though there are rumors of tension between Stefan and his father regarding the hasty relationship to Rose."

Victoria nodded, satisfied. "Continue monitoring. I want updates daily. Focus particularly on Rose's business activities. Every investor she approaches, every meeting she takes."

"Yes,Ms.Kane."

They departed as silently as they'd arrived, leaving me alone again with Victoria and the scattered remnants of my fabricated life.

"Well?" she asked, studying my reaction.Does this satisfy you? Knowing they're being watched? Knowing we see every move they make?"

I considered the question, searching my feelings. The photos should have hurt. The news of them in Greece should have enraged me. Instead, I felt strangely detached, as if watching characters in a film I'd already seen.

"No," I answered honestly. "It doesn't satisfy me."

Victoria raised an eyebrow."NO?"

"Watching isn't enough. Knowledge isn't enough." I picked up the photo of Rose and Stefan on their vacation, her face glowing with triumph, his arm possessively around her waist. "They're happy.They believe they've won."

I set the photo down, turning it face-down on the desk. "I don't want repoorts about their lives. I want control over their lives. I want them to build dreams I can shatter. Create hopes I can destroy. Construct a future l can dismantle."

Victoria's smile spread slowly, pride evident in her eyes.nd you shall have that opportunity. But first,you must become someone they would never suspect. Someone they would trust with their aspirations."

l looked at the stack of documents that created Camille Kane, the foundation of my new existence. "When do we begin dismantling their happiness?"

"The moment you're ready," Victoria promised. "The moment Camille Kane is real enough, solid enough to withstand their scrutiny."

She gathered the surveillance photos, sliding them into a folder. "For now, focus on becoming. On shedding the last traces of the woman they hurt. On building the woman who will destroy them."

I nodded, understanding the path before me. A long game. A patient revenge. Not the quick satisfaction.of confrontation, but the deeper pleasure of orchestrated downfall.

"Tomorrow," I said, gathering my new identity papers. "We begin tomorrow."

Standing straighter, I faced Victoria with new determination."I'm ready."

She nodded once, satisfaction evident in her eyes. "Then let us begin."
###Chapter 13

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW the

"Hold still,please."

Dr. Miranda Torres's gloved fingers touched my chin, turning my face gently to catch the light. Her dark eyes studied every curve and angle with the focus of an artist examining marble before the first chisel strike.

We sat in her private clinic, a discreet facility hidden behind unmarked doors in a luxury Manhattan building.The consultation room looked more like an upscale spa than a medical office, with soft lighting, expensive artwork, and not a single diploma on display. The credentials were understood, not advertised. Dr. Torres didn't need wall decorations to prove her expertise, her client list of celebrities, politicians, and billionaires spoke for itself.

"Forgive my directness," she said, releasing my face and sitting back, "but you have excellent bone structure. We won't need to do nearly as much as l initially thought."

I glanced at Victoria, who sat in a leather chair in the corner, tablet in hand, seemingly absorbed in emails but missing nothing.

"What exactly will you be doing?" | asked, trying to keep the nervousness from .my voice.

Dr. Torres touched a screen on her desk, and a 3D model of my face appeared on the wall display.I stared at the digital version of myself, the me I'd been living with for the past five weeks of Victoria's transformation program.

"We're not planning a complete overhaul," Dr. Torres explained, manipulating the image with practiced gestures. "Thát would be obvious, unnatural, and frankly, unnecessary. Instead, we'll make strategic enhancements that build on your natural features while altering just enough to create distance from your former appearance.
The image on screen changed subtly as she spoke, small adjustments appearing and then reverting as she demonstrated possibilities.

"Your cheekbones, for instance," she continued. "Already well-defined, but we can enhance them slightly to create more dramatic shadows." The digital face shifted, the cheeks becoming more sculpted. "It changes how light hits your face, how others perceive your strength."

Victoria finally looked up. "Show the jaw adjustment as well."

Dr. Torres nodded, manipulating the image again. My jawline became slightly more defined, stronger.

"The goal isn't disguise," the doctor said, eyes meeting mine directly. "It's transformation. We're not erasing you, we're amplifying your power. People see what they expect to see, and no one looking for a victim will recognize a queen."

The words hit something deep inside me. No one looking for a victim will recognize a queen. Wasn't that exactly what Victoria had been teaching mne these past weeks? That power came not just fromn wealth or position, but from how you carried yourself,how others perceived you?

"What about recovery time?" I asked, surprising myself with how clinical my own voice sounded. When had I started accepting this as necessary rather than extreme?

"Two weeks for the initial healing. Six weeks before you're camera-ready for close-ups. We'll use minimally invasive techniques, fillers, fat transfers, thread lifts, and only minor surgical interventions."

She turned back to the display, continuing her overview. "Subtle refinement of the nose bridge.Enhancement of the lips, not overfilled, just a slight increase in definition. Brow lift to open the eyes. And we'll adjust the hairline slightly."

I watched my digital face transform bit by bit. Each change was small, almnost imperceptible on its own.Together, they created someone new, someone who looked like me but somehow...more. Stronger. Sharper.A face that commanded attention rather than sought approval.

"When can you begin?" Victoria asked, setting aside her tablet.

Dr. Torres checked her calendar. "I've already cleared my schedule for tomorrow morning. Assuming blood work comes back normal today, we can proceed at 7 AM."

Tomorrow. So soon. My heart rate increased, a flicker of panic rising in my chest. This was happening. Really happening. Not just new clothes or a different hairstyle, but physical changes to my very face.

Victoria must have noticed my reaction. "Do you need more time to consider?" Her tone was neutral, but l recognized the test beneath the question. Was I still committed? Still willing to do whatever necessary to become Camille Kane completely?

I met her gaze steadily. "No. Tomorrow is fine."

Dr. Torres nodded, pleased. "Excellent. My nurse will draw blood now, and I'll provide detailed pre-operative instructions. No food after midnight, no alcohol for 24 hours before, no aspirin or anti-inflammatories for a week."

She rose from her chair, signaling the consultation was ending. "One more thing, Ms. Kane," she added,using my new name with practiced ease. "This transformation is as much psychological as physical. The woman you'll see in the mirror afterward will look different, yes, but how you carry her, how you embody her,that's what truly changes how the world sees you."

After blood draws and paperwork, James drove us back to Victoria's mansion in silence. I stared out the window at passing Manhattan streets, trying to memorize my own face in the reflection. By this time tomorrow, it would be altered in ways I couldn't fully grasp yet.

"You're quiet," Victoria observed as we pulled into the private drive.

"Just thinking."

"Having doubts?"

I turned to look at her directly. "Would you stop the procedures if I said yes?"

A hint of a smile touched her lips. "No. But your answer tells me I won't need to force the issue."

As always, she saw through me with unsettling clarity. I wasn't having doubts, not really. Just trying to process the finality of what was happening. Every step until now had been theoretically reversible. Different clothes could be changed. Hair could grow back. Even my new name existed only on paper.

But altering my face, that was permanent. A physical manifestation of my commitment to this new life, this new identity.

"Dr. Torres is the best," Victoria said as we entered the house. "She's discreet, skilled, and understands our objectives completely. She's also the only surgeon who has ever worked on my face."

This surprised me. Victoria looked naturally elegant, her age visible but beautifully managed. I'd never suspected cosmetic intervention.

"You've had work done?" | asked before I could stop myself.

She raised one perfect eyebrow. "Of course. Beauty is a weapon, Camille. Only fools refuse to sharpen their blades due to misplaced principles."

That night, I stood before my bathroom mirror longer than usual, studying the face that would change tomorrow. I traced my cheekbones, the line of my jaw, the curve of my lips. Features inherited from parents who had chosen Rose over me again and again. Features Stefan had once claimed to love before discarding me for my sister.

Would changing my outside help heal what was broken inside?

Sleep came fitfully, filled with dreams of faceless women and mirrors that showed strangers. I woke before my alarm, stomach tight with a mix of anxiety and anticipation.

James drove me to the clinic in pre-dawn darkness. Victoria didn't accompany us this time, a board meeting required her attention. But her absence felt deliberate, another test to see if I would proceed without her oversight.

Dr. Torres greeted me in surgical scrubs, her manner calm and confident."A∥Iyour labs look excellent.We're right on schedule."

The next few hours passed in a haze of medications and murmured voices. I remembered the cool feel of antiseptic on my skin, the gentle pressure of Dr. Torres's hands marking surgical guidelines, the strange floating sensation as anesthesia pulled me under.
Then nothing.

I woke to dimmed lights and the soft beep of monitoring equipment. My face felt tight, pressure bandages wrapped around my head. A private nurse appeared immediately, offering ice chips for my dry throat.

"Everything went perfectly," she assured me in hushed tones. "Dr. Torres will be in shortly to check on you."

Time blurred. Dr. Torres appeared, checked vital signs, examined something beneath the bandages I couldn't see. "Excellent initial results," she said, sounding pleased. "We'll keep you overnight for monitoring,then move you to the recovery suite tomorrow."

The recovery suite turned out to be a luxury apartment attached to the clinic, staffed with private nurses and equipped with everything needed for healing in complete comfort and secrecy. Victoria had arranged for my things to be brought from the mansion-clothes, toiletries, even books I'd been reading.

For five days, I existed in a twilight state of medications, gentle care, and gradually reducing bandages. Dr.Torres visited twice daily, monitoring my healing with meticulous attention. Special diets arrived on silver trays. Nurses applied cooling masks and healing serums. Private physical therapists performed gentle facial massage to reduce swelling.

I still hadn't seen myself.

The mirrors had been covered when I arrived at the recovery suite, standard protocol, Dr. Torres explained,to prevent psychological shock during the most swollen phase of recovery.

On the sixth day, Dr. Torres arrived for her morning check with Victoria in tow. Something in their expressions told me today was significant.

"The initial healing has progressed exceptionally well," Dr. Torres said, examining my face with clinical precision. "The swelling has reduced enough for a first look. Are you ready?"

My heart pounded as I nodded.
###Chapter 14

Camille's point of view

Victoria watched with unreadable eyes as Dr. Torres led me to the large bathroom. A white cloth covered the full-length mirror. The doctor positioned me carefully, standing slightly behind my right shoulder.

"Remember," she said gently, "what you seetoday is still healing. There's swelling, bruising. The final results won't be visible for weeks. But you'll get a first impression of your new appearance."

With that, she pulled away the cloth.

I gasped.

The woman in the mirror was me, but not me. My face but enhanced in ways that transformed my entire appearance. My cheekbones cast elegant shadows beneath them, giving my face a sculpted quality it had never possessed before. My jawline looked stronger, more defined. My brows arched slightly higher, making my eyes appear larger, more commanding.

Even through residual swelling and faint bruising, I could see the changes Dr. Torres had created. Subtle individually, powerful collectively. My lips had a new definition, not obviously augmented but somehow more present. My nose, always slightly crooked from a childhood fall, now had a perfect straight bridge.

I raised a hand to my face, watching my reflection do the same. The stranger in the mirror touched her cheek wit trembling fingers.

"What do you think?" Dr. Torres asked quietly.

Words failed me. This new face looked... strong. Confident. The kind of face that belonged on magazine covers or in boardrooms. The kind of face people remembered.

"It's..." I swallowNed hard. "I hardly recognize myself."
"That's partly the swelling," Dr. Torres assured me. "And partly the shock of change. Your brain needs time to adjust to the new image. In a few weeks, this will feel like you. The real you."

But which me was real? The woman I'd been before, or this new creation designed for power?

Victoria stepped forward, studying my reflection with critical eyes. Then, something rare happened, she smiled.A genuine expression of approval that transformed her usually stern face.

"Perfect," she said simply. "Exactly what we needed."

Something warm bloomed in my chest at her approval, a feeling I immediately tried to suppress. I shouldn't crave her validation this way, Shouldn't feel this rush of pleasure at her acceptance. Yet I did.

Dr. Torres detailed the continuing care routine, medications, specialized skincare, follow-up appointments.I listened with half an ear, still captivated by the stranger in the mirror who now wore my expressions.

Later, after Victoria and Dr. Torres had gone, I sat alone in the recovery suite, lights dimmed as evening fell.Every few minutes, I found myself reaching for the small hand mirror beside my bed, checking to see if the face I'd seen earlier was still there. Still mine.

Each time, those new eyes looked back at me, harder, sharper, more penetrating than the eyes I'd known all my life. Eyes that no longer pleaded for love or acceptance. Eyes that demanded respect.

As night deepened, exhaustion finally pulled me toward sleep. But as consciousness faded,images began forming in the darkness behind my eyelids. Dreams taking shape, vivid and disturbing.

I stood on a bridge, rain pouring down around me. Below, dark water churned angrily. Across from me stood Rose,her perfect face contorted with fear. Between us, a broken railing gaped like an open mouth.

"Please," Rose begged, backing away from me. "Camille, please, it wasn't supposed to happen like this!"

In the dream, I moved toward her, my new face reflected in her terrified eyes. She kept retreating until her back hit the damaged railing. It creaked ominously.

"You took everything from me,"dream-me said, voice cold as the rain drenching us both. "MMy husband.My family.My life."
"I'm sorry!" Rose cried, genuine terror in her voice as the railing began giving way behind her. "P'll fix it! I'll make it right!"

But it was too late. The railing snapped. Rose screamed as she fell backward, hands grasping empty air.I watched her plummet toward the dark water below, her scream cutting off as she hit the surface and disappeared beneath the churning waves.

I should have felt horror. Should have rushed to the edge, called for help, tried to save her. Instead, dream-me smiled, satisfied, as Rose's hands broke the surface once, twice, then disappeared for good.

I woke with a gasp, heart racing, sheets tangled around my legs. The dream had felt so real, the rain on my skin, the sound of the railing breaking, Rose's scream as she fell. But what disturbed me most wasn't the dream itself.

It was how I felt about it.

I hadn't wanted to save my sister. I had wanted to watch her drown.⑪

The realization sent me stumbling to the bathroom, where I splashed cold water on my face, my new face,before looking up at my reflection in the mirror. In the harsh bathroom light, with water dripping from my chin, I barely recognized myself anymore.

Not just because of the surgical changes, the swelling, the bruises fading to yellow. Something in my eyes had changed too. Something harder, colder. Something that had watched Rose drown in my dream and felt nothing but satisfaction.

I backed away from the mirror, suddenly afraid of what I saw there. Not the physical changes, but the transformation happening inside. Was this who I was becoming? Someone who could dream of her own sister's death and feel pleasure rather than horror?

Sleep eluded me for the rest of the night. I sat by the window, watching city lights glitter inthe darkness,trying to untangle the knot of emotions inside me. By dawn, I'd reached no conclusions, just a dull acceptance that something fundamental was shifting within me. Something that might be necessary for what lay ahead, but frightening nonetheless.

Two more days passed in the recovery suite before Victoria declared it time to return to the mansion. The bruising had faded enough to be covered by makeup, the swelling reduced to subtle puffiness only I would notice.

As James drove us back, Victoria reviewed upcoming appointments on her tablet. "The board wants to officially announce you as my heir at next quarter's shareholders meeting. We'll need professional portraits before then. Dr. Torres suggests another three weeks before scheduling the photo session."

I nodded, only half-listening, still caught in thoughts of my disturbing dream.

"Your silence suggests either disinterest or distraction," Victoria observed, setting aside her tablet. "WVhich is it?"

I turned from the window to face her. "I had a dream about Rose. About watching her drown and... enjoying it."

I expected judgment, perhaps even concern about my psychological state. Instead, Victoria's expression remained neutral, assessing.

"And this troubles you?"

"Shouldn't it?" | asked. "She's still my sister."

"Is she?" Victoria's question hung in the air between us. "The woman who orchestrated your husband's betrayal? Who manipulated your parents against you for years? Who celebrated while the world thought you dead? Does sharing blood with such a person obligate you to forgiveness?"①

Put that way, it sounded rational, even obvious. But something still twisted uncomfortably in my stomach.

"It's not about forgiveness," I said slowly. "It's about who I'm becoming. The person in that dream, the one who smiled while watching her sister drown, I didn't recognize her."

Victoria studied me for a long moment before responding. "Transformation isn't just physical, Camille. Your face changes, yes, but so does your heart. Your mind. Your soul, if you believe in such things."

She gestured to my altered features. "What Dr. Torres did was merely the external manifestation of an internal process already underway. The woman who can dismantle Rose's world cannot be the same woman Rose once destroyed."

The car pulled into the mansion's driveway, gravel crunching beneath the tires. Victoria gathered her things,preparing to exit, but paused before opening her door.

"Your dream doesn't show corruptioshe said, her voice unexpectedly gentle. "It shows preparation. Your mind is readying itself for what your heart still resists."

With that, she stepped from the car,leaving me to follow when ready.

That night, in my suite at the mansion, I stood before the full-length mirror in my bathroom, lights bright enough to hide nothing. Unwrapped the soft bandage Dr. Torres had applied for sleeping. Studied every changed angle of my face with critical eyes.

The woman looking back at me seemed both familiar and foreign. I recognized the core of my features,the basic blueprint remained. But the enhancements had transformed me into someone who commanded attention rather than blended into backgrounds.Someone who looked like she belonged in Victoria's world of power and privilege.

I remembered Rose at my wedding, standing beside me in photos, somehow always managing to outshine the bride. Her subtle positioning to catch the best light, her practiced smile that photographers always loved. She'd spent a lifetime learning how to be seen, how to be the center of every frame.

Now I would learn the same. But for a different purpose.

Turning away from the mirror, I moved to my desk where files awaited review, Rose's growing fashion business, Stefan's latest projects, my parents' social calendar. Information gathered by Victoria's team,delivered daily to keep me informed of the lives continuing without me.

Rose's designs were good, better than I'd expected. She had genuine talent beneath the manipulative exterior. Her business plan showed surprising acumen. The investor meetings lined up for the coming months represented real opportunity for growth.

All of which would make it more satisfying when I eventually controlled whether she succeeded or failed.

The thought should have disturbed me. A month ago, it would have. Now, it felt like stepping into a role I was born to play.

I closed the files and returned to the mirror, studying my new face one more time. In the dream, Rose had looked into these eyes and seen something that terrified her. Soon, that dream would become reality.

"We're not erasing you," Dr. Torres had said. "We're amplifying your power."

She was right. The face looking back at me now wasn't a disguise. It was a revelation. The woman I might have become naturally, if life hadn't beaten me down for so many years. If Rose hadn't systematically undermined my confidence. If Stefan hadn't betrayed me. If my parents hadn't always preferred their adopted daughter.
###Chapter 15

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW

The fist came at my face too fast to dodge. I tried to block like Jason had taught me, but my arms felt heavy as stone. His knuckles grazed my cheek as I stumbled backward.

"Too slow," he barked. "Again."

My lungs burned. Swveat stung my eyes. We'd been at this for almost two hours, and the digital clock on the gym wall showed 5:47 AM. The sun wasn't even up yet.

Jason Winters stood opposite me on the training mat, barely breathing hard. His military haircut and scarred face gave nothing away, no tiredness, no frustration, just cold assessment. As Victoria's head of security,he'd protected presidents and royalty before becoming my combat instructor three weeks ago.

"|cant,"|gasped, hands on my knees. "Need water."

"Your sister won't give you water when she's destroying everything you love,"he said flatly."YOUrex-husband won't offer a break when he's laughing at your weakness."

The mention of Rose and Stefan sent fresh anger coursing through me. I straightened, raising my fists again.



Jason nodded once, approval flickering in his gray eyes."Channel it. Use it."

He circled me slowly. I tracked his movement, watching for tells we'd discussed yesterday, the slight shoulder drop before he jabbed, the weight shift before he kicked.

There, his right foot pivoted slightly. I ducked the punch that followed, slipping inside his guard like he'd demonstrated.My counter-strike hit his ribs, not hard enough to damage but enough to make him grunt.

"Better," he said, stepping back. "You're learning."
Those words were the closest thing to praise I'd received since this nightmare training began. Three weeks of waking at 4:30 AM for combat lessons with Jason, followed by business classes, language instruction,etiquette training, and endless other lessons designed to transform me from Camille Lewis into Camille Kane.

"Ten minute break," Jason said, checking his watch. "Then weapons training."

I collapsed onto a bench, grabbing my water bottle with shaking hands. My body felt like one massive bruise. Even my fingernails hurt.

In the mirrored wall opposite me, a stranger stared back. My once-long brown hair had been cut into a sleek bob and dyed a rich, darker shade. My face had thinned from the grueling exercise regiment and surgery,cheekbones now sharp enough to cut glass. Designer workout clothes clung to a body that had grown leaner,harder.

I barely recognized myself anymore. Which was exactly the point.

"Water won't restore your electrolytes," a crisp voice said from the doorway. Victoria stood there in her impeccable business suit, looking as though she'd been awake for hours. Perhaps she had.

She crossed to me, handing over a green smoothie in a steel tumbler.otein, vitamins, minerals. Drink it all."

The taste was awful-like liquified grass with a hint of metal-but I'd learned not to complain. Victoria didn't tolerate weakness, especially not from her "daughter."

"Jason reports improvement," she said, scrolling through messages on her phone. "Though yor defensive reactions remain inadequate."

"I've never fought before," I muttered, gulping the vile smoothie. "Three weeks ago, my biggest physical challenge was yoga twice a month."

Victoria's eyes,flicked up from her screen."And how did that serve you when Rose took everything? When Stefan discarded you? When those mnen attacked you in the parking garage?"

The memory of fists connecting with my ribs sent phantom pain through my body. I flinched.

 "Exactly," Victoria said, noting my reaction. "The world doesn't care about fair. It respects only strength and the willingness to use it."

She checked her watch, a discreet Patek Philippe that probably cost more than my parents' car. "Your meeting with Japanese investors is at nine. After that, corporate finance with Professor Whitman until noon.Lunch with the editor of Vanity Fair, she's profiling young female entrepreneurs and wants to include Camille Kane."

My stomach dropped. "A journalist? Already? But we've barely established my background. What if...."

"The groundwork is laid," Victoria cut me off. "Your Stanford and Harvard credentials have been verified by three separate media outlets. Your childhood in Swiss boarding schools explains your absence from American social circles. The timing is perfect, mysterious heiress emerges just as public interest peaks."

Jason returned, carrying a collection of wooden training knives. Victoria nodded to him and turned back to me.

"After lunch, language lessons with Madame Rousseau. Your French remains embarrassingly rudimentary for someone supposedly educated in Switzerland."

I bit back a retort. Arguing was pointless.

"Then etiquette with Mrs. Harrington from four to six. Dinner with the board members at seven." She handed me a tablet. "Their profiles. Memorize before tonight."

The screen showed faces and bios of twelve stern-looking executives, all men over fifty. More names,more details to absorb into my already overloaded brain.

"That's all for now," Victoria said, already turning toward the door. "Jason, focus on knife defense today. The weakness in her left side leaves her vulnerable."

After she left, Jason held out a hand to pull me up from the bench. If I expected gentleness after Victoria's demanding schedule, his grim expression crushed that hope.

"Knife attacks aren't like the movies," he said, demonstrating a slashing motion with the wooden trainer."They're fast, dirty, and usually from someone standing closer than you think."
By 6:30, I had six new bruises and a shallow cut on my forearm where I'd failed to block correctly. By 7:15,1could barely lift my arms to shower.

Staring at the tiles in the massive rainfall shower, I let hot water pound my aching muscles. The bathroom alone in my suite was bigger than my entire first apartment after college. Italian marble, gold fixtures, towels softer than clouds. Luxury surrounded me now, but it felt like a beautiful prison.

I dressed mechanically in the outfit laid out by my new personal stylist, a navy blue Chanel suit, cream silk blouse, and pearls that cost more than a car. My reflection looked polished, wealthy, untouchable.

Exactly as Victoria intended.

The car waited downstairs, James holding the door with his usual stoic expression. Since becoming Victoria's adopted daughter, I hadn't driven myself anywhere. Hadn't cooked a meal, made a bed, or even chosen my own clothes. Every aspect of my existence was managed, controlled, shaped.

"The investors are already at the office,"James informed me as we pulled into morning traffic. "Ms.Kane asks that you review the portfolio proposals during the drive."

Another folder, another stack of documents to memorize. I opened it to find prospectuses for three Japanese tech companies seeking American investment, filled with terms I barely understood three weeks ago.

I'forced myself to focus, absorbing facts and figures, trying to anticipate questions. Victoria would test me later-she always did, with that expectant look that made me feel simultaneously eager to please and resentful of theneed to do so.

By nine o'clock, I sat across from three Japanese businessmen in Victoria's sleek conference room,speaking confidently about market penetration and competitive advantage like I'd been doing it my whole life.Victoria watched from the head of the table, her face revealing nothing.

When we closed the deal an hour later, securing exclusive investment rights for less than the companies had initially asked, a flicker of approval crossed her face.

"Well done," she said after they left, the closest thing to praise she'd offered since our training began."Your preparation was evident."

The tiny scrap of acknowledgment shouldn't have meant so much, but I felt warmth bloom in my chest.
Then hated myself for craving her approval at all.

******

Professor Whitman arrived next, a stern Harvard economist who treated me like anignorant child despite my supposed MBA from his institution. For three hours, he grilled me on corporate finance structures until my head throbbed and equations swam before my eyes.

"Your grasp of leveraged buyouts remains superficial," he noted as he packed up, not bothering to hide his disappointment. "Review ###Chapters seven through twelve before tomorrow."

I nodded, though the thought of more studying after today's schedule made me want to scream.Or cry.Or both.

Lunch with the Vanity Fair editor was a special kind of torture. Maintaining my new identity while answering personal questions about a childhood that never happened required constant vigilance.

"So what was it like, growing up as Victoria Kane's secret daughter?" she asked, recorder running between our plates at the exclusive restaurant Victoria had chosen.

I gave the practiced answer, natural enough to sound genuine. "Private. Sheltered. Mom was always concerned about my safety, especially after what happened to her first family."

The editor leaned forward eagerly."Yes, the tragic accident that claimed her husband and son. You would have been, what, eight when that happened?"①

"Ten," I corrected smoothly, though in reality, I'd been thirteen when Victoria's family died, a fact I'd memorized from public records rather than personal experience. "Too young to fully understand, but old enough to see how it changed her."

"And being sent abroad afterward? That must have been difficult."

"She wanted me safe," I replied, the rehearsed explanation flowing naturally now. "The isolation was challenging, but it forged independence. Mother always says strength grows from discomfort."
The editor scribbled notes, clearly loving the narrative of the mysterious heiress emerging from seclusion.By the time lunch ended, she'd extracted enough quotes for a glowing profile that would further cement my new identity.

I checked my watch as her taxi pulled away. Twenty minutes to reach Madame Rousseau's language studio.Not enough time to rest. Never enough time.
###Chapter 16

Camille's point of view

By four o'clock, my brain felt stuffed with French conjugations and pronunciation corrections. My third coffee of the day wasn't helping the shaking in my hands.

Mrs. Harrington, the etiquette coach, noticed immediately. "A lady never allows fatigue to show," she reprimanded, straightening my already-straight spine. "Shoulders back. Chin parallel to the floor. Now, let's review the proper handling of difficult dinner conversations."

For two more hours, we practiced responding to inappropriate questions, managing awkward silences,and the subtle art of steering conversations toward or away from specific topics. All skills Victoria deemed essential for navigating the society events that would soon fill my calendar.

When James finally drove me back to the mansion at six, I had exactly forty-five minutes to prepare for dinner with the board members. My head pounded. Black spots danced at the edges of my vision. The thought of making small talk with twelve stern executives made me want to curl into a ball and disappear.

Instead,I changed into the evening dress laid out for me, an elegant black Dior that probably cost more than most people's monthly salary. The stylist had left detailed notes about which jewelry to wear and how to arrange my hair.

Looking in the mirror, I barely recognized the sophisticated woman staring back at me. Designer dress.Perfect makeup. Expensive jewelry. Ilooked like I belonged in Victoria's world of wealth and power.

But inside, I felt hollowed out. Empty. A pretty shell with nothing left inside.⑪

My knees buckled suddenly, room spinning around me. I grabbed thevanity for support, but my arms gave way.The last thing I saw before darkness claimed me was my reflection sliding sideways in the mirror, eyes closing as consciousness slipped away.
 I woke to softness beneath me and the sensation of something cool on my forehead. Opening my eyes slowly,I found myself on my bed, still in the black dress, though someone had removed my shoes.

"The third time this week," Victoria's voice came from nearby. "Your body is telling you something."

I turned my head to find her sitting in a chair beside my bed, reading glasses perched on her nose as she reviewed documents. She didn't look up.

"What time is it?" I croaked, throat dry.

"Nearly nine. James found you when you didn't come down for the car." She made a note in the margin of whatever she was reading. "I sent your regrets to the board.We'll reschedule."

Shame washed over me. "I'm sorry."

Victoria finally looked up, removing her glasses. "For what? Having physical limitations? That's not failure,it's biology."

I struggled to sit up, room tilting dangerously before settling. "The dinner was important."

"Yes. And you were in no condition to attend." She set aside her papers. "Which raises a question about your training regimen."

My heart sank. More lessons? Earlier mornings? I couldn't imagine how my schedule could become more grueling than it already was.

"Why are you doing this to me?" The question slipped out before I could stop it, raw and honest in a way l hadn't allowed myself to be since accepting her offer.

Victoria didn't seem offended. If anything, she looked like she'd been expecting the question.

"Because no one becomes powerful by being comfortable," she said, her voice matter-of-fact."Not even my own daughter."

She stood, moving to the window that overlooked the mansion's gardens, silver hair gleaming in the moonlight filtering through the glass.
"When I was twenty-two,"she continued,"|worked three jobs while attending night classes.I slept four hours a night for two years. Collapsed twice from exhaustion. Kept going anyway."

She turned back to face me. "By twenty five, I'd built my first company. By thirty, my first billion. Each step required sacrifice. Comfort and power rarely coexist."

"But this pace isn't sustainable," I protested. "I can't keep..."

"Of course you can't," she interrupted. "That's precisely the point."

I stared at her, confused.

"Pushing beyond your limits shows you where they truly lishe explained. "Most people never discover their actual capacity boecause they stop at the first sign of discomfort."

She returned to the chair beside my bed. "The training you've endured these past weeks has taught you more than facts and skills. It's shown you that you're capable of far more than you believed."

I considered her words, realizing with surprise that she was right. Three weeks ago, I couldn't have imagined absorbing so much information, enduring such physical challenges, maintaining a completely new identity under pressure.

"But now adjustments are necessary,".Victoria continued."We've established your baseline. From tomorrow,your schedule will change."

Relief flooded through me. "Fewer lessons?"

"Different distribution," she corrected. "Combat training three days a week instead of five. Business education condensed into more efficient modules. More independent study, less classroom time."

She handed me a glass of water from the bedside table. "Your body needs recovery time to strengthen.Your mind needs space to process. Neither benefits from constant pressure without relief."

I sipped the water, studying her over the rim of the glass. "You knew this would happen. The collapse."

"I anticipated it," she acknowledged. "Just as I anticipate your ability to adapt to what comes next."
"Which is?"

"Phase two." Victoria smiled slightly. "The foundation is laid, basic skills, public introduction, established background.Now we build your reputation, your connections, your influence."

She stood again, smoothing her impeccable suit. "Sleep now. Tomorrow starts later, 9 AM meeting with your new personal physician. He'll assess your physical condition and recommend adjustments to your training."

It felt like a massive concession coming from her. But as she reached the door, she paused, looking back with steel in her eyes.

"Don't mistake this for softness, Camille. The path ahead remains difficult. But breaking you serves no purpose. I need you strong, capable, and fully functional."

"For revenge," I said quietly.

"For justice," she corrected. "And for the future neither of us could have achieved alone."

After she left, I stared at the ceiling, too exhausted to undress but too wired to sleep immediately. Her words echoed in my mind: No one becomes powerful by being comfortable. Not even my own daughter.

The endearment felt strange, both false and oddly genuine. I wasn't her daughter, not really. But I wasn't Camille Lewis anymore either. I existed in some in-between state, shedding my old self day by painful day,but not yet fully transformed into whoever I was becoming.

Rolling onto my side, I caught sight of my reflection in the dressing table mirror across the room. Even from here, I could see how different I looked from the woman who had signed divorce papers three weeks ago.Thinner.Sharper.Harder.②

Eventually, exhaustion won, pulling me under into dreams filled with fighting shadows and endless tests l couldn't pass. I woke periodically throughout the night, each time remembering Victoria's words before drifting off again.

No one becomes powerful by being comfortable.

By morning, something had shifted inside me. The resentment remained, but alongside it grew a different feeling, determination. If this brutal regimen was the price of becoming someone who could never be hurt like Camille Lewis had been, perhaps it was worth paying after all.

When my alarm sounded at 8 AM, practically mid-day compared to my usual wake-up, I rose without the bone-deep dread that had accompanied each morning for weeks. My body still ached, my mind still felt overloaded, but something else had grown stronger.

My resolve.

The woman in the mirror looked back at me with eyes that matched Victoria's in their determination, if not yet in their confidence. Not quite Camille Lewis anymore. Not fully Camille Kane yet.

But getting closer every day.

I showered, dressed in the outfit laid out for me, and headed downstairs where James would be waiting with the car. Each step still hurt, but now I welcomed the pain.

It meant I was changing.Growing.Becoming.
###Chapter 17

ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW

"Ms. Lewis, do you think the police should reopen the investigation into your sister's death?"

The reporter's question hit me like ice water as I stepped out of my boutique. Three months. Three months since Camille's car had been pulled from the river. Three months of playing the grieving sister while secretly celebrating my freedom. And still, these vultures wouldn't let it rest.

I arranged my face into the perfect mask of dignified grief I'd perfected. "My family continues to cooperate fully with authorities," I said, voice carefully modulated to show emotion without appearing unstable. "But we've accepted the official conclusion. Sometimes we must find peace without all the answers."

The reporter pressed closer, microphone extended. "Sources close to the investigation say no body was ever recovered. Some suggest the case should be treated as a missing person situation rather than a presumed drowning."

My heart skipped a beat, though my expression remained steady. "The current was exceptionally strong that night. The police explained this to us. Many drowning victims are never..." I let my voice catch deliberately,"...never found."

This performance was becoming tedious. I'd given the same answers at the memorial service, at charity events, at business functions. Always the grieving sister, bravely carrying on despite unimaginable loss. lt had worked beautifully at first-sympathy opening doors, sad smiles earning trust, tearful interviews generating publicity for my fashion line.

But lately, the questions had shifted. Where's the body? Why was she driving there that night? Was there a suicide note? Each one carrying the unspoken suggestion that things didn't add up.

"One last question-" the reporter started, but I cut him off with a raised hand.
"I'm late for a meeting with investors. Please respect my family's privacy during this difficult time."

My driver held the car door open, and I slid inside, dropping the sorrowful expression the moment the tinted windows shielded me from view. Tension coiled in my stomach like a snake. These questions were becoming problematic.

"The Lewis Industries offices," I instructed the driver, checking my makeup in a compact mirror. Perfect, as always. Not a crack in the facade.

I glanced at the news alert on my phone as I slid into the car.

The headline made my blood freeze.

**HEIRESS DROWNING: QUESTIONS REMAIN**

The article rehashed the basics, Camille's car found partially submerged, no witnesses, no body recovered despite extensive searching. But it also included quotes from a"source close to the investigation"suggesting the case had been closed prematurely due to pressure from unnamed powerful interests.

I closed the article with a flick of my finger. My father had probably seen it already. He monitored all news about the family obsessively since Camille's disappearance.

Of course he was. Daddy never could.handle pressure. Always looking to others to fix his problems, usually me, since Camille had been useless in a crisis. Just one more way I'd proven my value to the family that chose me.

The car pulled up to Lewis Industries, the gleaming tower that housed my father's company. The business he'd built from nothing, the empire that should have been mine from the beginning, if not for his sentimentality regarding his biological daughter.

The receptionist smiled as I entered the lobby. "Ms. Lewis, your father is expecting you."

The executive'elevator whisked me to thetop floor, where Dad's assistant ushered me straight into his office. He stood at the window, back to the door, shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit. He'd lost weight in the past three months, grief aging him visibly.
"Daddy," I said softly, closing the door behind me. "You wanted to see me?"

He turned, face haggard in ways makeup couldn't hide. None of the fake grief I'd perfected, but genuine suffering etched into every line. It was pathetic, really. All this pain for a daughter who had never appreciated what she had.

"Rose." He opened his arms, and I stepped into them, playing my part perfectly. The supportive daughter.The family's rock. "Have you seen the papers?"

"Just now. It's nothing,tabloid nonsense."

He released me, moving to his desk where several newspapers lay open. Not just the Post, but the Times the Journal. All running variations of the same story.

"The board is concerned," he said, sinking into his chair. "These rumors... the suggestion of impropriety...it's affecting investor confidence."

I perched on the edge of his desk, laying a comforting hand on his arm. "The police investigation was thorough. The case is closed. These are just reporters looking for a story where none exists."

"Your mother hired a private investigator."

The words hit me like a slap. "She what?"

Dad rubbed his temples, looking older by the minute. "Behind my back. Said she couldn't live with unanswered questions. Needed closure."

Panic fluttered in my.chest, but | kept my voce level. "That's unnecessary. And potentially damaging to the company if it suggests we don't trust the official investigation."

"That's what I told her!" His fist hit the desk, a rare display of temper. "But she won't listen. Ever since...since we lost Camille, she's been different. Distant. Suspicious."

Of me, he meant. Though he wouldn't say it aloud. Mom had always been more perceptive than him, more likely to see through my careful manipulations. She'd been watching me with narrowed eyes at family dinners,studying me when she thought I wasn't looking.
"P'H talk to her," I promised, mind already racing through potential problems. A private investigator meant questions. Digging.Potentially uncovering things better left buried.

Like the men I'd hired to scare Camille. The ones who were supposed to rough her up a bit, send a message, then disappear. Not force her car off a bridge. Not kill her.

That hadn't been the plan. Excessive, messy, and unnecessary. But what was done was done, and I'd adapted accordingly. Tragedy could be useful when properly managed.

"It's not just the investigation," Dad continued, looking miserable. "The memorial fund donations have raised questions too. That Times reporter asked for a breakdown of how the money's being used."

The Camille Lewis Memorial Fund, my masterstroke. Set up ostensibly to support mental health awareness,it had generated nearly two million in donations, much of which was currently financing my fashion line's expansion. All perfectly legal, with the right paperwork and the right accountants. But not something that would withstand intense scrutiny.

"I'll have the Foundation's accountants prepare a statement,"|said smoothly."Complete transparency will put these questions to rest."

Dad nodded, clearly relieved to have me handling things. Always so eager to believe the best of me. To see me as the good daughter, the responsible one. The worthy heir.

"There's one more thing," he said, hesitation in his voice. "Detective Ramirez called this morning. They found something downstream. A... a shoe. They think it might be Camille's."

My stomach dropped. "After three months in the water?"

"Caught in debris, apparently. They want us to identify it."

A shoe. Just a shoe. Not a body. Not evidence of anything except that my sister had been wearing footwear when her car went into the river. Still, it unsettled me. Physical evidence connecting Camille to the water.

"When?"

"Tomorrow morning." He looked away. "Would you go? Your mother can't handleit,and l..."
"Of course."|squeezed his hand, the dutiful daughter once more. "I'll handle everything."

I left his office with my mind churning. Too many loose threads. The newspaper articles. Mom's private investigator. Now this shoe. Small things individually, but together they formed a pattern I didn't like.Questions leading to more questions.Attention I didn't need.

My phone buzzed as I reached the lobby. A text from one of my investors, confirming our meeting tomorrow.I responded quickly, promising to bring the updated business projections.

As my car arrived, I couldn't help but feel irritation building. These questions about Camille's disappearance were becoming an unwelcome distraction from my business plans. The last thing I needed was police reopening the case and digging into details better left buried.

Details that only I knew. The men I'd hired to scare Camille that night. The plan that had gone terribly wrong when they forced her car off the bridge instead of just delivering a warning. A miscalculation I hadn't anticipated, but one I'd quickly adapted to use to my advantage.

The afternoon crawled by in a haze of meetings and phone calls. My fashion line was gaining traction,featured in Vogue last month, celebrities requesting custom pieces. Everything I'd worked for was falling into place.

Except these damned questions that wouldn't die.
###Chapter 18

Rose point in view

By evening, I was exhausted from maintaining the perfect balance of grieving sister and focused businesswoman. My driver took me to my parents' house for our weekly family dinner, a tradition I'd insisted on continuing "to help us heal together."

In reality, these dinners served to monitor my parents, manage the family narrative, and remind everyone of my central role in holding things together post-tragedy. Tonight, however, I dreaded facing Mom's suspicious eyes.

The house looked the same as always, manicured lawn, gleaming windows, tasteful luxury evident in every detail. The home I'd been brought to fourteen years ago, plucked from the foster system into privilege. The home where I'd systematically established my dominance over every aspect of family life.

Helen, the housekeeper, opened the door before I could ring the bell. "They're in the sitting room,Miss Rose. Your mother's had...a difficult day."

Mom was drinking again. Perfect. An inebriated mother was easier to manage than a suspicious one.

I found them exactly as expected-Dad with a financial report, pretending to work while actually hiding; Mom on her third martini, staring at nothing. The picture of a family fractured by loss.

"Evening," I said brightly, kissing each of their cheeks. "Helen's cooking smells amazing."

Mom looked up, eyes slightly unfocused. "You're late."

"Investor meeting ran long. Good news, though, we've secured funding for the international expansion."

Dad attempted a smile. "That's wonderful, princess. Your business acumen never ceases to amaze me."

"Camille's shoe," Mom said abruptly, the non sequitur hanging awkwardly in the air. "Richard told you?"
I nodded,settling into an armchair across from her. "Yes. I'm going to the station tomorrow to identify it."

"I should go." Her voice hardened. "I'm her mother."

"You're in no condition," Dad muttered, not looking up from his papers. "Rose will handle it."

Mom's laugh was bitter, cutting. "Rose handles everything, doesn't she? So capable. So composed. Never a hair out of place, even when discussing her sister's remains."

The accusation in her tone was unmistakable. I kept my expression neutral, concerned but steady."Mom,I know this is difficult. But falling apart won't bring Camille back. Someone needs to stay strong for this family."

"This family." She snorted, taking another sip of her drink. "What family? My daughter is dead. My husband buries himself in work rather than face his grief.And you..."

She trailed off, studying me with eyes suddenly sharper than her intoxication suggested.

"And I what?" |asked softly.

The moment stretched, tension crackling between us. For an instant, I thought she might actually say it, the suspicion I'd seen growing in her gaze over recent weeks. The doubt that had prompted her to hire a private investigator,

But Dad intervened, setting aside his papers with forced cheer. "Let's eat, shall we? No sense letting Helen's cooking go cold."

Dinner was excruciating, Mom alternating between silent glaring and pointed barbs, Dad attempting desperately to maintain normal conversation, me navigating the minefield with practiced ease. By dessert,l was mentally exhausted.

"I've been thinking," Mom said as Helen served coffee, "about Camille's journals."

I froze, cup halfway to my lips. "Journals?"

"She kept them since childhood. Hidden in that loose floorboard in her closet,though she thought I didn't know." Mom's eyes never left my face. "Interesting reading."
Ice filled my veins. Camille's journals. The private thoughts of a girl who saw more than she let on, who might have documented suspicions, patterns, manipulations over the years. Things I definitely didn't want exposed.

"You've been reading her private thoughts?" | infused my voice with gentle shock. "Mom, that seerns...invasive.Wouldn't Camille want her privacy respected, even now?"

"Perhaps." Mom sipped her coffee, eyes never leaving mine. "But they've given me such insight into her state of mind in those final weeks. Her concerns about her marriage. Her doubts about certain relationships."

Dad shifted uncomfortably. "Margaret, is this appropriate dinner conversation?"

"When is it appropriate to discuss our daughter's death, Richard? When is it convenient to question why her body was never found? When should we examine why she drove to that bridge on a night she was supposed to be meeting you?" She pointed a slightly unsteady finger at me.

There it was. The accusation I'd been sensing. The dangerous question.

"I told the police," I said calmly, "CCamille canceled our dinner plans at the last minute. Said she wasn't feeling well.I assumed she went home."

"Yes, that's what you told them." Mom's voice was dangerously quiet. "But her journal entry that day says she was excited about your dinner. About reconnecting with her sister after all the 'misunderstandings'about Stefan."

My mouth went dry. Damn Camille and her pathetic journaling habit.

"People change their minds, Mom. Maybe she wrote that earlier in the day, before she started feeling unwell."

"Maybe." Mom set down her cup with deliberate care.r maybe something else happened. Something that drove her to that bridge. Or someone."

"Margaret!" Dad's voice was sharp with warning. "You can't possibly be suggesting..."
"I'm not suggesting anything." She stood, swaying slightly. "I'm simply a mother with questions about her daughter's death. Questions our other daughter seems strangely reluctant to explore."

With that parting shot, she left the dining room, her footsteps unsteady on the stairs. Dad and I sat in stunned silence for several long moments.

"She doesn't mean it," he finally said, running a hand through his thinning hair."Grief makes people irrational. She'll come around."

But we both knew she wouldn't. The seed of doubt had been planted, and now it was growing, fed by newspaper articles and missing bodies and mysterious journal entries.

I left shortly after, pleading work commitments. In the car, I finally allowed myself to drop the mask, anxiety crawling.across my skin like ants. This was bad. Worse than I'd anticipated.

Mom's suspicions. The journals. The private investigator.

Even Stefan might turn against me if he learned the full truth. He'd been increasingly distant these past weeks, withdrawing into grief and guilt over the divorce papers he'd signed the day before Camille disappeared. The poor fool actually believed he might have contributed to heruicide"by ending their marriage.

I'd carefully nurtured that belief, of course. Better he blame himself than look too closely at me. Better everyone think Camille had been driven to desperation by her failing marriage than suspect I'd arranged for men to frighten her that night, a plan that had gone terribly wrong when they took things too far.

I poured myself a drink as soon as I entered my apartment, mind racing through contingencies. First priority:find those journals and see exactly what Camille had written. Second: ensure my mother's private investigator discovered nothing but evidence supporting the accident theory.

And if that didn't work? A chill ran through me, not fear, but cold determination. When I faced myself in the mirror, my expression was steady, certain.

Then I'd create a new narrative. One where my grief-stricken mother, unable to accept the tragic loss of her daughter, became obsessed with conspiracy theories and wild accusations.
Yes, I'd discredit my own mother if necessary. I'd do whatever it took to protect what I'd built.

Tomorrow I would identify the shoe they found, with appropriate sisterly emotion. Then I'd visit Mom,see if l could locate those journals. The situation was still manageable,still within my control.

Even Stefan,unwittngly useful in my plans, would continue playing his part, the grieving ex-husband who'd found comfort with his wife's sister after an appropriate mourning period. He had no idea how l'd orchestrated everything, from the beginning of their relationship to its tragic end.

Men like Stefan were so easy to manipulate. So eager to believe what you wanted them to believe. So desperate to be loved that they never questioned the convenient timing of your affections.

If those journals contained what I feared, Camille's observations of my manipulations, her documentation of our conflicts, her growing suspicions about my intentions, they could provide exactly the motive police would look for if the case reopened.

And reopening the case was precisely what my mother seemed determined to achieve.

The direct approach confronting Mom, demanding the journals, would only confirm her suspicions.Searching her house while they slept risked discovery. Having them stolen would raise obvious questions.

No,I needed something subtler. A way to discredit the journals if they surfaced, or better yet, ensure they never did.

By the time I reached my apartment, a plan was forming. Mom's drinking had increased steadily since Camille's disappearance. Her behavior was becoming erratic, her accusations more pointed. With the right nudge, I could push her from grieving mother to unstable conspiracy theorist in the eyes of everyone who mattered.①

Entering my apartment, I kicked off my heels and poured a glass of wine. Tomorrow would begin with identifying a waterlogged shoe, continuing my performance as the dutiful, grieving sister. But behind that mask, calculations would continue.

I'd come too far to be derailed now. My fashion line was taking off. My place in society was secured. The family fortune would eventually be mine alone. Everything was proceeding according to plan, despite these unexpected complications.
As I prepared for bed, my phone pinged wwith a news alert. I opened it, expecting more questions about Camille's case.

Instead,the headline made my blood freeze.

*RECLUSIVE HEIRESS REVEALED: VICTORIA KANE INTRODUCES ADOPTED DAUGHTER AS COMPANY SUCCESSOR**


Beneath it, a photo showed Victoria Kane, tech Trillionaire, ruthless business titan, notoríous recluse,standing beside a striking young woman with sharp cheekbones and penetrating eyes. The caption identified her as Camille Kane, Victoria's adopted daughter, newly introduced to society after years of private education abroad.

Something about the woman's face tickled at my memory. Something familiar in the eyes, the stance, the subtle tilt of her chin. But different enough that I couldn't place it.

The article detailed how this mysterious Camille Kane had been adopted as a child, educated at elite European schools, and was now stepping into the spotlight as Victoria's heir apparent. A business procigy with degrees from Stanford and Harvard, now taking the reins of a corporate empire.

I skimmed the piece, irritated by the distraction. Some rich woman's pet project had no bearing on my current problems. I closed the article and set my phone aside, returning to more pressing concerns.

The shoe. The journals. My mother's suspicions. Stefan's weakness. All issues requiring immediate attention.


Yet as I drifted toward sleep, the image of Camille Kane's face floated in my mind. Those eyes. Where had I seen eyes like that before? Something about them unsettled me deeply, though I couldn't say why.

A problem for another day. Tonight, I needed rest before tomorrow's performance at the police station. The grieving sister, identifying a shoe that might have belonged to her beloved Camille. A heartrending scene in the ongoing tragedy.

The show must go on. At least until I could ensure the final curtain fell exactly where and how I wanted it to.
###Chapter 19

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW

Four months into my new life as Camille Kane, I finally had a day to myself. No combat training with Jason.No business lessons. No public appearances or meetings with Victoria's corporate associates. Just twenty-four hours of unscheduled time stretching before me like an unexpected gift.

I'd almost forgotten wwhat freedom felt like.

The morning sun streamed through my bedroom windows as I lingered over breakfast on my private balcony. Below, gardeners tended the immaculate grounds of Victoria's estate, a sprawling property that occupied thirty acres of prime real estate just outside Manhattan. Despite living here for months, I'd seen only a fraction of it, my daily routine too packed with lessons and training to allow exploration.

But not today.

I dressed casually in jeans and a sweater, clothes I rarely wore now that my wardrobe consisted primarily of designer business attire and formal wear. My reflection in the mirror still startled me sometimes, the sharper cheekbones, the more refined nose, the elegant bob that had replaced my once-long hair. A woman designed for power rather than pleasing others.

Victoria had left at dawn for a business trip to Tokyo, taking James and her usual security detail with her.The mansion felt different without her commanding presence, quieter, less intense, almost peaceful.

"Ms. Kane?" A soft knock accompanied the housekeeper's voice./ill you be needing anything before l leave for my sister's wedding?"

Mrs. Chen, the, only staff member who lived off-premises, had mentioned the family event weeks ago."NO,thank you, Mrs,Chen.Enjoy the wedding."

"There's food prepared in the refrigerator, I'll return tomorrow evening."
Her footsteps faded down the hallway. Minutes later, the distant sound of the service entrance closing left me truly alone in the massive house for the first time since my arrival.

Completely alone. No Victoria. No staff. No security beyond the perimeter guards who monitored the property's edges without entering the grounds.

Perfect.

I'd been mapping the mansion in my head for months, noting areas I was subtly dliscouraged from entering,doors that remained locked, topics that caused Victoria to change the conversation. One section in particular had drawn my curiosity, the east wing of the third floor, accessible only through a corridor that was always locked.

Victoria's master suite occupied the west wing of the same floor, my rooms the south wing. The north contained guest suites I'd seen during my initial tour. But the east wing remained a mystery, mentioned by neither Victoria nor the staff, as if it didn't exist at all.

Today,I would solve that mystery.

I made my way through the mansion's main floor, footsteps echoing on marble and hardwood. How strange to walk these grand hallways without Victoria's watchful eyes tracking my movements, evaluating my posture, assessing my gait. Freedom, even temporary, felt both exhilarating and unsettling after months of constant supervision.

The main staircase swept upward in a graceful curve, its carved banister cool beneath my palm. Second floor, then third. The hallway branched in four directions, each leading to a different wing. The corridor to the east wing ended in a heavy wooden door with an ornate handle, and as expected, it was locked.

I examined it closely, remembering Jason's lessons about security and access points. Not a keypad or electronic lock, but an old-fashioned key lock, the kind barely seen in homes of this caliber anymore.Deliberately old-fashioned. Deliberately personal.

A key would be needed. But where would Victoria keep a key to a door she clearly wanted to remain closed?

Her office seemed the logical place to start. I made my way back down to the main floor, to the wood-paneled room where Victoria handled matters too private for her corporate headquarters. The door was unlocked, a surprise given her usual caution, but then, she likely never expected me to explore while she was gone.

Sunlight poured through tall windows, illuminating the space that perfectly reflected its owner: elegant,intimidating, deliberately impressive. A massive desk dominated the center, its surface bare except for a laptop and a single framned photo turned at an angle I couldn't see from the doorway.

I hesitated at the threshold. This felt different from my curiosity about the locked wing. This was a deliberate invasion of Victoria's private space, a breach of the trust she'd placed in me. But wasn't she invading my privacy daily with her demands, her reshaping of my identity, her constant monitoring of my transformation?

Decision made, I crossed to the desk, immediately drawn to the framed photo. It showed a younger Victoria with her arm around a smiling young woman who could only be Sophia, tall, confident, with eyes that matched her mother's in both color and intensity. They stood on a beach somewhere, casual in a way l'd never seen Victoria, their matching sunglasses pushed up on their heads, genuine smiles brightening both faces.

Happy. They looked genuinely happy.

I set the photo down carefully, exactly as I'd found it, and began my search. The desk drawers yielded nothing of interest, business papers, correspondence, a spare pair of reading glasses. No keys.

Next, I examined the bookshelves lining the walls, looking for hidden compartments or safes. Nothing. The elegant cabinet bar contained only spirits and crystal glasses. The paintings, all originals by renowned artists, concealed nothing behind them.

I was about to give up when I noticed a small decorative box on one of the bookshelves, half-hidden behind leather-bound volumes. Made of carved jade with silver fittings, it seemed out of place among the business books and historical biographies.

Inside lay a single brass key, antique and heavy in my palm. It looked exactly like what would fit the lock to the east wing.,

Heart beating faster, I returned to the third floor, key clutched tightly in my hand. At the locked door, I hesitated again,knowing I was crossing a boundary that might change my relationship with Victoria forever.
But I'd come too far to turn back. I inserted the key, feeling the mechanism shift as I turned it. A soft click,and the door swung open into darkness.

The corridor beyond was shadowed, curtains drawn over windows that would have illuminated it naturally.I fumbled for a light switch, finding one just inside the doorway. Soft lighting revealed a hallway lined with framed photographs, each capturing moments in Sophia's life.

Sophia as a toddler in a frilly dress. Sophia in a cap and gown, proudly holding a diploma. Sophia laughing on a sailboat, wind catching her hair. In each image, her resemblance to me was undeniable, despite the cosmetic changes I'd undergone. We shared the same eyes, the same smile, similar builds.

No wonder Victoria had been drawn to me after seeing my photo. The resemblance was unsettling even to me.

The hallway opened into a small sitting area, preserved like a museum exhibit. Magazines from ten years ago lay on coffee tables. A half-finished chess game sat frozen in time, pieces dustless despite the years,suggesting regular cleaning. Two teacups rested on saucers beside the chess board, as if the players had just stepped away momentarily.

Victoria and Sophia's last game together? The thought sent a shiver through me.

Three doors led from the sitting area. I tried the first, finding a small study with a desk covered in engineering textbooks and mathematical journals. Notes in a neat, precise handwriting filled notebooks stacked beside a laptop that looked ancient by today's standards. A MIT sweatshirt hung over the back of the chair.

Sophia's study area. Preserved exactly as she'd left it a decade ago.

The second door revealed a bathroom, everything feminine and elegant. Makeup still arranged on the counter, perfume bottles lined up precisely, a toothbrush in a holder beside the sink.

The third door, slightly ajar, took my breath away.

Sophia's bedroom. A large, beautiful space decorated in shades of blue and silver, dominated by a queen-sized bed with an intricate wrought iron headboard. Sunlight streamed through a gap in heavy curtains,illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.
I stepped Inside, teeling like an Iistruder in a sacred space. The room smelted faintly of lavandier and something elge, a lingering trace of perfume, porhaps. Evorything was lmmaculate, from the prenlsely made bed to the organlzed booksheff to the desk with pens alltanged at perfect angles.

Photos covered one wall, Sophla with friends, with Victorla, with a handsome young man who must have been Oliver Preston, the fiancé whose famlly had arranged her fata "accident." Ih many of the images,Sophia wore the same silver perdarit Victorla had given mo, the phoenl rising from flames.

On the bedside table sat a framed photo of Sophria and Victoria, arms around each other, foreheads touching, smiling with such genulne joy that my chest ached looking at i. The kind of mother-daughter relationship 1'd never had, never even witnessed between Rose and my own mother.

I picked up the photo, studying the happiness captured there. Victoria,cold, demanding, perfeationistic Victoria,looked transformed by love for her daughter. Softer, More huran.

“What are you doing in here?"
###Chapter 20

Camille's point of view

The voice behind me sent the frame tumbling from my hands. It hit the carpet with a muffled thud as I spun around.

Victoria stood in the doorway, her expression a storm of fury and pain. Her usually perfect appearance was disheveled, clothes wrinkled from travel, hair slightly mussed, as if she'd rushed home unexpectedly.

"L...I thought you were in Tokyo,"1stammered,heart hammering against my ribs.

"Flight canceled due to mechanical issues." Her eyes swept the room, cataloging any disturbance I might have caused. "You didn't answer my question."

I could have lied. Could have claimed I got lost, accidentally found the key, had innocent reasons for snooping. But something in Victoria's face, the raw wound exposed beneath her anger, demanded honesty.

"I was curious," | admitted, bending to retrieve the fallen photo frame. "About the locked wing. About why it was off-limits."

"So you invaded my privacy. Searched my office for the key. Entered a space clearly meant to remain closed." Each sentence fell like a judgment, cold and precise.

"Yes." No excuses. No justifications.

Victoria's gaze settled on the photo in my hands. Something flickered across her expression, grief so intense it momentarily overwhelmed the anger.

"Put that down," she said quietly."And get out."

I carefully returned the frame to its place. "Victoria, 1... "Now."

I moved toward the door, expecting her to step aside. Instead, she remained planted in the doorway, forcing me to squeeze past her, close enough to feel the rigid tension in her body, to smell the subtle scent of her perfume mixed with the staleness of long-haul travel.

In the sitting area, I paused, turning back to find her still watching from Sophia's doorway, one hand gripping the frame as if for support.

"I'm sorry," I said softly. "I shouldn't have..."

"Do you know what today is?" she interrupted, voice unnaturally controlled.

I shook my head, unease growing at the intensity of her gaze.

"It's her birthday." Victoria's knuckles whitened on the doorframe. "She would have been thirty-three today."


The revelation hit like a physical blow. Of all days to violate this sanctuary, I'd chosen the one when Victoria's grief would be freshest, most raw.

"I didn't know," I whispered.

"No." Something in her tone shifted, the cold fury giving way to something more complex. "You didn't.Because I never told you."

She finally stepped away from the doorway, moving to the chess board in the sitting area. With careful precision, she adjusted one of the pieces, a knight moving to threaten a bishop.

"Sophia loved chess," she said, not looking at me. "Insisted it helped her think strategically. We played every Sunday morning. This was our last game, the morning before she died."

I remained motionless, afraid any movement might shatter this unexpected moment of vulnerability.

"I've kept it exactly as we left it. Sometimes I sit here and try to remember what move she was contemplating." Victoria's finger hovered over a white pawn. "She always took her time, considered every possibility. Unlike me, I played aggressively, impatiently. She used that against me."
The parallel to our relationship, her aggressive molding of me, my attempts to anticipate her expectations,hung unspoken between us.

"Ten years," Victoria continued, finally looking up at me. "Ten years of coming here on her bírthday, sitting in her space, pretending for a few hours that she's just stepped out. That she'll return any moment with some brilliant observation or terrible pun or news about her latest project."

My chest tightened at the naked pain in her expression. Gone was the formidable businesswoman, the ruthless mentor, the demanding adoptive mother. In her place stood simply a woman hollowed by grief,preserving the remains of a life cut short.

"She was more than my daughter," Victoria said, sinking onto the sofa beside the chess set. "She was the best of me. The kindness I couldn't afford to show, the warmth I'd forgotten how to express, the hope I'd lost in climbing to the top. Everything pure I'd sacrificed along the way somehow manifested in her."

I cautiously sat opposite her, feeling the weight of the moment. Victoria had never spoken this openly before, never revealed so much of herself.

"When she died, I wanted to die too." She touched a chess piece, the black queen, with gentle fingers."But then revenge became my purpose. Destroying the Prestons gave me a reason to continue.. And when that was done, when they were ruined, I had nothing left but an empire built on ashes."

"Until you saw my photo," I said softly.

Her eyes met mine, sharp with sudden intensity."Dyou know what I thought when I first saw/ you? Not just that you looked like her, though the resemblance was striking. I thought: here's another bright young woman being systematically destroyed by people who should protect her. Here's another life being smothered by those with power over it."

Victoria leaned forward slightly.recognized in you what the Prestons tried to stamp out in Sophia.Potential. Intelligence. A fundamental strength your family never nurtured."

"But you barely knew me,"lcountered. "One photo in a society magazine...."

"I had you investigated thoroughly," she interrupted. "Every aspect of your life examined. Your education records.Your medical history. Your social circles. The more I learned, the more clearly I saw the parallels,
and the differences."

"Differences?"

"Sophia was loved. Cherished. Supported in all her dreams. You were undermined at every turn, yet still fought to carve out your own space. Imagine what you might have become with proper nurturing instead of constant sabotage."

The observation stung with its accuracy. All my life, I'd been swimming against the current of my family's preferences, Rose's manipulations, society's expectations.

"That's why I offered you this chance," Victoria continued. "Not just because you resembled her physically.Not just for revenge against those who hurt you. But because I recognized something worth saving. Worth building."

The admission hung between us, more honest than anything she'd shared in our months together. I felt the weight of it, her recognition of my value independent of my usefulness for revenge or my resemblance to Sophia.

"When I saw you in hereVictoria said, gesturing toward Sophia's bedroom, "my first thought wasn't anger at the invasion of privacy. It was terror that you might damage something, change something,disrupt the preservation of her space."

"I would never," I began, but she raised a hand to silence me.

"I know. But grief isn't rational. This wing has remained untouched for a decade, cleaned only by me,entered only by me. These rooms are all I have left of her physical presence in the world."

She stood suddenly, moving back to the bedroom doorway, staring inside with an expression of such longing it made my throat tighten.

"She was brilliant," Victoria said softly. "Could have run the company better than I ever did. Had this extraordinary ability to see connections others missed. But more importantly, she was kind. Genuinely kind,in a world that rarely rewards such qualities."

I joined her at the doorway, following her gaze to the room bathed in afternoon sunlight."Tell me about her,"
I said. "Not just the facts I could find in news articles or company biographies. Tell me who she really was."

Victoria glanced at me, surprise evident in her expression. Then something softened around her eyes.

"She snorted when she laughed too hard. Couldn't carry a tune to save her life but sang constantly anyway.Loved spicy food and old black-and-white movies and thunderstorms." A small, genuine smile touched Victoria's lips. "She had this ridiculous collection of novelty socks, zombies and dinosaurs and mathematical equations. Said life was too serious not to have silly socks."

Each detail built a picture of a real person, not just the perfect daughter of Victoria's rare mentions or the tragic victim of a calculated accident. A young woman with quirks and passions and imperfections.

"She sounds wonderful," I said sincerely.

"She was." Victoria's smile faded. "And I couldn't protect her."

The admission carried such weight, Victoria Kane, who controlled billion-dollar deals and intimidated world leaders,acknowledging her ultimate failure at the one thing that truly mattered to her.

that why you're training me so ruthlessly?" I asked, the connection suddenly clear. "To ensure I can protect myself when you can't protect me?"
###Chapter 21

Camille's point of view

Victoria's gaze sharpened. "Yes. Every lesson, every challenge, every seemingly excessive demand,they all serve that purpose. To make you stronger than Sophia was. More prepared for the dangers wealth and power attract."

"And to make me capable of the revenge you've planned."

"That too," she acknowledged. "The people who hurt you must pay for what they've done. But beyond revenge lies something more important, your future. What you'll build after justice is served."

I considered her words, understanding for the first time that Victoria's vision extended beyond my usefulness as an instrument of revenge. She was investing in me for reasons beyond my resemblance to Sophia or my vendetta against Rose.

"I still shouldn't have come in here without permission,"Isaid after a moment. "This space is sacred to you.I violated that."

Victoria sighed, tension visibly leaving her shoulders. "Perhaps it was inevitable. Perhaps it was even necessary." She turned fully toward me. "You cannot become who you need to be while seeing me as merely a mentor or benefactor. You need to understand who I am beneath the power and wealth."

"A mother who lost her child," I said softly.

"Yes." The simple acknowledgment carried volumes of pain. "A woman who built an empire, then watched it become meaningless in an instant when her daughter's heart stopped beating."

She stepped into Sophia's room, beckoning me to follow. This time the invitation was deliberate, conscious.She moved to the closet, sliding open the door to reveal clothing still hanging neatly, designer dresses,casual wear, university sweatshirts.
"She was taller than you," Victoria observed. "More athletic build. Preferred blues and greens to the warm tones that suit your coloring."

From a high shelf, she removed a small wooden box inlaid with mother-of-pearl. "Sophia's jewelry. Things she cherished, mostly for sentimental rather than monetary value."

She opened the box, revealing an eclectic collection, some fine pieces but also quirky earrings, friendship bracelets, the kind of personal treasures that told a life's story.

Victoria selected something from the box, a delicate silver bracelet with a single charm, a tiny chess piece.A knight.

"Her favorite piece," Victoria explained. "She said knights were the most interesting because they move differently than everything else on the board. Unconventional. Less direct but sometimes more effective."

She held out the bracelet to me. "She would want you to have this."

The gesture stunned me, Victoria offering something that had belonged to Sophia, inviting me to carry a piece of her daughter's memory.

"I couldn't possibly..."

"You can," Victoria interrupted firmly."And you will. Not because you're replacing her, no one could. But because you're continuing something she valued, the courage to move in unexpected ways across the board."

With trembling fingers, I accepted the bracelet, feeling its weight, physical and symbolic, in my palm.Victoria watched as l.fastened it around my wrist, the tiny silver knight catching the light.

"Thank you," I whispered, understanding the magnitude of the gesture.

Victoria nodded once, then glanced around the room with a long, measuring look. "Ten years," she said softly. "A decade of preserving everything exactly as it was on her last day."

Something in her voice had changed, a note of finality, of decision.

"Perhaps," she continued slowly, "it's time to begin letting go. Not forgetting, never forgetting. But acknowledging that preserving rooms exactly as they were won't bring her back."

She moved to the curtains, pulling them further open to allow more sunlight to flood the room. Dust motes danced in the golden light, bringing warmth to the long-closed space.

"A mausoleum serves no one," Victoria said, more to herself than to me. "Not the dead, certainly not the living."

I watched as she straightened a picture frame, adjusted a book on the nightstand, small gestures that seemed to signify a shift in her decade-long relationship with grief.

"| come here to remember," she continued. "But memory doesn't require that time stand still." She turned to me, eyes clearer than I'd ever seen them. "Sophia would hate knowing l've kept her rooms like this,unchanged, unbreathing. She was always moving forward, always evolving."

"What will you do?" |asked.

"Not erase her," Victoria clarified quickly. "Never that. But perhaps... begin to interact with her memory differently. Keep what matters most, let go of the rest."

She gathered the framed photo from the bedside table, the one showing mother and daughter with foreheads touching, and held it carefully in both hands.

"This comes with me. The chest pieces we were playing with. Her journals. The things that captured her essence." Victoria's voice remained steady, though I could see the cost of this decision in the tightness around her eyes. "The rest... perhaps it's time to consider what might honor her memory better than preservation in amber."

As we left Sophia's rooms together, Victoria paused at the chess set. With deliberate movements, she completed the move she'd been contemplating, the white pawn advancing rather than retreating.

"She would have countered brilliantly," Victoria said with quiet certainty. "She always did."

In the hallway, I waited as Victoria locked the door behind us, the soft click of the mechanism somehow less final than when I'd unlocked it earlier. Something had shifted between us, some barrier falling away to reveal the woman beneath the formidable exterior.
"I have one question," I said as we walked toward the main part of the house.

Victoria raised an eyebrow, the familiar gesture almost comforting after the emotional intensity of the past hour.

"The phoenix pendant you gave me when I first arrived, it matches the one Sophia wore in many of her photos."

"Yes," Victoria confirmed. "It was a design I commissioned when she graduated fromn MIT. A symbol of transformation, of emerging stronger through fire." She glanced at the bracelet now circling my wrist. "You now wear both symbols, the knight who moves unpredictably and the phoenix who rises from destruction."

The significance wasn't lost on me. "Is that how you see me? A combination of Sophia's unconventional thinking and my own rebirth through adversity?"

Victoria stopped walking, turning to face me fullyin the grand hallway. Afternoon sun streamed through tall windows, highlighting the silver in her hair, the fine lines around her eyes, signs of humanity often obscured by her powerful presence.

"What I see," she said carefully, "is someone finding her own path while carrying meaningful symbols from those who came before. Not a replacement for my daughter. Not merely a vehicle for revenge.But a young woman becoming something unique, something powerful,something entirely her own."

She touched the phoenix pendant at my throat lightly, then the knight charm on my wrist. "These are reminders, not definitions. You'll forge your own symbols in time."

As we continued walking, side by side through the mansion that had become my home, I felt a subtle but significant change in our relationship. For the first time, Victoria had allowed me to see beyond her carefully constructed facade to the wounded heart beneath. For the first time, I understood that her demanding nature came not just from perfectionism but from fear, fear of failing to protect another young woman under her care.

And for the first time, I wondered if revenge alone would satisfy either of us. If perhaps something more complex, more healing might lie beyond the destruction we'd planned for those who had wounded us.
###Chapter 22

ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW

The shoe sat on Detective Ramirez's desk between us. A woman's size seven pump, once black, now gray-green from three months underwater. The heel had broken off, but the designer's red sole remained visible.Louboutin.Unmistakably Camille's.

"Is this your sister's shoe, Ms. Lewis?" Detective Ramirez asked, his tired eyes watching my reaction carefully.

I reached for it with trembling fingers, a calculated tremor l'd practiced thatmorning.whispered,voice breaking on cue. "She wore these the last time I saw her. A gift from our parents for her birthday."

The lie slid out smoothly. In truth, I'd given Camille those shoes when she landed her first job, playing the generous big sister while privately mocking her pathetic excitement over my hand-me-downs.

"Does seeing this personal item bring up any new thoughts about your sister's state of mind before her disappearance?"

An interesting question. Not "accident" or"drowning,"but"disappearance." The detective's word choice revealed his lingering doubts.

"Your parents mentioned Camille kept journals," he continued. "Have you had a chance to read them?"

So Mom had spoken to the police about the journals. This was worse than I thought.

"I... I couldn't bear to read them," I said, looking away as if overcome. "Too painful. Mom mentioned she found some, but she's been very private about their contents."

"And your relationship with Mr. Rodriguez? Your sister's ex-husband?"

"Stefan and I have found comfort in our shared grief,"I said carefully."Wwere friends before he and Camille dated. After a respectful period of mourning, we've... reconnected."

After leaving the station, I called Martin Greene, the family's trusted fixer. "I need everything you can get on Detective Ramirez.And I need to know exactly what my mother told the police about Camille's journals."

Then I headed to my parents' house. Mom was at her weekly therapy appointment, an engagement I'd encouraged to keep her sedated with grief counseling and antidepressants.

The house was quiet when I arrived. I moved through Camille's room methodically, checking obvious hiding places. Nothing. The floorboard Mom had mentioned yielded nothing but an empty space.

Mom's private sitting room, then. The small sunlit space where she spent hours alone. On her writing desk sat a mahogany box with a brass lock.

"Looking for something?"

Mom's voice from the doorway froze me in place. She stood watching me, more sober and alert than l'd seen in months.

"Mom," I said, forcing warmth into my voice. "I didn't expect you back so soon."

She moved to the box, unlocked it, and withdrew a journal. "September 14th, ten years ago: 'Rose told Jason I stuffed my bra before the dance. Now he won't talk to me. She says she was just joking, but she smiles when she thinks I'm not looking.'"

My mind raced back. Jason Parker, Camille's first crush. I'd spent weeks helping her get his attention, only to whisper that carefully crafted lie at precisely the right moment.

"Teenage drama," I said dismissively. "Camille was always sensitive."

Mom took out another journal. "April 2nd, eight years ago: 'Got my Stanford acceptance today. Rose says it's probably a mistake. Now I can't stop worrying they'll realize they didn't mean to accept me."

"I was trying to,protect her from disappointment," I protested. "Stanford is highly competitive."

Mom slammed the journal shut. "You know what happened next? She called the admissions office to 'confirm' they wanted her. They thought she was having a mental health crisis. When we decided she wasn't ready for college, based largely on your concerns about her emotional stability, that call reinforced our decision."

Time for the nuclear option.

"Mom," I whispered, "I didn't want to tell you this, but... Camille had problems none of us understood. The last time we spoke, she said things that frightened me."

"What things?"

"She talked about hearing voices sometimes. About feeling watched." The lies flowed smoothly,tailored to match symptoms I knew Mom feared. Her own mother had suffered from paranoid delusions.

"That's not possible," Mom said, but doubt had crept into her voice.

"Would she write about it if she was hiding it? Mom, I've been carrying this guilt for months, wondering if l should have told someone. If I could have prevented what happened."

"When her car went into the river," Icontinued softly, "I wondered if... if it wasn't an accident. If maybe the voices told her to do it."

Mom sank into her chair, face ashen. "I should have known. A mother should know when her child is suffering."

"You couldn't have known," I soothed, watching my carefully crafted lies take root. "Camille was good at hiding things."

"I need to tell your father. And the detective."

"Are you sure that's wise?" | asked gently."Camille wanted this kept private. And mental health stigma is still so prevalent."

"Perhaps wait," I suggested. "Read through the journals again, looking for signs you might have missed. Let me help you," I,offered, reaching for the box. "Two sets of eyes might catch what one misses."

She hesitated only briefly before nodding. The box of journals, the evidence I'd been desperate to secure,was now being handed to me willingly.
When I left an hour later, Mom looked lighter somehow. The poison of suspicion had been drained, replaced with a new narrative that absolved her of responsibility while redirecting her focus from me to Camille's fabricated mental health struggles.

In the car,l immediately texted Martin: *Cancel the Ramirez investigation. Situation contained.*

Looking at the mahogany box beside me, I felt a surge of satisfaction. By tonight, any evidence of my careful dismantling of Camille's life would be ashes. And the official narrative would shift subtly, not an accident,not murder, but a troubled young woman's final desperate act.

Perfect Rose, the devoted sister, carrying her tragic secret to protect her family's peace of mind. The story practically wrote itself. Mental illness was such a convenient explanation for inconvenient truths. Camille's real voice had been silenced forever in that river. Now I would ensure that even her written words told the story I chose for them to tell.

 ###Chapter 23

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW

The scream ripped from my throat before | was fully awake, my body jackknifing upright in bed. Sweat soaked through my silk nightgown, heart hammering against my ribs like it might break through. For a moment, I didn't know where I was, lost in the space between nightmare and reality.

Rose's face, smiling as I drowned. Stefan watching from the shore, doing nothing. Their fingers intertwined as they witnessed my death, as casual as if they were watching a sunset.

"Ms. Kane?" A knock at my bedroom door. "Do you need assistance?"

The night guard. New guy. Torres or Torrez. I couldn't remember his name. Victoria rotated security personnel regularly, another layer of protection in her perfectly orchestrated world.

"I'm fine," I called back, voice steadier than I felt. "Just a dream."

"Yes, ma'am. Dr. Reed has been notified as per protocol."

Of course she had. Everything in Victoria's mansion was monitored, measured, reported. Privacy was a luxury I'd surrendered along with my old identity. I checked the clock, 3:17 AM. Another night ruined by memories that refused to stay buried.

Six months of training. Six months of becoming someone new. Six months of Victoria's relentless program to transform me from victim to avenger. And still, my subconscious betrayed me, dragging me back into drowning dreams night after night.

My phone lit up with a text: *My office. 15 minutes.-Dr.Reed*

No sympathy. No option to reschedule. Just a command thinly disguised as a message. Typical of Victoria's handpicked psychologist.
I shuffled to my bathroom, splashing cold water on my face. The woman in the mirror had changed dramatically since Victoria had found me, cheekbones sharper from the surgical refinements, hair styled in an elegant bob, eyes harder from months of combat training. But in the hours after a nightmare, I still saw traces of the old Camille beneath the carefully crafted exterior. Vulnerable. Afraid.Weak.

Dr.Reed would not approve.

Her office looked exactly as it always did, clinically organized, dimly lit, with two leather chairs facing each other across a glass table. No couch. No friendly plants or personal photos to soften the atmosphere.Dr.Reed didn't believe in comfort during our sessions. The sharp angles and sterile surfaces matched her approach,precise, unforgiving, designed to cut through emotional defenses.

"Same dream?" she asked, silver-streaked dark hair pulled back in a severe bun, eyes sharp as they assessed my disheveled state. At fifty-something, she had the toned physique of someone half her age and the penetrating gaze of someone who regularly dissected minds for sport.

"Yes." I sank into the leather chair, the cool surface a stark contrast to my overheated skin. "I'm in the car.Water rising. Rose and Stefan watching from the bridge, smiling. The door's jammed. I scream for help,but they just watch. Rose whispers something to Stefan. He laughs. Then the water covers my face and..." My voice caught. "I start to drown."

"Any variations from previous instances?"

"Rose was wearing my wedding dress this time." The detail had twisted like a knife in my gut, even in sleep.

Dr. Reed made a note on her tablet. "Six months of nightmares. Who told you stopping them was the goal?"

"Isn't that what therapy is for? Healing trauma?"

"Conventional therapy, yes. But you're not receiving conventional therapy, Camille. You're receiving specialized psychological conditioning designed for Victoria Kane's specific objectives."

"Which are?"

"To weaponize your trauma rather than heal it. Your pain is power if you control it instead of letting it control you. Do you think Victoria became who she is by processing her grief in healthy ways? By moving on from what the Prestons did to her daughter?"

The bluntness hit me like a physical blow. She moved to a cabinet, retrieving a virtual reality headset. State-of-the-art,probably custom-made. Nothing but the best in Victoria's world.

"Put this on," she instructed. "I think you're ready for immersion therapy. Time to control the outcome of your nightmare."

My hands trembled as I took the headset. "You want me to relive drowning? Voluntarily?"

"I want you to finish what your subconscious starts every night. You wake up at the moment of drowning.I want you to see what happens after."

The simulation was terrifyingly real, the car interior, the rising water, Rose and Stefan watching from above.Initially, panic seized me, the memory of that night too vivid, too raw. But something shifted inside me as l watched Rose's smug smile. Rage sparked through my terror. Hot, clarifying rage.

The water stopped rising. Began to recede. In my mind, I pushed against the car door. It opened. Not possible in reality, not with water pressure, but this wasn't reality. This was my mind, my rules. I stepped out of the sinking car, but instead of drowning, I rose. Moved upward through the water as if gravity had reversed.

I emerged from the river like an avenging angel, dressed in a tailored power suit, hair perfectly styled,makeup flawless. Rose's smile faltered as | stood on the water's surface. When I raised my hand, the bridge began to crumble beneath them.

"Please!" Dream-Rose cried out as she fell, reaching toward me. "Camille, help us!"

I watched, unmoved, as they plunged into the dark water. Dream-Stefan tried to swim toward the shore,abandoning Rose to save himself. Typical. Even in my imagination, he was a coward.

"How did it feel?" Dr. Reed asked when I removed the headset, hands shaking.

"Good," I admitted, shame and satisfaction warring inside me. "It felt good."

"Then why are you crying?"
I touched my cheek, surprised to find it wet. "Because the person who enjoyed that isn't who I used to be."

"No," she agreed. "She's who you're becoming. Who you need to be."

She pulled out a manila folder filled with surveillance photos-Rose and Stefan together over the past months. At restaurants. Shopping. Entering his apartment. Their happiness documented in cruel detail.One shot showed them at a jewelry store I recognized, another at the restaurant I'd always wanted to try but Stefan had dismissed as overpriced. They were building their perfect life in the spaces I'd left behind.

"Study your enemy's happiness," Dr. Reed said coolly. "It's what you'll take from them first."

I forced myself to look at every photo. Their casual intimacy. The way his hand rested at the small of her back.Her head tilted toward him in laughter. The tender expression on his face as he brushed hair from her eyes, a look he'd rarely given me.

"What do you feel?" she asked.

"Humiliation," I whispered, the truth finally breaking free. "That everyone can see I was just the placeholder.The practice wife before he got the one he really wanted. I knew, you know. Even before the divorce papers.Before I found evidence. A part of me always knew Rose was the one Stefan truly wanted."

"And beneath that?"

"I stayed because | couldn't bear to admit Rose had won again. That even my marriage was just another competition she'd bested me in without even trying." The bitterness coated my words. "I thought if I tried harder, loved him more perfectly, he'd finally see me. Really see me."

"But he never did," Dr. Reed said simply.

"No. He only married me because he couldn't have her. I was the consolation prize. The easier option. The one who would say yes when Rose initially said no."

"The nightmarés persist because you're still seeing yourself as their victim. Even in your dreams,they stand above while you drown below. The VR session showed progress, you reversed the positions. But you're still defining yourself in relation to them."
At the door, I paused, struck by a sudden curiosity. "What truth were you hiding? When you helped Victoria after Sophia died?"

For the first timne, Dr. Reed's clinical mask slipped. "I was engaged to Victoria's husband before she met him. He chose her instead. I introduced them. Watched their perfect life from the periphery. Was the first person Victoria called when the Prestons murdered Sophia."

The confession stunned me. This cold, clinical woman had her own history of being second choice.Had watched from the sidelines as someone else lived the life that might have been hers.

"Does she know you told me this?"

"Victoria knows everything that happens in these sessions." Her gaze was steady, penetrating. "Because you're ready to understand that the path forward isn't about what was taken from you. It's about what you choose to build from the wreckage."

With that, she closed her office door, leaving me alone in the dimly lit hallway, clutching the photos of my sister's stolen happiness against my chest like a shield. Each image a reminder of what they'd taken from me, and what I would take from them in return.
###Chapter 24

ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW

The law office of Berkman, Wade, and Associates smelled of leather, money, and superiority. I adjusted my black dress and studied the others in the conference room. Mom dabbed at her eyes with a monogrammed handkerchief. Dad stared blankly at the polished table. Stefan sat apart from us, face drawn and pale.

All of us performing our assigned roles. The grieving family. The heartbroken ex-husband. A perfect tableau of loss.

And why wouldn't we? Camille was dead. I knew that for certain. The men I'd hired hadn't just scared her as originally planned, they'd gone further, forcing her car off that bridge, watching it sink into the dark water.They'd called me afterward, panic in their voices. I'd paid them extra for their silence, then cut all contact.

Martin Greene entered, carrying a leather portfolio. Dad's longtime lawyer looked appropriately grave as he took a seat.

"Thank you all for coming," he said. "With the court having legally declared Camille deceased in absentia,we can now proceed with her last will and testament."

"Is this really necessary?" Mom asked, voice wavering. "It's only been six months."

"In cases of drowning where no body is recovered, the court can grant a death certificate after reasonable search efforts have concluded," Martin explained. "As Camille had significant independent assets that require disposition, the judge approved the declaration last week."

I kept my expression neutral, though my mind raced. Independent assets? What independent assets?

"I wasn't aware my sister had estate planning,"Isaid,injecting just the right note of confusion.

Martin opened his portfolio. "Camille updated her will last year, shortly after her twenty-fifth birthday. As you may recall, that was when she received her inheritance from her grandfather."

My blood froze. Grandfather Lewis. Dad's father. The crusty old man who had doted on Camille, his only biological grandchild, while largely ignoring me.

"What inheritance?" | asked sharply, then immediately softened my tone."I mean, she never mentioned receiving anything substantial."

Dad finally looked up. "My father left Camille a portion of his estate when she turned twenty-five. It was private,between them."

"How large a portion?" The question escaped before I could temper it.

Martin cleared his throat. "Mr. Lewis Senior established a trust for Camille valued at approximately thirty million dollars, along with the Cedar Hill estate."

The room spun around me. Thirty million dollars. Plus a mansion on twenty acres of prime land. And she had never said a word.

"That's impossible," I whispered."I would have known."

"Camille wanted it kept quiet," Dad said. "She said money changes how people see you."

Martin removed a document from his portfolio. "This is the last will and testament of Camille Elizabeth Lewis, revised and signed six months before her passing."

I leaned forward. Whatever secret fortune she'd hidden, it would surely come to her family now.To me,her only sister.

"To my parents, Richard and Margaret Lewis, I leave my collection of family photographs and my gratitude for the life they gave me."

Martin paused, glancing at my parents. Dad nodded stiffly. Mom's crying grew louder.

"To my sister, Rose Lewis, I leave my journal collection, in hopes she may come to understand me better in death than she did in life."
The journals. The ones I'd already taken and altered. A chill ran down my spine.

"To my former husband, Stefan Rodriguez, I return the engagement ring that belonged to his grandmother,with the hope that next time he gives it, it will be with honesty and true devotion."

Stefan flinched visibly. The ring had been a source of pride, a family heirloom that supposedly symbolized his commitment.

"As to the remainder of my estate, including all financial assets, investment accounts, personal property not specifically mentioned, the Cedar Hill estate, and the entire balance of the trust established by my grandfather, I direct that it be liquidated and the proceeds distributed as follows."

Here it was. The thirty million dollars and luxury estate that would surely be distributed among us.

"One hundred percent of said assets shall be donated to the Lighthouse Foundation for Abused and Abandoned Children, to establish the Camille Lewis Memorial Fund for the education and support of girls in the foster system."

The silence that followed was absolute. Even Mom's crying stopped abruptly.

"I'm sorry," I said, my voice unnaturally high,"but could you repeat that?"

Martin glanced up. "The entirety of Camille's estate, after specific bequests, is to be donated to the Lighthouse Foundation."

"That's not possible." The words burst from me. "There must be some mistake."

"There's no mistake, Ms. Lewis. The will is quite clear and legally binding."

"But..." I struggled to maintain composure. "That's thirty million dollars and a prime piece of real estate.Going to complete strangers. While her family gets nothing but photographs and... and journals?"

Martin withdrew an envelope. "She also left a letter to be read at this time, explaining her decisions."

Dad nodded his permission, his expression unreadable.

Martin broke the seal on the envelope and unfolded the letter within.
"To my family,'" he read. "'If you're hearing this, then I am gone, and you are now learning something i kept from all of you, that Grandfather left me a substantial inheritance when I turned twenty-five. I chose not to share this information, partly because I was still deciding how best to use such an unexpected blessing, but mostly because I needed to understand its power without influence from others.'"

I dug my fingernails into my palms. Even in presumed death, Camille was judging us.

"The money gave me freedom I never expected to have. Freedom to consider who I really was outside of other people's expectations and manipulations. Freedom to make choices based on my own values rather than seeking approval."

My gaze.flicked to Stefan, who looked physically ill. Had he known about the money when he signed those divorce papers?

"'| have chosen to direct my inheritance to help girls who lack the family support structure | was fortunate enough to have. The Lighthouse Foundation specifically assists young women transitioning from foster care to independent living. The Cedar Hill estate will be converted into a residential campus for their programs."

Something cold settled in my stomach. Foster care. Of all the charities, she'd selected one helping girls from the system I'd escaped. Was it coincidence, or had she somehow known?

"'To my parents, thank you for the security and opportunities you provided. This decision isn't a rejection of you, but rather an attempt to extend similar advantages to those without your resources."

Dad's jaw tightened. Mom resumed her quiet crying.

"'To Stefan, I've returned your grandmother's ring not out of bitterness, but because family legacies should continue with true commitment.!"

"'And to Rose, my sister by choice if not by blood, I leave my journals with hope rather than malice. In them,you'll find the unfiltered thoughts of someone who spent years trying to understand you, to love you despite the distance you maintained between us. Perhaps in reading them, you'll finally see me as I was, not as you needed me to be."
The blood drained from my face. *Sister by choice if not by blood. A pointed reminder of my adopted status.

"'I harbor no illusions that my modest fortune could have enhanced the lives of my already privileged family,but I believe it can transform the futures of dozens of young women who start with nothing. In this way,perhaps my departure might create meaning beyond grief."

Martin folded the letter. "It's signed, 'With complicated love, Camille."

The silence felt charged with my unspoken rage. Thirty million dollars. Gone. To strangers. To foster girls who would never appreciate it properly.①

"This can't be legal," I finally said. "She clearly wasn't in her right mind."

Martin raised an eyebrow. "The will was properly executed with witnesses who attested to her mental competence.The charitable intent is quite clear and legally sound."

"But we're her family," I insisted, looking to my parents for support. "Doesn't that count for anything?"

"Camille had every legal right to dispose of her property as she wished," Martin replied.

"We could contestsuggested, turning to Dad. "Argue undue influence or something."

Dad finally spoke, his voice tired. "Rose, enough. Camille made her choice. We will respect it."

"But Dad..."

"I said enough. My daughter is dead. I won't dishonor her memory by fighting over money none of us need."

Mom reached for his hand. "Richard is right. This is what Camille wanted. Perhaps it will help us find meaning in her loss."

I stared at them in disbelief. Were they seriously accepting this?

"Stefan?" | turned to him, seeking an ally."Don't you have anything to say?"

He looked up slowly. "What is there to say? Camille made her wishes clear." HHe gave a bitter laugh. "At least I get the ring back. Small comfort."
Martin cleared his throat. "The transfer process has already begun. The Lighthouse Foundation has been notified, though the public announcement will wait until the family has had time to process this privately."

As we prepared to leave, I noticed Dr. Elena Reyes, director of the Lighthouse Foundation, waiting in the reception area.

"I won't intrude on your family's grief," she said softly. "I only wanted to express how Camille's generosity will change lives. The girls in our program face nearly impossible odds, and this gift will provide opportunities they could never have imagined."

Mom stepped forward, taking the woman's hands in hers. "Would you tell me about your program sometime? I'd like to know more about what Camille was supporting."

In the elevator, I maintained my composure with effort. "I still think we should consider contesting the will.For Camille's sake. She clearly wasn't thinking clearly."

Dad's expression hardened. "Drop it, Rose. The money and property were never yours to begin with. Camille made her choice, and we will honor it."

"But-"

"I said drop it. I've lost my daughter. I won't lose my integrity too by fighting over her wishes."

The elevator doors opened, ending the conversation.

I declined the offer to ride home with my parents. In my own car, with the privacy screen raised, I finally let my mask slip, slamming my fist against the leather seat.

Thirty million dollars and the Cedar Hill estate. The amounts kept repeating in my mind like a taunt. Assets Camille had hidden from me. Wealth that should have been mine. Money now flowing to unwashed,uncultured foster brats who would never deserve it the way I did.

I, who had survived the system through cunning and determination. I, who had clawed my way into the Lewis family through careful study and perfect performance. I, who had spent fourteen years proving my superiority over their biological daughter.
And now, the final insult, Camille's money going to help girls from the very background I'd fought so desperately to escape and conceal.

The journals sat beside me, a mocking reminder of her final message.*lnhope rather than malice*. As if she'd somehow known I would take them. As if she'd anticipated my every move.

But she couldn't have. The real Camille had been naive, trusting, easily manipulated. This will had likely been written in a moment of misguided altruism, not calculated revenge.

Unless...

What if Camille had updated her will after discovering I and Stefan's affair before her death? After beginning to see through my manipulations?

What if the money had originally been intended for me, and she'd changed her mind upon discovering my betrayal?

###Chapter 25

ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW

I slammed my apartment door so hard the walls shook. The sound echoed through the empty space,matching the thunder in my heart. My hands shook as I poured myself a drink, spilling expensive whiskey on the marble counter.

"Damn you, Camille," I whispered, then screamed it:"DAMN YOU!"

The crystal glass flew from my hand, shattering against the wall in a spray of amber liquid and broken dreams.Thirty million dollars. The Cedar Hill estate. All of it gone to those worthless foster kids.

My legs gave out and I slid to the kitchen floor, surrounded by the mess I'd made. Just like my life -everything perfect on the surface, chaos underneath. And now Camille, sweet, stupid Camille,had managed to ruin everything even from the grave.

"You think you're so clever, don't you?" I spoke to the empty air, imagining her ghost watching me fall apart."Little Miss Perfect wwith her secret fortune. Did you laugh about it? Did you enjoy knowing you had something I didn't?"

I grabbed another glass, hurled it across the room. The crash brought a sick satisfaction.

"All those years I spent making you feel small," I continued, stalking through my perfect apartment like a caged animal. "Making you doubt yourself. Making you think you weren't enough. And all along you were sitting on millions!"

My reflection caught my eye - designer dress, perfect makeup, not a hair out of place even in my rage. The mask I'd worn for so long it had become my face. With a cry of pure fury, I grabbed a decorative vase and smashed the mirror.

The glass splintered, creating a dozen fractured versions of my face. Each one a different mask I'd worn.
The perfect daughter. The loving sister. The secret lover. The hidden survivor of the foster system.

"You knew, didn't you?" | accused my broken reflection. "That's why you left the money to them. You figured out what I really was. Where I really came from."@

The thought sent me into a fresh frenzy. I tore through the apartment like a hurricane, destroying everything in my path. Ripped designer clothes from their hangers. Overturned furniture. Shredded the fancy artwork I'd chosen to match my carefully crafted image.

"I EARNED THIS!" I screamed, throwing a chair through my floor-to-ceiling windows. The glass cracked but didn't break - safety-rated, of course. Even my destruction had limits. "I clawed my way out of nothing! I made myself perfect! I deserved that money more than any of them!"

My hands found a framed photo - me and Camille at my fashion show launch. Her arm around my waist,both of us smiling. Both of us lying. I studied her face in the picture, searching for signs she'd known her death was coming. That she'd suspected what I'd done.

"I didn't mean for them to kill you,"Iwhispered to her frozen smile. "Just scare you. Make you run away.Sign those divorce papers. But you had to be stubborn, didn't you? Had to fight back. And now look what happened."③

The frame joined the pile of broken glass on my imported marble floors. Thousands of dollars in destroyed luxury items scattered around me like fallen soldiers in my private war.

I found myself in my home office, yanking open drawers until I found what I wanted-the stack of Camille's journals. The ones I'd stolen and doctored after her"death," planting false entries about her depression and suicidal thoughts. Insurance against any investigation.

"'To Rose, my sister by choice if not by blood," I mimicked her words from the will reading. "'I leave my journals with hope rather than malice.!' Hope for what, Camille? Hope I'd confess? Hope I'd feel guilty?"

I flipped through the pages I'd so carefully forged, my handwriting a perfect match for hers. So many hours spent practicing her style, just like I'd spent years practicing being the perfect daughter, the perfect sister.Always practicing, always performing.

"You don't know what it's like," Itold the journals, my voice breaking."TOhave nothing. To be nothing. To know that one wrong move means going back to that place."

The memory of the foster home rose up - the smell of too many unwashed bodies, the sound of crying in the night, the constant fear of being sent somewhere worse. I'd promised myself I'd never go back. I'd do anything to stay in this perfect world I'd built.

"I did what I had to do," I said, but the words sounded hollow even to me. "I earned my place here. Those other girls, they're weak. They'll never appreciate what you gave them. They'll waste it, just like they waste every chance they get."

But even as I said it, I knew it wasn't true. I'd been one of those girls once. Before I learned to hide my past.Before I convinced the Lewis family to adopt me. Before I made myself into someone who belonged in their world.

My rage drained suddenly, leaving me empty. I looked around at my ruined apartment - broken glass everywhere,furniture overturned, clothes scattered like fallen leaves. The perfect image destroyed, just like my perfect plan.

"You win, Camille," I whispered, slumping against the wall. "Even in death, you finally win. You found the one thing I couldn't take from you. The one way to hurt me that I never saw coming."

The journals fell from my limp fingers, pages spilling across the floor. My careful forgeries, my attempted manipulations of the truth, all useless now. The money was gone. The estate was gone. Everything I'd thought I deserved, given to the very people I'd spent my life trying to forget.

But something else nagged at me, a worry I couldn't shake. Camille had been smarter than I'd given her credit for. She'd hidden her inheritance, updated her will, left those pointed messages in the legal documents. What else had she known? What else had she planned for?

The thought chilled me. I'd underestimated her before, thought her too naive to suspect my affair with Stefan, too trusting to fight back when I sent those men after her. I'd been wrong then. Could I be wrong now?

My phone buzzed - a text from Stefan: *We need to talk about what happened today.*

I ignored it. Stefan was a loose end I'd deal with later. Right now, I needed to think. To plan. To figure out if Camille had left any other surprises waiting to explode in my carefully constructed life.

"This isn't over,"|told the empty apartment, my voice steady again. "You might have won this round,sister dear, but I'm not finished yet. I've come too far, fought too hard, to let your ghost destroy everything I've built."

I stood up, brushing glass from my dress. Time to call my cleaning service, erase the evidence of my breakdown. Time to put the mask back on, be perfect Rose again. But first...

I gathered the scattered journal pages, struck a match, and watched them burn in my marble sink. No evidence. No loose ends. No weakness.

"Goodbye, Camille," I whispered as the flames consumed my forged confessions. "Thanks for teaching me one last lesson-never underestimate the dead."

As I watched the ashes swirl down the drain, a new thought struck me. If Camille had been clever enough to hide her millions, what else might she have hidden? What other secrets had my perfect, naive sister taken to her watery grave?

The question haunted me as I began cleaning up the mess I'd made. Each piece of broken glass felt like. a fragment of my carefully constructed world, crumbling beneath the weight of Camille's final revenge.

And somewhere, in the back of my mind, a small voice whispered: What if she isn't really dead at all?
###Chapter 26

STEFAN'S POINT OF VIEW

The bourbon burned down my throat, a welcome fire against the cold emptiness spreading through my chest.I signaled the bartender for another. My fourth? Fifth? I'd lost count hours ago.

"You sure about that, buddy?" he asked, eyeing the empty glasses.

"Just pour the damn drink," I growled.

The alcohol couldn't drown the words that had haunted me all day: Martin Greene reading Camille's will, her final message cutting through me like a blade.

*"To my former husband, Stefan Rodriguez, I return the engagement ring that belonged to his grandmother,with the hope that next timne he gives it, it will be with honesty and true devotion."*②

The ring sat heavy in my pocket, retrieved from the safety deposit box this morning. Grandmother Rosa's ring. Three generations of Rodriguez women had worn it before I'd placed it on Camile's finger, promising forever with words that turned to ash in my mouth.

Thirty million dollars and the Cedar Hill estate. All of it to charity. Not a penny to her family. Nothing to Rose.Nothing to me. Everything to help girls who had no one else to turn to.

That was Camille. Always giving. Always thinking of others. Even in death.

My phone vibrated again. Rose. Her sixth call tonight. I silenced it without answering. Couldn't talk to her.Not after watching calculation rather than grief cross her face at the will reading. All she cared about was the money she wasn't getting.

Had I really left Camille for that? For someone who couldn't even fake proper sadness at her own sister's generosity?
 The night air hit me like a slap as I stumbled out of the bar. I started walking, no destination in mind, until l found myself at Riverside Park, where Camille and I had spent countless Sunday afternoons during our first year together.

Before Rose came back from London. Before everything changed.

I sank onto a bench overlooking the water, the same river that had swallowed Camille's car. Her body never found. Just a shoe, months later. A single, waterlogged reminder of the woman I'd discarded.

From my pocket, I withdrew the ring box. The diamond caught what little light penetrated the park's darkness,winking at me like it knew all my secrets.

"I'm sorry," I whispered to thne night, to Camille's ghost. "I'm so damn sorry."

My phone buzzed. Rose again.

"Where are you?" Her voice sharp with irritation.

"Out."

"You're drunk. Come over. We need to talk about what happened today."

"No." The word felt strange in my mouth. Had I ever denied Rose anything before?

"She did it to spite us," Rose hissed. "To punish us from beyond the grave."

The laugh that escaped me sounded more lie a sob.that what you think? She was your sister, Rose.She loved you.Even after everything, she loved you."

I ended the call and turned off my phone. The alcohol had reached that treacherous plateau where emotions amplify rather than dull.

A memory surfaced: Camille on our first date, describing her dreams of working with disadvantaged youth."Everyone deserves a chance," she'd said, eyes bright with conviction. "Especially kids who start with nothing."

I'd nodded along, pretending her passion moved me when really I was just calculating how long until I could reasonably suggest we go back to my place. God, I'd been shallow then.Had I ever truly seen her?

The realization hit me with physical force. I'd left the one person who truly loved me for someone incapable of loving anyone but herself.

Dawn found me at the Rodriguez family mausoleum. Inside, I traced the engraved letters of Camille's memorial plaque, added despite my father's objections that she wasn't "blood."

"I got your message," I said to the empty air. "With the ring. You're right. I wasn't honest. Wasn't devoted.Never deserved you."

I sank to the cold floor, grandmother's ring clutched in my fist. "You gave everything to those girls. Never told anyone about your inheritance, just quietly planned how to use it to help others." My voice cracked."That's who you always were. And I threw you away for what? For Rose? For excitement?"

Hours later, I found myself outside the Lighthouse Foundation. Camille's charity. The organization she'd left her fortune to. Young women entered and exited, some with hard eyes and defensive postures, others with tentative hope.

Inside, I met Dr. Elena Reyes, the director. She showed me the plans for Cedar Hill - a sanctuary for foster girls, carefully designed under Camille's guidance before her death.

"She wanted to create somewhere these young women could find not just practical help but emotional safety," Dr. Reyes explained. "Many of them have never known what that feels like."

"I'd like to help," I heard myself say. "Financially. Professionally. However I can."

"May I ask why?"

The question stripped me bare. "Because it's what Camille wanted. Because it matters. Because maybe I can do one thing right, even if it's too late for her to see it."

Dr. Reyes studied me carefully. "Camille spoke often about second chances. About how everyone deserves the opportunity to become their best self. I think that included you, even at the end."

Outside again, my phone buzzed with messages from Rose and my father. The world I'd built, demanding I return to my place in it. For the first time in my privileged life, I faced a choice that actually mattered.

Return to the path I'd been walking, the path of least resistance, of shallow pleasures and empty achievements. The path that led to Rose, to becoming my father, to living and dying without ever touching what was real.

Or step off that smooth, well-lit road onto something unknown but meaningful. Something that honoredthe woman I'd discarded, the love I'd taken for granted.

I couldn't undo what I'd done to Camille. CouIdn't rewrite our ending. Couldn't deserve, even in death,the love she'd offered in life.

But maybe, just maybe, I could become someone who would have been worthy of her. Someone who gave instead of took. Someone who built instead of destroyed.

As I walked through the city that suddenly seemed full of possibilities I'd never considered, I made a silent promise to the woman I'd lost. The woman who, even in death, had shown me a better way to live.

I would become someone she could have been proud of. Someone who deserved the ring in my pocket.Someone who understood, finally,what mattered.

And I would start today.
###Chapter 27

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW

"Neurix Technologies," Victoria said, sliding the folder across her desk. "Twenty-seven employees.
Promising neural interface technology. Currently entertaining acquisition offers."

"And?" I asked, waiting for the catch. With Victoria, there was always a catch.

"And you'll be handling the acquisition." She leaned back, expression unreadable. "Alone."

My heart stuttered. After eight months of shadowing Victoria at Kane Industries, this was my first real test.

"Their valuation?"

"They're asking ninety million. They're worth sixty-five, at most. I want them for fifty."

"When do negotiations begin?"

"Two hours. The meeting is set for eleven at our downtown offices."

My head snapped up. "Today? You're giving me two hours to prepare?"

A small, cold smile played at her mouth. "In business, opportunities rarely announce themselves weeks in advance. Besides, you've had eight months of preparation."

"Who am I negotiating against?"

"Marcus Whitfield."

The name hit me like a physical blow. Whitfield, legendary venture capitalist, notorious for destroying less experienced negotiators.

In my suite, I changed into a power suit, charcoal gray pinstripe, crisp white blouse, three-inch heels.The woman in the mirror looked confident, capable, born to command respect.

A perfect illusion.

The executive conference room was already set up when I arrived.Through the glass walls, I saw the Neurix team and Whitfield-tall, broad-shouldered, emanating authority.

The introductions blurred past. Dr. Morris, Neurix CEO. His team. And WhitfieId, whose handshake came with assessing eyes that told me everything. He was surprised to see me, not Victoria. An easier target.

For thirty minutes, I led a technical discussion about their patents and milestones, highlighting weaknesses.Morris and his team grew increasingly uncomfortable.

Then Whitfield struck.

"Axiom is offering eighty-five million," Morris blurted. "With twenty percent contingent on Phase II results."

"We're prepared to offer sixty-five million, all cash, no contingencies," I countered.

Whitfield's smile was thin. "Sixty-five versus eighty-five? No contest. And frankly, I'm surprised Victoria sent you with such an unprepared position."

The mention of Victoria stung exactly as he'd intended. He was playing me now, not just the Neurix team.

The situation spiraled. Victoria's target price seemed impossible. Even seventy million looked unrealistic.

"Wait," I said desperately. "Kane can offer seventy-five million. All cash. No contingencies."

The words hung in the air. I had no authority to make that offer.

"Eighty," I added, going all in. "Eighty million, final offer."

But it was too late. Morris signed with Axiom. Right there in Kane Industries' own conference room.

"Send Victoria my regards," Whitfield said quietly as he left. "And a word of advice-next time, she might want to handle important negotiations herself."

Four hours later, I stood in Victoria's office,waiting for judgment.
"Explain," she said.

"I failed," I said simply. "Whitfield outmaneuvered me at every turn."

"You offered eighty million for a company I valued at fifty."

"Yes."

"Why?"

"Because I panicked. Because I wasn't prepared to waIk away with nothing."

"All true," she agreed. "And all inexcusable."

The word cut deeper than any physical pain from my combat training.

"I set you up to fail," Victoria continued, her tone unchanged. "Deliberately."

I blinked."What?"

"I chose Neurix specifically because I knew Whitfield was representing Axiom's bid. I gave you impossible parameters. I wanted to see how you would handle absolute failure."

"This was a test?"

"Everything is a test, Camille. I thought you understood that by now."

"Then why?"

"Because in real battle, you don't get to choose your conditions. Rose won't fight fair when the time comes.She'll use every advantage, every dirty trick. I needed to see how you perform when everythingis against you."

The logic was brutally sound, but the humiliation remained, burning in my chest.

"And how did I perform?"

"Poorly," she said without hesitation. "You lost composure. You made emotional decisions. You allowed Whitfield to manipulate your fear of disappointing me."
"But," Victoria continued, "you didn't break. You didn't run. You came back to face the consequences.That's something."

She moved to the window. "When I first started building Kane Industries, I lost a major contract negotiation.My first real opportunity, squandered through inexperience."

"What did you do?"

"I identified every mistake. Studied them. Ensured I would never repeat them." She turned back. "Then I went after the next opportunity with twice the preparation."

"And did you succeed?"

"No. I failed again. But differently. New mistakes. More sophisticated errors. Until eventually, success became the expectation, not the exception." Her gaze was measuring. "That's what separates winners from losers, Camille. Not whether they fail, but what they do with that failure."

Something shifted inside me. The humiliation was still there, but beside it grew something harder.A cold certainty that I would never allow myself to be outmaneuvered like that again.

"What happens now?" |asked.

"Now you document every mistake. Study them. Learn from them. And prepare for your next test."

"Which is?"

"Not yet determined. But rest assured, it will come when you least expect it. When you're most vulnerable.Just like today."

Just like life. Just like revenge.

As I walked toward Dr. Reed's office later, something crystallized inside me. Victoria had engineered today's failure as a forging fire, heating the metal of my character to shape it into something stronger, sharper.

Rose had spent years undermining me, ensuring I remained weak and pliable. Today's humiliation was just one more step in becoming someone she would never recognize. Someone she could never again manipulate or defeat.
Next time, I wouldn't be the one walking away empty-handed. Next time, I would be the predator, not the prey.

And there would be no mercy.

*********

The glass shattered against my bedroom wall, water splashing across expensive wallpaper. The sound wasn't enough to match the storm inside me. I grabbed a crystal paperweight from my desk and hurled it at the mirror. Cracks spiderwebbed across my reflection, fracturing my image into dozens of broken pieces.

"Ms. Kane?" A knock at my door. Security staff, doing their rounds.everything alright?"

"Fine," I called back, voice steady despite the chaos surrounding me. "Just dropped something."

"Do you need assistance?"

"No.Leave me alone."

I sank onto my bed, staring at the fractured mirror image. Not quite Camille Lewis anymore. Not fully Camille Kane yet.Caught between identities, between failure and redemption. The drive home from Victoria's office replayed in my mind, James's professional silence, my rigid posture, the weight of humiliation pressing down on my shoulders.

Victoria would still be at dinner with Barrett, smoothly negotiating the deal I'd destroyed. Showing him what real business acumen looked like while I hid in my room throwing things like a child.

My phone buzzed. Victoria: "Deal closed. Terms favorable. Full debrief tomorrow, 7 AMM."

No mention of my failure, No reassurance. Just business, moving forward despite my misstep. The world continued turning, deals continued closing, money continued flowing. With or without my successful participation.

I moved to my bathroom, studying myself in the unbroken mirror there. Eight months of training had transformed me physically. My body was lean and strong from Jason's combat lessons. My face refined by Dr. Torres's work. My appearance crafted to project power and authority.
But none of it mattered if the woman beneath these changes remained weak. If I still retreated when challenged, still doubted myself when pushed, still buckled under pressure.

A soft knock interrupted my thoughts. "Ms. Kane?" Mrs. Chen, the housekeeper. "I've brought your evening tea."

I hesitated, not wanting anyone to see the evidence of my outburst. But hiding the mess would be hiding from my failure.

"Come in."

Mrs. Chen entered, her eyes taking in the destruction before returning to professional neutrality. Eight months in Victoria Kane's household had taught her discretion.

"Your chamomile tea," she said, setting the tray down as if nothing were amiss. "With honey, as you prefer."

"Thank you." I made no excuses for the mess. Just accepted the service as my due. As Victoria would.

"If I may, Ms. Kane..." she paused at the door. "Even Ms. Victoria sometimes breaks things. The difference is, she makes sure to aim better next time."

The comment jarred me from self-pity. Victoria Kane, breaking things? The woman who embodied control and precision? It seemed impossible.

I moved to my desk and opened my laptop. Time to shift from emotional reaction to analytical response.Victoria would expect my complete breakdown of the failed negotiation tomorrow morning.

For hours | typed, capturing every moment of the meeting with Barrett. Where had I misread the situation?What signals had I missed? How had he seen through my careful facade to the insecurity beneath?

By dawn, I'd finished two documents. The first: a clinical analysis of every business mistake. The second: a deeper examination of my emotional vulnerabilities during the negotiation. More honest. More revealing of the gap between appearance and reality.

The broken glass remained untouched as | dressed for my meeting with Victoria. My reflection in the bathroom mirror showed dark circles under my eyes, carefully concealed. No physical evidence of weakness would be visible today.

Victoria stood at her office window when I arrived, silhouetted against the morning light. She didn't turn asl entered.

"I reviewed your analysis," she said. "The second document was more interesting. More honest than 「expected."

"Lying to myself about yesterday's failure would only garantee its repetition."

"Your assessment of your emotional state was particularly revealing. The way Barrett triggered your old insecurities with a few carefully chosen words and expressions."

"He read me too easily."

"Because you still wear those insecurities like a second skin." Victoria's voice was unsparing. "Eight months of training have changed your external presentation but not your internal landscape."

"How do I change that?"

Victoria studied me. "You begin by recognizing that your past experiences aren't universal truths. They're data points that shaped your perception. Your sister undermined you. Your husband betrayed you.Your parents overlooked you. These experiences shaped how you see yourself, how you expect others to see you."

"And I need to forget those experiences?"

"No. You need to recognize they're historical, not predictive." She leaned forward. "Barrett expected you to retreat because that's what your history conditioned you to do. Your sister expects the same. The power lies in doing the unexpected."

Victoria moved to a cabinet and withdrew a photograph, setting it between us.

"My first major,business failure," she said. "Thirty years ago. I lost a hundred-million-dollar acquisition to a competitor because I miscalculated their financing capacity."

The photo showed a younger Victoria beside William Hargrove, both smiling with champagne glasses "This was taken the day after that failure, when I secured a two-hundred-million-dollar deal that made the previous loss irrelevant."

"What happened between the loss and this victory?"

"I spent one hour destroying my office. Broke every piece of glass. Threw a paperweight through my window." Her lips curved slightly. "Then I spent twenty-three hours creating a strategy that would make everyone forget my failure."

The revelation stunned me. Victoria Kane, controlled, calculating, seemingly untouchable, had once demolished her own office in rage. Had channeled that fury into strategic brilliance.

"That's what I mean by aiming better," she continued. "Emotional reactions have their place. But they must serve a purpose, not merely release tension."

I straightened in my chair. "I want to set up a simulation room. Bring in professional actors to recreate high-pressure scenarios.People trained to use the same tactics Barrett employed."

Victoria's expression sharpened. "Elaborate."

"We use simulated negotiations, but they're too controlled. I need to be blindsided, forced to respond to unexpected psychological triggers. If I can maintain control when deliberately provoked, I can handle anyone in real business."

"Your timing is premature. You're not ready."

"I wasn't ready for Barrett either," I countered. "Yet you put me in that room, knowing failure was possible."

Victoria fell silent, her expression unreadable. Finally, she reached for her tablet.

"Three months," she said. "You'll meet with Rose in exactly three months, after you've closed the MicroLink competitor acquisition. The meeting will be strictly controlled. You'll present as a minor associate from Kane Ventures."

Relief and anxiety washed through me. She was agreeing-with conditions, butagreeing.
"By the time you sit across from your sister," Victoria continued, "you will be unrecognízable not just physically but fundamentally. The woman she knew will be completely erased, replaced by someone she cannot manipulate, cannot understand, cannot defeat."

"What about Barrett? He's already dismissed me as incompetent."

"You don't handle it. You use it. His underestimation creates strategic advantage. When you negotiate with his competitor, they'll expect an easy victory. Their overconfidence will be their downfall."

She checked her watch. "Now you have fifteen minutes to prepare for your first modified training session with Jason. He's incorporating psychological triggers into your combat scenarios, as you suggested."

I stood, recognizing the dismissal."Thank you for seeing potential beyond my failure."

Victoria looked up. "Failure is data, Camille. Nothing more. Nothing less. How you use that data determines your future."

As I moved toward the door, she added, "And have Maintenance repair your mirror. Broken reflections serve no purpose except to distort your self-perception. You need clear vision for the path ahead."

*******

The elevator descended to the training facility where Jason waited. Three months to prepare for two critical tests, the business acquisition that would redeem my professional reputation, and the meeting with Rose that would prove my personal transformation.

Three months to complete my transformation from victim to victor. From prey to predator. From broken to unbreakable.

"Heard you had a rough day yesterday," Jason said as I entered.

"Yesterday is data," I replied, stepping onto the mat. "Today is application."

His eyebrow raised, but he nodded with approval."Good. Because today's going to hurt in ways you haven't experienced yet."

I smiled, a small, fierce expression that felt unfamiliar. "I'm counting on it."
###Chapter 28

ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW

"You've been distant lately," I said, stirring my coffee with practiced precision. Three clockwise turns, no more, no less. Morning sunlight streamed through the windows of Stefan's penthouse, our penthouse now,though I maintained my own apartment for appearance's sake.

Eight months since Camille's "death." Eight months of nurturing Stefan through grief, providing just enough comfort to keep him dependent without allowing him to fully heal. A delicate balance, but one I'd mastered through years of subtle manipulation.

Stefan looked up from his newspaper, dark circles beneath his eyes betraying another sleepless night."Have I? Sorry. Work's been demanding."

A lie. His family company practically ran itself, generations of wealth ensuring he needed to do little more than show up for board meetings and sign occasional papers. No, what kept him awake wasn't work but guilt. The gift that kept giving.

"I worry about you," I reached across the table, taking his hand in mine. "You're still punishing yourself over things you can't change."

He flinched slightly at the gentle accusation, eyes darting away from mine. "It's not that simple, Rose."

"Isn't it? Camille is gone." I softened my voice, the perfect blend of compassion and practicality. wouldn't want you torturing yourself like this."

Stefan pulled his hand back, jaw tightening. "You don't know what she would want."

Actually, I did. My pathetic sister had wanted precisely what I'd taken from her, Stefan, our parents'approval, social standing, success. But pointing that out wouldn't serve my current purpose.
"You're right," I conceded, allowing a hint of hurt to enter my voice. "I just hate seeing you suffer."

He sighed, immediately guilty for snapping at me. Predictable. Stefan's need to be the good guy, the gentleman, made him so easy to steer. Show the slightest wound, and he'd bend over backward to heal it.

"I'm sorry," he said, taking my hand again. "I know you're trying to help. It's just... hard sometimes."

"Of course it is." I gave him the smile | reserved for moments like this, understanding, patient, supportive.The smile that said I would wait forever for him to heal, to be whole again. The smile that was the biggest lie of all.

Because I didn't want him healed. I didn't want him whole. I wanted him broken just enough to be pliable.Strong enough to be useful, weak enough to be controlled.

"I have an idea," I said, brightening as if the thought had just occurred to me. In reality, I'd planned this conversation for weeks, waiting for the perfect morning to execute it. "Let's get away this weekend.The Hampton house is empty. Just us, the beach, no reminders of... everything."

Stefan hesitated, and I could read his thoughts as clearly as if they were projected on his forehead.A weekend away meant intimacy.Commitment.Moving forward. Steps he'd been reluctant to take despite our now-public relationship.

"I have that charity thing Saturday," he offered weakly.

"Reschedule." I kept my tone light, but with a firmness that suggested disappointment at his resistance."The children with cancer will understand if you help them next weekend instead."

The jab landed perfectly. His face flushed with shame at the implied selfishness of choosing a charity event over quality time with me.

"You're right," he agreed, already reaching for his phone. "I'll have my assistant rearrange things."

Victory. Small but significant. One more crack in the wall of guilt that had kept him emotionally distant these past months.

"Perfect. I'll pack for both of us." I stood, dropping a kiss on his forehead. "I have meetings all day, but I'll be backtonight to help you finish those board reports."

Another calculated move. Stefan hated the quarterly reports his father insistedI he complete personally. By offering help, I reminded him of my value beyond the emotional. I was partner, assistant, lover, friend,everything he needed in one perfectly packaged woman.

The afternoon brought a message from him: *Ring is ready. Don't peek if you go by the jeweler's

The winking emoji, so unlike his usual formal texting style, confirmed my success. He was feeling playful,romantic even. The emotional distance dissolving precisely on schedule.

I replied with calculated enthusiasm: *No spoilers please! So excited for our weekend away	*

Just enough girlish anticipation to flatter him, not enough to seem desperate. The perfect balance I'd maintained throughout our relationship.

The Hamptons house belonged to Stefan's family, a sprawling beachfront property where we'd spent time together years ago, before I'd orchestrated his marriage to Camille. The place held memories for us,manufactured ones on my part, genuine on his.

I'd arranged everything, private chef for Friday night, horseback riding Saturday morning (Stefan's favorite activity, one Camille had always been too afraid to join), sunset cruise that evening. Sunday would bring a carefully curated brunch followed by a walk on the beach where, if all went.according to plan, Stefan would finally propose.

The house looked perfect when we arrived, fresh flowers in every room, champagne chilling, gourmet snacks arranged artfully in the kitchen. Stefan whistled appreciatively as we entered the great room with its soaring ceilings and wall of windows facing the Atlantic.

"They've outdone themselves," he remarked, setting down our bags. "Almost like they were expecting a special occasion."

I kept my expression neutrally pleased. "Your family always maintains impeccable standards. One of the things I love about the Rodriguez way."

The afternoon passed in comfortable luxury, champagne on the deck, a walk along the private beach,
preparations for the dinner I'd arranged. Stefan grew increasingly nervous as evening approached, checking his pocket periodically, excusing himself to make phone calls Ipretended not to recognize as consultations with friends about the impending proposal.

Dinner was served on the deck, ocean waves providing perfect background music, sunset painting the sky in colors that seemed arranged specifically for this moment. The chef had prepared all Stefan's favorites,seafood appetizer, perfectly cooked steak, chocolate dessert that complemented the red wine.

"Shall we walk along the shore?" Stefan suggested afterward, voice slightly higher than normal."Beautiful night for it."

We strolled hand-in-hand down the wooden steps to the beach, shoes left behind, waves lapping gently at our feet. The full moon created a silver path across the water, nature's own engagement backdrop.

Stefan stopped at precisely the spot l'd anticipated, turning to face me. "Rose..."

"Yes?" I kept my expression open, expectant.

"These past months..." He paused, gahering himself. "These past months have been impossible in so many ways.Losing Camille. The guilt. The pain. I couldn't havei survived without you."

I remained silent, allowing him his prepared speech. The moonlight cast half his face in shadow, making him look older, more serious than the boy I'd first targeted years ago.

"I know it's complicated," he continued. "I know people will talk. But life is too short to deny what's real.What's always been real between us."

He reached into his pocket, withdrawing the small velvet box. My heart quickened despite knowing exactly what was coming. Victory, at last.

"I should have done this years ago," Stefan said, voice steadying as he dropped to one knee."Before London. Before everything got so complicated. I should have followed my heart from the beginning."

The box opened to reveal Grandmother Rosa's ring, diamond catching moonlight in brilliant flashes. Stefan had indeed had it sized, the band altered to fit my finger rather than Camille's.
"Rose Lewis," he said, looking up at me with an earnestness that almost, almost touched something in my carefully guarded heart. "Will you marry me?"

The moment stretched between us, ocean waves punctuating the silence. I could practically hear the tumblers falling into place, the locked door of my ambition finally opening to reveal the prize beyond.

I allowed tears to fill my eyes, not difficult to manufacture given the magnitude of my achievement. Let my hands tremble slightly as they reached for his face.

whispered. "Stefan, yes. Always yes."

His smile blazed with relief and joy as he slid the ring onto my finger. The weight of it, the tangible symbol of my victory, sent a rush of satisfaction through me.

Later that night, as Stefan slept peacefully beside me, mny phone lit up with a message from Jenny:*Confirmation from Kane Industries the meeting is for next Tuesday. Their representative, Her daughter Camille Kane, will not be in attendance so they sent another person instead, arrive at 2 PM sharp.*

I frowned slightly. Victoria Kane's recently revealed adopted daughter. The mysterious heiress who had appeared out of nowhere last year, featured in business publications but rarely photographed clearly. An unknown factor in my carefully controlled world.

No matter. By Tuesday, I would be officially engaged to Stefan Rodriguez, wearing his grandmother's ring,planning our life together. Whatever this Kane wanted to discuss about investing in my business would simply be icing on an already perfect cake.

I returned to bed, curling against Stefan's sleeping form, the ring catching moonlight as I settled my hand possessively on his chest. Everything had gone according to plan. Everything had fallen into place.

Why, then, did I dream that night of drowning? Of water filling my lungs as I sank into darkness? Of a familiar face watching from above, not with Camille's usual forgiveness, but with something new, something dangerous.

Something that looked remarkably like vengeance.
###Chapter 29

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW

The engagement party filled the screen before me, bright lights and beautiful people swirling in celebration.I sat motionless in Victoria's guest suite, hands folded in my lap, breathing measured despite the storm in my chest. Three cameras captured the event from different angles, ensuring not a single moment of joy would go undocumented.

Joy for them. Torture for me.

The Rodriguez family estate had been transformed into a fairytale setting, white roseseverywhere,crysta chandeliers hanging from pavilions, string quartet playing softly. Two hundred guests in designer formal wear,champagne flowing freely, laughter rising into the night air.

And at the center of it all, Rose and Stefan. My sister and my ex-husband.

"The engagement of the year," the entertainment reporter gushed. "Stefan Rodriguez, heir to the Rodriguez shipping fortune, and renowned fashion designer Rose Lewis have finally made their relationship official after a respectful period following the tragic death of Stefan's first wife-Rose's sister Camille."②

A "respectful period." Nine months. That's all it took for my existence to become a footnote in their love story.

The camera cut to my mother, diamonds glittering at her throat. "Of course we're thrilled," she said, voice slightly too bright. "Rose and Stefan have always had a special connection. While we continue to mourn Camille,we know she would want them to find happiness."

Would I? Would I want them to find happiness together? To build their life on the foundation of my destruction?

A tear slid down my cheek before I could stop it. I wiped it away quickly, angry at this weakness. Eleven months of transformation. Eleven months of becoming someone new. Someone stronger.

The door opened slertly. Victoria Froved to stand beside my char, her attention fixing on the television where Rose was riow tossing her bouquet.

"You requested the broadcast,"Victoria sard, her voice rieutral

" needed to see it," I teplied, steadier than expected. "To understand what P'm fighting for,"

Victoria studied me, missing nothing, not the dried tears, not the tension in my shoulders. "And what did you discover?"

"That I've been fighting the wrong battle,"|said softly.been preparing to take back what they stole from me. My husband. My family. My life."

I turned to face her fully, something shifting inside me like tectonic plates rearranging. "But that life was.never worth fighting for. Stefan never loved me, not really. My parents never saw me, not clearly. Rose never considered me her sister, only an obstacle."

I moved to the window overlooking Manhattan's glittering expanse. A view fitting for who I was becoming.Not Camille Lewis, forgotten daughter and discarded wife. But Camille Kane,heir to an empire, architect of vengeance.

"For eleven months, I've been training to reclaim what I lost,"Icontinued. "But what I lost wasn't worth having."

"Then what are you fighting for?" Victoria asked.

"Justice," I said, the word tasting new on my tongue. Not revenge, something hotter, more primal. But justice, cold, measured, inexorable."I'm fighting to show them exactly who they are. To make them face the truth they've spent a lifetime avoiding."

"And what truth is that?"

"That Rose isn't the golden child they think she is. That Stefan isn't the honorable man he pretends to be.That my parents chose wrongly when they favored her over me." My words emerged with quiet certainty.
"They built thelr happiness on lies. Justice is showing them their foundation is sand."

Victoria moved to the desk, opening folders, dossiers on Rose's fashion business, Stefan's role in his family company, my parents' social connections. Eleven months of intelligence gathering, creating a map of vulnerabilities.

"The acquisition of TechVault goes public tomorrow," Victoria said. "Your redemptionin the business world.Then we begin the systematic dismantling of their world. Not with a frontal assault, but with precision strikes they won't recognize as attacks until it's too late."

She outlined the plan. Acquiring Rose's main fabric supplier through shell companies. Creating subtle quality issues. Financial pressure through carefully manipulated loan terms. Contract interference with Rodriguez Shipping.

Not revenge in the conventional sense. Not public humiliation or dramatic confrontation. But something far more devastating, the slow, inexorable erosion of everything they'd built.

"When do we begin?" |I asked, a strange calm settling over me.

"The TechVault announcement goes live at9 AM tomorrow. Your interview with Fortune runs thefollowing day. By week's end, the business world will be discussing Camille Kane, not Rose Lewis and Stefan Rodriguez's engagement."

Victoria poured two glasses of scotch, "And next week, we close on Bertolucci Textiles. The first domino falls."

On screen, Rose threw her bouquet, laughing as eager women reached for it. She aimed directly at the camera,her expression triumphant.

"Are you ready to begin?" Victoria asked quietly.

I turned from the screen, something dangerous awakening in my eyes. "Burn it all down."

Victoria touched her glass to mine. "Not burn," she corrected. "Burning is chaotic, emotional, easily traced.What we're about to do is surgical. Precise. Untraceable."
"Dismantle It all," 1 amended.

"Plece by piece,"she agreed."Until nothing remains but the fruth."

Later, 1 stood before my mirroT, studying the woman l'd become. The physical changes from Dr. Torres's work, sharper cheekbones, refined features. But the most profound changes were in my eyes, steady,focused, unafrald. The posture that no longer apologized for existing.

Rose wouldn't recognize me if we passed on the street. Stefan would see a stranger in an elevator. My own parents would look right through me.

Which made the justice to come perfect. I would move among them unrecognized. Would dismantle their world piece by piece without them suspecting the architect of their downfall.

On my desk lay a smail velvet box that hadn't been there earlier. Inside, platinum phoenix earrings with diamond eyes, matching Victoria's earlier gift.

The card read simply: "For tomorrow's rebirth. - V"

I touched the earrings gently, understanding the symbolism. Tomorrow marked not just a business success but my emergence from the ashes. My introduction to the world that had forgotten Camille Lewis, the world about to meet Camille Kane.

Let them celebrate tonight, I thought. Let them bask in their triumph, their perfect love story,their bright future together.

Tomorrow belonged to me. And all the tomorrows after that.

What awaited them was far worse than fire. It was the precise, methodical deconstruction of everything they belleved secure. The surgical removal of every support structure. The clean, untraceable dismantling of their perfect world.

Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not all at once in a satisfying explosion of vengeance.

But inevitably. Inexorably. Piece by carefully extracted piece.

Until nothing remained but truth.
###Chapter 30

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW

"Five minutes until your entrance, Ms. Kane."

I nodded to James, Victoria's head of security who now shadowed me at all public events. My heartbeat quickened, but my face revealed nothing. One year of training had perfected my mask, the serene,confident expression of a woman born to wealth and power rather than thrust into it by circumstance and revenge..

From my position in the private antechamber above the grand ballroom, I could observe without being seen.The Kane Industries Annual Charity Ball spread below me in a glittering panorama of wealth, influence, and carefully cultivated social connections. Three hundred of New York's elite in designer formal wear,diamonds catching light from crystal chandeliers, champagne flowing as freely as the gossip.

All of them waiting for their first real glimpse of Victoria Kane's mysterious adopted daughter. The woman who had appeared seemingly from nowhere, who had closed the TechVault acquisition that business publications called "the deal of the year,"who had been named heir to one of the largest private fortunes in the world.

The woman I had become.

"Are you ready?" Victoria appeared beside me, elegant in midnight blue, silver hair swept into a sophisticated updo. Nothing in her demeanor betrayed the significance of tonight, my official introduction to the social world that had once broken and discarded Camille Lewis.

"Born ready," I'replied, smoothing the skirt of my gown, a custom creation in deep emerald that hugged my transformed body before flowing to the floor in liquid silk. The color had been Victoria's suggestion. "Green for rebirth," she'd said. "For growth emerging from destruction."
Victoria studied me with critical eyes, looking for flaws in my presentation. Finding none, she nodded once."Remember, this isn't merelya social event. It's reconnaissance. Intelligence gathering.Every conversation has purpose."

"Identify allies, locate weaknesses, establish presence," I recited our agreed strategy. "I know my role."

"Good." Victoria checked her diamond watch. "Three minutes. The announcement will come after my welcome speech."

My finges brushed the phoenix pendant at my throat, my talisman, my reminder of transformation through fire. Matching earrings caught the light as I turned to check my reflection one final time in the antechamber's gilded mirror.

The woman looking back bore no resemblance to the one who had signed divorce papers on her anniversary a year ago. Dr. Torres's skilled alterations had given me sharper cheekbones, a more defined jawline, a slightly different nose. My once-long brown hair now fell in a sophisticated bob, darker and more dramatic. Designer clothes draped a body transformed by Jason's relentless combat training,leaner,stronger, carrying itself with unconscious authority.

But the most profound changes were in my eyes. No longer soft with seeking approval. No longer wounded by betrayal. Cool, assessing, confident in ways Camille Lewis had never been.

Rose wouldn't recognize me if we stood face to face. Stefan would see a stranger if we shared an elevator.My own parents would look right through me, not connecting this polished executive with their forgotten daughter.⑪

Perfect.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Victoria's voice carried through the sound system as she took the stage below."Welcome to the annual Kane Industries Charity Ball."

I moved to the top of the grand staircase, positioning myself just out of sight of the crowd below. From here,I could see everything, the raised stage where Victoria addressed the assembled guests, the dance floor surrounding it, the tables laden with gourmet delicacies, the bar areas where the real business of the evening would occur in quiet conversations lubricated by expensive alcohol.
"As you know," Victoria continued, "tonight's event benefits the Kane Foundation for Educational Excellence,which has provided over two billion dollars in scholarships and program funding since its inception."

Polite applause rippled through the crowd. These people hadn't come for charity, they'd come for connections, for status, for the exclusive privilege of attending the most sought-after social event of the season. The millions raised were merely a convenient byproduct of their networking.

"Before we continue with the evening's program,like to make an introduction many of you have been anticipating." Victoria's voice changed subtly, warming with what sounded to the uninitiated like maternal pride. Only I knew the calculation behind this performance.some of you may know, I've recently welcomed a daughter into my life."②

A murmur ran through the crowd, speculation finally about to be confirmed.

"Though we've kept her identity private until now to allow her time to acclimate to her new role, many of you have already read about her business achievements." Victoria turned toward the staircase where I waited.|gives me great pleasure to introduce my daughter and heir, Camille Kane."

My cue. I stepped forward, emerging into view at the top of the staircase. Three hundred faces turned upward, scrutinizing every detail of my appearance, hungry for first impressions they could dissect later in private conversations.

I paused for precisely three seconds, long enough to be noticed, not long enough to seem hesitant,before descending the stairs with practiced grace. The emerald gown whispered against marble steps, the slit revealing glimpses of leg with each movement, the bodice catching light in subtle patterns designed to draw the eye without seeming ostentatious.①

Every eye tracked my progress. Every conversation halted. Even the serving staff paused in their duties,caught in the gravitational pull of a moment they sensed was significant.

Victoria extended her hand as I reached the bottom step, a gesture both welcoming and possessive. I took it, allowing her to draw me forward into the spotlight.

"Thank you, Mother,"|said, the word still strange on my tongue despite months of practice. "I'm honored to join you tonight."
Simple words, delivered with quiet confidence. Not overeager. Not nervous. The perfect blend of gratitude and self-assurance expected from someone worthy of the Kane name.

Applause broke out, polite at first, then warmer as Victoria smiled her approval. Not of me, but of their response to me. The room read her body language, her facial cues, and adjusted their own reactions accordingly.If Victoria Kane valued this young woman, they would as well, at least to her face.

"Please, enjoy the evening," Victoria concluded, dismissing the crowd with a regal nod. "Remember,every dollar spent tonight benefits children who deserve educational opportunities regardless of economic background."

The orchestra resumed playing as Victoria guided me through the initial gauntlet, board members and their spouses, major shareholders, key political figures whose support Kane Industries cultivated with careful attention. Names and faces I'd memorized from dossiers, now animated before me, each requiring specific handling.

"Senator Williams, how lovely to see you again," Victoria said to a silver-haired man with an ambitious wife half his age. "Have you met my daughter?"

"Only by reputation," he replied, eyes assessing me with interest that wasn't entirely professional."Your TechVault acquisition was impressively executed. Especially for someone so new to the field."

The slight condescension in his tone might have once made me shrink, apologize, explain. Now I simply smiled, meeting his gaze directly.

"New perspectives often see opportunities others miss," I replied, the practiced line delivered as if it had just occurred to me. "Though I certainly benefited from excellent guidance."

The senator's wife, Melanie? Melissa?touched my arm with false familiarity."That gown is divine. Is it Valentino?"

"Custom Zac Posen," I corrected gently, noting how her fingers lingered on the fabric, assessing its cost, its exclusivity. "Your Dior is stunning as well. Spring collection?"

Her surprise at my accurate identification flickered briefly before she recovered. "Yes! You have a good eye."
"Camille has many talents," Victoria interjected smoothly, before guiding me away. "We must continue our rounds, but please enjoy the evening."

As we moved through the crowd, she murmured, "Williams is facing an ethics investigation. His wife spends beyond their means to maintain appearances.Potentially useful information."

I nodded, filing this away with all the other details Victoria shared about our guests. Every introduction came with subtext, every conversation containing layers beneath its surface pleasantries.

For the next hour, I performed exactly as trained, charming but not effusive, intelligent but not intimidating,attentive but not overeager. The perfect heir to Victoria's empire, raised in European privacy, now emerging to take her rightful place.

By the time Victoria released me to circulate independently, I had identifiedthree potential business allies,recognized two social climbers to avoid, and cataloged countless relationships and rivalries that might prove useful in future negotiations.

"Don't stay with any one group too long," Victoria advised before departing to speak with the mayor."Circulate. Observe. Remember why we're here."

As if I could forget. Every moment of this evening served our larger purpose, establishing Camille Kane as a force in her own right, gathering intelligence on the social world Rose aspired to dominate, laying groundwork for the next phase of our plan.

I accepted a glass of champagne from a passing waiter, sipping it slowly as I moved through the crowd.Women studied my gown, my jewelry, my hair, assessng my status in their private hierarchies. Men tracked my movements with varying degrees of subtlety, some professionally curious, others with more personal interest.

None of them saw me. Not really. They saw wwhat I wanted them to see, Victoria Kane's polished heir,mysterious and intriguing, worth cultivating as a connection. None recognized the woman who had once moved among them as Stefan Rodriguez's unremarkable wife, as Rose Lewis's overshadowed sister.

The irony almost made me smile.
###Chapter 31

Camille's pooint of view

"Ms. Kane." A deep voice interrupted my thoughts. "Andrew Hargrove, Meridian Investments. I've been hoping to speak with you about your approach to the TechVault integration."

I turned to find a middle-aged executive with expensive dental work and even more expensive cufflinks. One of many who had dismissed me during my first attempt at the MicroLink negotiation, now eager to discuss strategy with Victoria Kane's heir.

"Mr. Hargrove," I replied, extending my hand. "I believe we met briefly at the Barrett negotiations last year."

His expression flickered wih confusion, then embarrassment as he failed to recall our previous encounter."Did we? I apologize for not remembering."

"No apology necessary," I assured him, satisfaction warming my chest. "I was observing rather than participating at that point in my training."

Training. As if I'd been Victoria's protégée all along, not a broken woman she'd rescued and transformed for mutual benefit.

"Of course." Hargrove recovered quickly, ego soothed by my gracious handling of his lapse. "I'd love to hear your thoughts on technology acquisition strategy when you have a moment. My firm is considering several targets in the same sector."

"I'd be happy to share some general perspectives," I replied, maintaining the careful balance between professional courtesy and strategic advantage. "Perhaps at the Kane Industries conference next month?I believe Meridian will be represented."

The conversation continued in this vein, him fishing for insights, me providing just enough to seem helpful while revealing nothing of value. A dance I'd rehearsed countless times with Victoria, now executed flawlessly in the field.

When Hargrove eventually excused himself, I resumed my circuit of the room, pausing occasionally to exchange pleasantries with guests Victoria had identified as potentiallyvaluable connections. Always moving,always observing, absorbing the dynamics of a social world Camille Lewis had only glimpsed from its periphery.

"Your mother has trained you well," observed an elderly woman draped in heirloom jewels as I joined her briefly at a high-top table. "You have her watchfulness."

I recognized her from my preparation materials, Margaret Whitmore, society doyenne and longtime acquaintance of Victoria's. Not quite a friend,Victoria didn't have friends, but a respected equal in New York's social hierarchy.

"High praise, Mrs. Whitmore," I replied. "Though I've much to learn still."

"Hmm." She studied me over her martini glass. "You move differently than most new money. More...contained. Like someone used to taking up less space who's now allowing herself room to expand."

The observation was uncomfortably perceptive. I maintained my pleasant expression, neither confirming nor denying her assessment.

"Victoria never does anything without multiple reasons," she continued. "I've known her thirty five years,since before she was Victoria Kane. Back when she was just Victoria Reynolds from nowhere Pennsylvania,determined to conquer New York through sheer force of will."

This was new information. Victoria rarely discussed her background before her marriage to William Kane.

"She identified you for a purpose," Mrs. Whitmore said, eyes sharp despite her age. "I wonder what it might be."

Before I could formulate a response that would neither reveal nor deny too much, a commotion near the entrance drew attention. Even the orchestra seemed to falter momentarily as a new arrival created a subtle ripple through the crowd.

"Ah,"Mrs.Whitmore smiled slightly. "Alexander has decided to grace us with his presence after all."
I followed her gaze to the man now being greeted with particular deference by the event staff. Tall, dark-haired, impeccably dressed in a tuxedo that somehow looked more deliberate than those around him. His face wasn't conventionally handsome, too intense, features too strong, but compelling in its intelligence and focus. Despite his youth, he couldn't be more than twenty-eight or twenty-nine, he carried himself with the unmistakable authority of enormous power.

"Alexander Pierce," Mrs. Whitmore explained, noting my attention. "Surely Victoria has mentioned him."

The name sent a jolt through me.Alexander Pierce, the young trillionaire whose technological innovations had revolutionized multiple industries. Victoria's most formidable business rival, despite the significant age gap between them. His rapid rise to wealth and influence had been unprecedented, his companies consistently outmaneuvering established players in every sector they entered.

"She's mentioned him," I said carefully, watching as he moved through the crowd with a peculiar economy of motion. Unlike the other guests who performed for each other, laughing too loudly, gesturing too broadly,constantly seeking attention, Pierce moved as if unconcerned with being observed.

"They avoid each other generally," Mrs. Whitmore continued, clearly enjoying being the source of information I hadn't anticipated. "Fierce competitors, those two. Though I always wondered if there wasn't more to their mutual hostility than just business."

I kept my expression neutral despite my racing thoughts. Victoria had never suggested Pierce might attend tonight. Had never included him in our preparation discussions. An oversight unlike her usual thoroughness.

"If you'Il excuse me," Isaid to Mrs. Whitmore, "I should continue my rounds."

"Of course, dear. Do come find me again later. I have the most interesting gossip about that fashion designer everyone's talking about, Rose something-or-other. Just became engaged her dead sister's husband Stefan the Rodriguez shipping heir."

My pulse jumped at the mention of Rose and Stefan, but I merely smiled politely before moving away. Now wasn't the time to pursue that particular thread, not with Alexander Pierce's unexpected presence demanding assessment.

I circulated carefully through the ballroom, maintaining distance from Pierce while keeping him in my peripheral vision. He spoke little,listened intently, moved with purpose rather than social obligation. Several times I felt his gaze on me, though whenever I glanced in his direction, he appeared engaged elsewhere.

Victoria had also noticed his arrival. I caught her watching him with an expression I couldn't quite interpret,not quite hostility, not quite concern. Something more complex. When our eyes met across the room,she gave an almost imperceptible nod. Acknowledgment of a complication, perhaps. Or instruction to proceed as planned despite it.

An hour later, as I conversed with the CFO of a major technology corporation about blockchain applications,Victoria appeared at my side.

"Thomas, I need to borrow my daughter," she said smoothly. "Board matter requiring immediate attention."

The CFO retreated with appropriate deference, and Victoria guided me toward a quieter corner of the ballroom.

"Pierce," she said without preamble. "I didn't anticipate his attendance. He rarely comes to sociaI events,especially ones hosted by competitors."

"Should I be concerned?" | asked, keeping my voice low.

Victoria's eyes tracked Pierce across the room. "Uncertain. He's brilliant but unporedictable. His companies have been aggressively moving into spaces adjacent to Kane Industries for the past three years."

"You never told me much about him,"|observed.

"There's not much to tell beyond what appears in business publications," Victoria replied. "He emerged from nowhere seven years ago with a revolutionary Al algorithm, built an empire with remarkable speed, and has been a thorn in my side ever since. Barely thirty and already worth more than my net worth."

I processed this information quickly. "How much does he know about me? About my background?"

"Nothing," Victoria said firmly. "He's been primarily in Asia for the past year, expanding his tech empire there.Has had minimal contact with my circles."

Yet something in her tone suggested she wasn't entirely confident of this assessment.
"Should I avoid him?"|asked.

Victoria considered for a moment, then shook her head. "No. That would appear unusual, given your position. If he approaches, be cordial but brief. You've been well-trained for unexpected situations."

With that advice, she departed to manage a minor crisis involving a drunk board member and an overly inquisitive journalist.

I resumed my social circuit, hyperaware now of Pierce's location in the room. For another hour,we conducted a strange dance of proximity without interaction, occupying the same general spaces but never quite converging, like planets in separate but overlapping orbits.

Until suddenly, inevitably, the orbits aligned.

"Ms. Kane," a smooth voice said behind me as I refreshed my champagne at the bar. "I believe we're the only two people in this room who haven't been formally introduced."

I turned to find Alexander Pierce standing closer than I'd expected, his height requiring me to tilt my head slightly to meet his gaze. This close, I could see his eyes were an unusual gray, not the flat color of storm clouds but something more complex, with hints of blue or green depending on the light.

Eyes that studied me with unsettling intensity.

"Mr. Pierce." |extended my hand, the gesture both defensive and welcoming. "I was beginning to think you were avoiding me."

A small smile touched his mouth, not quite reaching those watchful eyes. "I was observing. A habit Victoria likely taught you as well."

He took my offered hand, but instead of shaking it as expected, he brought it to his lips in an old-fashioned gesture that somehow didn't seem affected coming from him.

As his mouth brushed my knuckles, he locked eyes with mine and murmured words that turned my blood to ice: "Welcome back to the land of the living, Ms. Kane. Or should I use your previous name?"
###Chapter 32



CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW



His words hung in the air between us, dangerous and sharp. "Welcome back to the land of the living, Ms.Kane.Or should I use your previous name?"


I kept my face still, fighting the storm that raged inside my chest. Years of practice hiding emotions from Rose. Months of Victoria's merciless training Everything in me focused on not revealing the bolt of fear that shot through my body.



"I'm afraid you've mistaken me for someone else," I said, withdrawing my hand from his grasp. My voice stayed perfectly steady, cool and distant. "I don't have a previous name."



Alexander Pierce studied me with those unnerving gray eyes, a slight smile playing at the corners of his mouth.Too knowing. Too certain.



"Is that so?" He tilted his head slightly, examining me as one might examine an interesting puzzle. "My mistake,then."
But his tone made it clear he believed no such thing He wasn't backing down, merely shifting tactics.



"First public appearance?" he asked, smoothly changing subjects while maintaining uncomfortable eye contact. "Victoria has kept you well hidden until now."



"Mother believed I needed time to adjust before facing the social spotlight," I replied, using the bland explanation we'd crafted for curious questions."European privacy has its advantages."



"European privacy," he repeated, the phrase clearly amusing him."How...convenient."



The way he stressed that word, *convenient* made my stomach tighten. This man knew something. Or thought he did. Either way, he presented a danger l hadn't prepared for.



"'If you'll excuse me," I began, seeking escape from this increasingly dangerous conversation. "I should..."



"Should continue making the rounds?" he finished for me. "Of course. Victoria's careful choreography must be followed." He glanced across the room to where Victoria stood conversing with the mayor, though her attention clearly remained partly on us. "But I suspect we'll be seeing more of each other, Ms. Kane."
The way he emphasized my last name carried volumes of unspoken meaning.



"I look forward to it," I lied smoothly.



He smiled then, a genuine expression that transformed his severe features, making him appear younger,almost boyish despite his imposing presence.



"No,you don't," he said quietly. "But you will."



With that cryptic statement, he stepped back, offering a small bow that somehow managed to be both respectful and mocking simultaneously. "Until next time."



I watched him move away through the crowd, people unconsciously shifting to make space for him. Despite his youth compared to most titans of industry in the room, Alexander Pierce carried an authority that commanded deference without demanding it.



My heart raced beneath my carefully composed exterior. One year of transformation. One year of becoming someone new. One year of building Camille Kane from the ruins of Camille Lewis.



And it had taken him exactly one minute to threaten everything.


"I see you met Alexander."
Victoria appeared beside me, materializing from the crowd with her usual perfect timing. Her expression revealed nothing, but I knew her well enough now to recognize the tension in her shoulders, the slightly too -controlled quality of her movements.


"He's... not what l expected," I said carefully, aware of listening ears around us.



"He rarely is." Victoria guided me toward the silent auction displays, creating a bubble of privacy amid the busy ballroom. "What did he say to you?"



I hesitated, unsure how much to reveal in this public setting. "He implied he knew me. From before."



Victoria's face remained impassive, but I caught the brief tightening of her fingers on her champagne glass, the only sign of her surprise and concern.



"Impossible," she said after a measured pause. "The surgical alterations are too good. Your public presence as Camille Lewis was minimal. And Pierce has been in Asia for most of the past year."



"Nevertheless," I replied quietly, "he said something about welcoming me back to the land of the living and asked if he should use my previous name."



Victoria's eyes narrowed slightly, the only indication of the calculations happening behind her carefully maintained social mask.



"It's a fishing expedition," she decided. "A guess based on limited information. Pierce has always enjoyed psychological games, especially with those in my circle."



Her explanation made logical sense, yet didn't fully calm the unease growing inside me. Something in Pierce's certainty had felt too genuine, too knowing



"Continue as planned," Victoria instructed. "The governor is waiting to meet you. Then the museum director, the foundation board members, and the Japanese investors at table twelve."



Just like that, we moved on. Back to the carefully orchestrated evening, back to my debut as Victoria Kane's heir, back to pretending Alexander Pierce hadn't just threatened to unravel everything with a few well-chosen words.



For the next two hours, I performed flawlessly.Charmed the governor. Discussed art acquisitions with the museum director. Impressed the foundation board with my knowledge of their programs. Spoke passable Japanese to the investors.



All while hyperaware of Pierce's presence in the room,feeling his gaze on me at unexpected moments,catching glimpses of that knowing smile whenever our eyes accidentally mnet across the crowded ballroom.


By the time the event concluded and we were in Victoria's private car heading home, exhaustion pressed down on me like a physical weight. Not the tiredness of working muscles, which Jason's training had long accustomed me to, but the bone-deep weariness that comes from maintaining perfect control under threat.



"We need to address the Pierce situation," Victoria said once the privacy screen was securely in place between us and the driver. "He's more dangerous than I anticipated."


"How could he possibly know?" I asked, finally giving voice to the question that had haunted me all evening."The changes to my appearance are significant.Even Rose wouldn't recognize me if we passed on the street."



Victoria gazed out the window at the city lights, her profile sharp against the darkness. "Pierce has resources I can't always track. Intelligence networks beyond the usual corporate espionage. And an almost supernatural intuition for patterns others miss."



"That's not an answer," I pressed, needing something more concrete than vague descriptions of Pierce's capabilities.
"No," she agreed, turning back to me. "It's not. The truth is, I don't know how he identified you. But I intend to find out."



The car moved through the late-night traffic, the silence between us growing heavier with unspoken concerns. Finally, as we approached the gate to Victoria's estate, she spoke again.



"Whatever Pierce thinks he knows, he can't prove anything. Your transformation is legally airtight.Camille Lewis is officially dead. Camille Kane has documentation going back decades."



Her words should have reassured me, but something in her tone suggested she was trying to convince herself as much as me.



Inside the mansion, Victoria retreated to her study with instructions not to be disturbed. I made my way to my suite, dismissing the staff who waited to assist with my evening routine. I needed solitude. Needed space to process what had happened.



In my dressing room, I stared at my reflection in the full-length mirror. The woman who looked back at me was undeniably elegant, poised, beautiful in a striking rather than conventional way. My emerald gown caught the light as I turned, the custom fabric moving like water against my skin. The phoenix pendant at my throat gleamed gold against pale skin.
Not a trace remained of Camnille Lewis. Not the softer face, not the hesitant posture, not the apologetic smile. Dr. Torres had seen to the physical transformation, Jason to the changes in how I carried myself,Victoria to the rest.


Yet Alexander Pierce had looked at me and somehow seen through it all.


*"Welcome back to the land of the living, Ms. Kane.Or should I use your previous name?"*


I removed my jewelry, carefully placing each piece in its designated spot in my safe. The routine task did nothing to quiet my racing thoughts.



Who was Alexander Pierce, really? The business publications described him as a wunderkind, a technological genius who had built a trillion-dollar empire before hs thirtieth birthday. His companies spanned artificial intelligence, biotechnology,space exploration, and media. His personal life remained largely private, with occasional appearances at high-profile events but few personal details shared with the press.



A rival to Victoria in business, certainly. But something in their interaction tonight had suggested a history beyond mere corporate competition.


As I removed my makeup, another layer of Camille Kane washing away with each gentle stroke of the cleansing cloth, I found myself returning to the moment of our introduction. The intensity in his gray eyes. The certainty in his voice. The briefest touch of his lips against my knuckles.



My hand tingled at the memory, an unexpected physical reaction that annoyed me with its adolescent quality. Attraction had no place in the life I'd built with Victoria. Emotional entanglements of any kind were distractions from our purpose, justice for what Rose and Stefan had done to me.



Yet I couldn't dismiss Alexander Pierce so easily.Couldn't file him away as merely another obstacle to overcome or strategic variable to account for.Something about him had gotten under my skin in a way nothing had since my transformation began.



Perhaps it was the threat he represented. Perhaps it was the mystery of how he'd identified me. Or perhaps it was something more primal, the shock of being truly seen for the first time in a year.
###Chapter 33



Camille's point of view



Everyone else saw what I wanted them to see. What Victoria had crafted me to show. Alexander Pierce had somehow looked past all of that to the woman beneath, the woman I thought was safely buried.



I showered, letting hot water wash away the last traces of tonight's performance, then changed into silk pajamas and moved to the sitting area of my suite.Sleep would be impossible with my mind in such turmoil. Instead, I poured a small glass of bourbon from the decanter on my side table, a habit adopted from Victoria, and curled into the window seat overlooking the grounds.



The estate spread below me, perfectly manicured gardens now shadowed in moonlight, security lights marking the perimeter in the distance. Beyond the gates, the city glowed against the night sky, millions of lives unfolding in patterns I would never know.


*"| suspect we'll be seeing more of each other, Ms.Kane."*
His words played in my mind, the confidence in them suggesting he'd already decided our paths would cross again. Not a hope or a plan, but a certainty. As if he knew something about the future that I didn't.



The bourbon warmed my throat as I sipped it, the expensive liquor tasting of oak and vanilla and something deeper,something that reminded me of how Pierce had smelled standing close to me,expensive cologne with notes of cedar and leather underlying it.



I frowned, annoyed at myself for noticing such details,for remembering them, for finding them pleasant rather than irrelevant. Victoria had trained me better than this. Physical reactions were to be noted,cataloged, and dismissed if they served no strategic purpose.



And yet.



And yet, something about Alexander Pierce had awakened feelings I thought dead along with Camille Lewis. Not romantic interest, nothing so simple or benign. More a deep-seated curiosity, a pull toward something or someone who presented a genuine mystery in a world I'd come to understand as ruled by patterns and calculations.



My phone buzzed softly on the table beside me.A message from Victoria: *Security briefing, 7 AM.
Research team gathering information on Pierce. Sleep if you can.*


The clinical tone was typical of her, emotions relegated to background noise against the forward march of strategic planning. I sent back a simple acknowledgment, then set the phone aside, returning my attention to the moonlit gardens and the thoughts I couldn't quite organize.


What would Alexander Pierce do next? The question demanded consideration. If he truly believed I was Camille Lewis, resurrected and transformed, what purpose would that knowledge serve for him?Leverage against Victoria, perhaps? A business advantage of some kind?


Or was his interest more personal? I'd caught something in his expression beyond mere strategic calculation. A curiosity that mirrored my own, perhaps.An interest that transcended whatever game he might be playing with Victoria.


His words was it a promise, or was it a threat? lingered in my mind as I finished my bourbon and prepared for bed. Sleep would be difficult to find tonight, but tomorrow would demand full focus. Victoria would have a plan, a counter-strategy against whatever threat Pierce presented. She always did.


As I slid between silk sheets, my mind refused to quiet,
images from the evening playing behind closed eyelids. The glittering ballroom. The assessing eyes of the social elite. Victoria's carefully orchestrated introductions.



And Alexander Pierce, looking at me with those penetrating gray,eyes, seeing what no one else had managed to see beneath the careful construction of Camille Kane.



Was it fear I felt at that prospect, or something dangerously close to relief?



The question followed me into uneasy dreams where I ran through endless corridors, pursued by shadows with piercing gray eyes. Dreams where I stood before mirrors that reflected not my current face but the one I'd left behind. Dreams where Alexander Pierce whispered my old name, over and over, until I turned to face him, only to find myself waking with a start,heart pounding in the darkness of my room.



Dawn found me at my window again, watching the first light touch the gardens below. I'd managed perhaps three hours of broken sleep, not nearly enough for the day ahead, but more than I'd expected given the turmoil in my mind.



I showered again, dressed in the power suit laid out by my stylist, applied makeup with practiced precision.Each action a step in the daily transformation from private self to public persona. By the time I checked my reflection before heading to breakfast, Camille Kane stared back at me, confident, controlled,composed.



No trace remained of the confusion and uncertainty that had plagued,me through the night. No hint of the dreams that had disturbed my sleep. Just the woman Victoria had created, the heir to her empire, the instrument of justice against those who had wronged me.



Yet as I moved through the morning routine,breakfast with Victoria, security briefing wit James,review of press coverage from the previous night's event, I found my thoughts repeatedly returning to Alexander Pierce. To the certainty in his voice when he'd all but named me as Camille Lewis. To the strange connection I'd felt despite the threat he represented.



"The press coverage is universally positive," Victoria noted over coffee, scanning reports on her tablet."Your debut is being hailed as the social event of the season. Several publications are already speculating about the impact you'll have on Kane Industries moving forward."



"And Pierce?" I asked, unable to keep the question contained any longer."Any mention of ourinteraction?"
Victoria's eyes flicked up to mine, assessing. "Nothing specific. Though the business press notes his unexpected appearance at an event hosted by his chief competitor."


She set down her tablet, giving me her full attention,arareoccurrence during morning briefings."You seem...preoccupied with Alexander Pierce."



Not a question. An observation that demanded explanation.



"He threatened everything we've built," I pointed out,keeping my voice neutral. "Identified me despite all our precautions. That seems worthy of preoccupation."


"Yes," Victoria agreed, studying me with the penetrating gaze that always made me feel transparent. "But there's something more. Something you're not sharing."



I hesitated, unsure how to articulate the strange pull I'd felt toward Pierce without sounding foolish.Without sounding like the old Camille, easily swayed by attention from confident men.


"There was something... familiar about him," I said finally. "Not that I've met him before. But a sense that he understood something about me that others don't.Can't."
Victoria's expression remained unreadable, but I sensed a shift in her attention, a sharpening of focus "Elaborate."



"He looked at me and saw through the surface," I tried to explain. "Not just suspecting I might be Camille Lewis, but... seeing me. The person beneath the transformation."



My words sounded ridiculous to my own ears, my/stical rather than strategic,emotional rather than calculated.Everything Victoria had trained me to avoid.



Yet she didn't dismiss my observation. Instead, she seemed to consider it carefully, fingers tapping a slow rhythm on the polished table.



"Alexander Pierce has always possessed unusual insight into people," she said after a moment. "It's part of what makes him dangerous. He sees patterns others miss, connections others overlook."


She rose,moving to the window that overlooked the front drive where her car waited. "Whatever connection you feel,whatever recognition you sensed,remember that it serves his purposes, not yours. Not ours."



"Of course," I agreed quickly, embarrassed to have revealed even that much vulnerability. "I'm not suggesting otherwise."
Victoria turned back to me, her expression softening fractionally. "Pierce is brilliant, charismatic,and utterly ruthless in pursuit of his goals. Much like me, in that regard." A small, tight smile. "Perhaps that's why we've been such effective rivals."



She gathered her things, preparing to depart for the office. "The security team will have a complete dossier on his recent activities by this afternoon. Until then, proceed with today's schedule as planned. The TechVault integration meetings require your full attention."



With that, she was gone, leaving me with a strange sense of having revealed too much and learned too little all at once.



The morning passed in a blur of meetings and conference calls, the business of Kane Industries demanding complete focus. Yet beneath the professional exterior | maintained, thoughts of Alexander Pierce continued to surface at unexpected moments.



The way he'd looked at me. The certainty in his voice.The promise of seeing each other again.


I found myself wondering what he was doing now.Whether he was thinking about our encounter as well.Whether he was already planning our next meeting,or if his attention had moved on to other matters, other adversaries.



The latter possibility bothered me more than it should have.



By late afternoon, fatigue from the previous night's broken sleep finally caught up with me. I retreated to my office, instructing my assistant to hold calls for thirty minutes while I reviewed documents that required privacy. Once alone, I moved to the window seat, allowing myself a rare moment of unguarded thought.



Alexander Pierce had recognized me. Had seen through layers of surgical alteration, physical transformation, and behavioral retraining to the woman I'd been before. The question that haunted me wasn't how he'd done it, but why it mattered so much to me that he had.



Was it simple fear of exposure? Of having everything Victoria and I had built together threatened by one man's dangerous knowledge?



Or was it the vertigo-inducing sensation of being truly seen after a year of perfect disguise? The strange relief mixed with terror when someone looked past Camille Kane to the woman beneath, the woman l sometimes feared I'd lost completely in the transformation.


I closed my eyes, the afternoon sun warm on my face through the window glass. Whatever the reason,Alexander Pierce had disturbed something in me that had been carefully buried, carefully controlled Something that would need to be addressed if I was to maintain the clarity of purpose Victoria had instilled in me



When we meet again, I would be ready. Would have answers to the questions he raised, both spoken and unspoken. Would understand the threat he presented and how to neutralize it.



Would understand why, despite everything, I found myself almost looking forward to our next encounter.



Almost.
###Chapter 34



"You'll attend the Bellamy Gallery auction in my place tonight," Victoria said, not looking up from the documents spread across her desk. The statement carried the weight of command rather than request.


Camille paused by the doorway of Victoria's home office."The Bellamy auction? Isn't that where..."



"Yes," Victoria confirmed, finally glancing up with calculating eyes. "According to my sources, both Rose and Stefan will be in attendance. Rose has been desperately trying to secure a meeting with Kane Industries' investment team for weeks. This presents an... opportunity." 1



Camille's heart quickened. "To see them?"



"To observe their dynamics in a neutral setting. To understand exactly what you're up against." Victoria rose from her chair, moving to stand before Camille with critical assessmnent. "The question is whether you're ready."



"I've spent months preparing," Camille replied,steadying her voice. "I've changed everything about myself. They won't recognize me."


Victoria's expression remained unconvinced. "Physical transformation is only part of it. Can you maintain your composure when you see the man who abandoned you with the sister who betrayed you?"



The question struck like a physical blow, but Camille didn't flinch."Yes."



"Even when anger threatens to overwhelm you? When every instinct screams to reveal yourself?"



"Yes," Camille repeated,more firmly this time.



Victoria studied her for a long moment before nodding once. "The Dior in midnight blue. Simple diamond studs. Your hair swept back. You are Camille Kane tonight,confident,untouchable.Remember,you aren't attending to confront them. You're there to remind yourself why all of this is necessary.Remember who you are now. Camille Kane. My daughter. My heir." With those words lingering in her mind, Camille prepared for the evening ahead.







The evening at the gallery had drawn Manhattan's elite like moths to flame, their jewelry catching light beneath crystal chandeliers. Through the glittering crowd, Camille saw them first, Rose and Stefan entering arm in arm, her sister's red dress a slash of  color against Stefan's dark suit. The sight sent ice through her veins, though nothing showed on her carefully composed face.



She kept her champagne glass steady, maintained her pleasant expression as she discussed upcoming exhibitions with the museum curator. But beneath that polished exterior, her pulse quickened with a mix of rage and anticipation. They moved through the room like they owned it, Rose's practiced laugh carrying over the general chatter, Stefan's hand resting possessively at her waist.



When the curator excused himself, Camille knew what was coming. She watched Rose's predatory gaze scan the room, noting faces, calculating connections. The moment her sister spotted her, those familiar eyes lit with interest, registering the designer dress,the subtle jewelry, the way other guests deferred to her presence.



"I don't believe we've been properly introduced," Rose purred, extending her hand with practiced grace."Rose Lewis. And this is my fiancé, Stefan Rodriguez."



Camille accepted the hand that had once straightened her wedding veil, fought back the urge to either crush it or recoil. "Camille Kane. A pleasure."


She watched confusion flicker across Stefan's face at her name, quickly masked but present. Rose's smile remained fixed, though calculation sparked behind her eyes as she processed the surname.


"Kane... any relation to Victoria Kane?" The casual tone couldn't hide her sudden intensity.


"My mother," Camille replied simply, watching that information land. Rose's smile widened fractionally,here was the connection she'd been hoping to make since her failed meeting with Kane Industries.



"How fascinating!" Rose leaned in slightly, like sharing a confidence. "I've long admired your mother's business acumen. In fact, I recently had the pleasure of meeting with one of her representatives about potential investment in my fashion line."


Camille let her lips curve in the slight smile Victoria had taught her, one that offered nothing while suggesting everything. "Yes, I believe I saw the proposal cross my desk."


Stefan shifted his weight, something about her clearly needling at his subconscious. "I'm sorry, but have we met before? Something seems familiar..."



"I don't believe so," Camille replied coolly,even as her heart thundered in her chest. "I've spent most of my life in Europe. Only recently returned to New York."



"Of course," he said quickly, though doubt lingered in his expression. "My mistake. You just reminded me of someone for a moment."



Rose shot him a quick, sharp look before turning back to Camille with renewed warmth. "We simply must have lunch soon. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the current fashion landscape. Perhaps next week?"



"I'm afraid my schedule is quite full," Camille demurred, using the subtle dismissal Victoria had drilled into her. "But do keep in touch with our investment team. I'm sure they'll be in contact once decisions are made."



She watched Rose's smile tighten almost imperceptibly. Her sister wasn't used tobeing the one seeking favor rather than granting it. The role reversal clearly unsettled her, though she recovered quickly.


"Of course," Rose said smoothly. "We won't keep you from your other guests. Stefan?”


As they moved away, Camille maintained her composed expression while victory sang through her veins. They hadn't recognized her. The woman they had methodically destroyed stood right before them,and they hadn't known her.



She excused herself to the powder room, needing a moment to steady her racing heart. The private space offered brief sanctuary, allowing her to study her reflection, the sharp cheekbones that had replaced softer features, the elegantly styled hair so different from her former length, the confidence in her posture that Dr. Torres's work and Victoria's training had carefully crafted. No trace remained of the woman they had known.



But that woman's emotions still raged beneath the surface,memories of betrayal sharp as knives. Seeing them together, so casually content, so unburdened by their cruelty... it took every ounce of control not to reveal herself, not to show them exactly who stood before them.



The door opened and Camille instantly checked her expression. Rose entered, pausing briefly when she saw who occupied the mirror.


"Ms. Kane," she said warmly. "I hope you'll forgive my persistence, but I simply had to try one more time.My line really is doing exceptional things with sustainable luxury fashion. Perhaps I could have my assistant send over our latest projections?"



Camille met her sister's eyes in the mirror, the same eyes that had watched Stefan sign divorce papers on her anniversary, that had feigned sympathy while stealing her husband, that had likely celebrated news of her "death."



"Ms. Lewis," Camille said quietly, savoring the small flinch Rose couldn't quite hide. "In business, timing is everything. And I'm afraid your timing is... unfortunate."


Rose's smile faltered slightly. "I don't understand."



"The market is shifting. Luxury fashion is a crowded space." Camille turned to face her directly, allowing just a hint of the truth to color her words. "Sometimes no matter how hard we try, no matter how perfect our presentation, things simply don't work out the way we hoped."



Something dark flickered in Rose's eyes, a glimpse of the calculating predator beneath her polished smile."Everything works out exactly as it should," she said,her tone carrying an edge. "Eventually."



"Perhaps," Camille agreed smoothly. "But not always in the way we expect."



She moved toward the door, pausing with her hand on the handle. "Congratulations on your engagement,by the way.Second chances are so rare, aren't they?"



The confused unease on Rose's face was almost worth the years of pain that had led to this moment.Camille slipped out of the powder room, her composed exit masking the trembling in her hands.


Her controlled departure ended abruptly as she collided with someone just outside the door. Strong hands steadied her before she could stumble, the touch sending an unwelcome shiver down her spine.

"We meet again, Ms. Kane," Alexander Pierce's voice held that same knowing tone that had haunted her since the charity ball. "Though perhaps we should stop running into each other quite so literally."


His gray eyes studied her face with unsettling intensity,his hands lingering on her arms a moment longer than necessary.When he finally released her, that infamous smirk played at his lips.



"Mr. Pierce," she managed, fighting to keep her voice steady. "I wasn't aware you frequented art galleries."



"I go where my interests lead me," he replied, his gaze never leaving her face. The unspoken meaning behind his words hung heavy in the air between them.



Across the room, Rose had emerged from the powder room just in time to witness their interaction. She drifted toward an elderly woman known for her encyclopedic knowledge of New York society,carefully positioning herself within earshot.



"That's Victoria Kane's daughter with Alexander Pierce,"the woman was telling another guest, her voice carrying just enough to reach Rose's ears. "The heiress to Kane Industries. Quite the story, adopted years ago but kept out of the public eye until recently. Now she's set to inherit one of the largest fortunes in the world."
Rose's perfectly manicured nails dug into her palm as the information sank in. The woman she'd just practically begged for investment wasn't merely Victoria's daughter or a Kane Industries executive, she was Victoria Kane's chosen heir. The realization of how badly she'd mishandled their interaction made her stomach churn.



Stefan appeared at her side, noticing her sudden tension. "What's wrong?"



"Do you realize who that is?" Rose hissed under her breath, watching as Pierce and Camille continued their intense conversation. "Victoria Kane's daughter.Not just some company representative, the actual heir to Kane Industries."



Meanwhile, Camille felt caught between two fires,Pierce's dangerous knowledge of her true identity, and Rose's newly informed observation of their interaction.She could practically see the calculations happening behind her sister's eyes, likely already planning how to salvage the situation and gain access to the Kane fortune.



"Having an interesting evening?" Pierce asked softly,clearly enjoying her discomfort. "Family reunions can be so... complicated."


"| don't know what you think you know," Camille replied quietly, "but you're playing a dangerous game."
His smile widened fractionally. "On the contrary, Ms.Kane, or should I say Ms. Lewis? I think I'm the only one here who truly understands the game being played." 2



Before she could respond, he stepped closer,his voice dropping to barely a whisper. "The question is, do you understand what you're really playing for?"



He moved past her then, leaving Camille with the unsettling sensation that she was missing something vital. Something that went beyond her carefully planned revenge. Something that Pierce could see but she couldn't, or wouldn't, acknowledge.


Across the room, Rose was already typing furiously on her phone, likely instructing her assistant to compile everything available about Victoria Kane's mysterious daughter. Her earlier dismissal clearly burned,but now calculation replaced humiliation in her expression. She had always excelled at turning setbacks into opportunities.


###Chapter 35



ALEXANDER POINT OF VIEW



The soft hum of my car's engine fills the silence as l watch the gallery entrance. Rain taps against the windows, turning the city lights into blurred stars. My thoughts keep returning to her - to the moment she collided with me outside that powder room, to the brief flash of raw emotion in her eyes before her careful mask slipped back into place.



Camille. Even her name feels different on my tongue now.



My security team thinks I'm obsessed. Maybe they're right. I've spent a year tracking her transformation,gathering every scrap of information about who she was before Victoria Kane molded her into this new creation. The photos tell a story Victoria doesn't understand, a story of survival, not victimhood.



I pull up an old photo on my phone. Camille Lewis at her engagement party, standing slightly behind Rose while Stefan's attention clearly drifted toward her sister. Even then, something in her eyes spoke of quiet strength. They never saw it. Never recognized what they were trying to break.


But I see it. I've always seen it.


The gallery doors open, spilling light andlaughter onto the wet sidewalk. The city's elite emerge in their designer clothes, diamonds catching streetlight as they hurry to waiting cars. I watch them with the detachment years of wealth have taught me. Their social games seem small now, measured against the chess match unfolding between Victoria Kane and her created heir.



Movement catches my eye, a flash of emerald silk.Camille appears in the doorway, and my breath catches despite myself. She moves with deliberate grace, each step precisely placed. Victoria's training shows in her posture, her gestures, the careful way she acknowledges the society matrons calling goodnight.



But there's something else. Something uniquely her own that shines through the polish and refinement.I lean forward slightly, studying how the rain mists her face. She declines her driver's offered umbrella, tilts her head back slightly to feel the water. Such a small act of defiance, but it reveals everything Victoria's careful programming hasn't erased.



The real Camille still lives beneath the surgical alterations and social training. Still burns with a fire they couldn't extinguish.
My mind drifts back to our encounter. The slight tremor in her hands when I steadied her. The sharp intake of breath when I mentioned family reunions.The way her eyes widened for just a moment when l hinted at knowing her true identity. She's fascinating,a study in controlled passion, in strength forged through pain.


Rose and Stefan emerge shortly after, lost in their own world of smug satisfaction. They pass within feet of Camille, never recognizing the woman they destroyed. The woman who rose from their betrayal to become something far more dangerous than they could imagine.


My fingers tighten on the steering wheel. Their casual cruelty, their unthinking arrogance, it awakens something dark in me. Something that recognizes the wounds they inflicted because | carry similar scars.We're alike in that way, Camille and I. We've both learned to transform pain into power.


But Victoria doesn't understand what she's created.She thinks she's crafting a weapon, an instrument of precise revenge. She doesn't see that Camille is becoming something far more significant. Something that transcends mere vengeance.



I've built my empire watching people, reading the patterns others miss. Every facial expression, every gesture, every careful word tells a story if you know how to interpret it. Camille's story fascinates me more than any I've encountered in years.


The way she maintains perfect composure while fire burns in her eyes. How she wields her new identity like armor while keeping her true self carefully guarded.The subtle tells that reveal her struggle between justice and mercy, between the woman she was and the one she's becoming.



Her car pulls up to the curb. Through the rain-streaked window, I watch her check her surroundings one last time, a habit Victoria must have drilled into her. But there's natural vigilance there too,instincts honed by betrayal.


The society papers call her Victoria Kane's mysterious heir. The business world speculates about her sudden appearance and rapid rise. They're all missing the real story. Missing the strength that radiates from her like heat from a flame.



I saw it the first time I encountered her photo in the financial press. Something in her eyes called to me,awakened recognition. I've spent months unraveling her mystery, understanding the intricate game Victoria plays. But my interest goes beyond professional curiosity now.



Every report I receive, every detail my team uncovers,only deepens my fascination. She's not just surviving the transformation Victoria forced on her, she's reshaping herself into something extraordinary.Something that outshines the destiny Victoria planned



The rain falls harder as her car pulls away from the curb. I start my engine but remain parked, watching the red taillights fade into the wet darkness. My security captain would disapprove of this behavior,this personal interest in what should be just another business rival.



But he doesn't understand. None of them do. They see surface details, the surgical changes, the careful training,the calculated revenge. They don't recognize the woman beneath it all. The one who refused to break when everything she loved was stripped away.



Let Victoria play her games. Let Rose and Stefan celebrate their victory, thinking they destroyed her.They don't realize what's coming. What Camille is becoming.



But I do. And I'll be there when she finally understands that revenge isn't enough. That she's meant for something greater than Victoria's careful plans Something I glimpsed in her eyes tonight when our gazes met.



The city blurs beyond my windshield, lights bleeding into shadows. In the quiet dark of my car, surrounded by the soft sound of rain, I make a promise to the woman who has awakened something long dormant in my soul.



"I will protect you with everything that I have got,little Camille."
###Chapter 36



Camille's point of view



There's a particular satisfaction in watching something fall apart from a distance, in witnessing the precise moment when confidence shatters and reality crashes down. Victoria had taught me that. "True power isn't in the destruction itself," she'd told me once, "but in knowing you orchestrated it while they never saw you coming." As I sat at the head of the conference table in Kane industries' executive boardroom,I savored that lesson, watching the faces of Pacific Maritime's leadership crumble under the weight of their impending ruin.



I watched the numbers change on my tablet as Pacific Maritime's stock price plummeted. Each drop represented another piece of Stefan's empire crumbling. The company's board members sat across from me in Kane Industries' main conference room,their faces growing paler by the minute.



"Your company lost forty percent of its value in the last hour," I said, my voice carrying through the silent room. "In fifteen minutes, when the market fully reacts to the news about your accounting irregularities, that number will hit sixty percent."



Michael Chen,Pacific Maritime's CEO, gripped his water glass so hard I thought it might shatter."These accusations are baseless."


"Are they?" I slid a folder across the polished table."Our audit team spent six months combing through your records. Every questionable contract, every hidden payment, every secret deal with Rodriguez Shipping- it's all there."


The board members exchanged worried glances. They knew what this meant. Pacific Maritime controlled Stefan's mostimportant shipping routes.Without them,his entire operation would collapse.



"Kane Industries is offering to buy your remaining shares at thirty dollars each," I continued. "Generous,considering they'll be worth nothing by market close."



"You can't do this," Thomas Rodriguez, Stefan's uncle and Pacific Maritime chairman, pushed back from the table. "Rodriguez Shipping will fight-"


"With what resources?" | cut him off. "The Rodriguez company is already overextended. Three banks have quietly frozen there credit lines. And their upcoming wedding is draining what cash reserves remain."



My phone buzzed-a message from our source inside Rodriguez Shipping: *Stefan just got the news.
Complete meltdown in his office. Board calling emergency meeting.*


I allowed myself a small smile. Let him rage. Let him feel powerless. Let him understand exactly what it meant to watch everything slip through his fingers.



"You have thirty minutes to accept our offer," I told the board. "After that, these findings go to the SEC and every major financial publication."



"This is extortion," Chen protested weakly.


"No, Mr. Chen. This is karma." I met his eyes steadily."You chose to tie your company's future to Rodriguez Shipping. Now you pay the price for that choice."


My phone lit up with updates from our trading desk.Pacific Maritime's stock in free fall. Investors dumping shares in panic. The trap I'd spent months setting had snapped shut perfectly.



The company's chief counsel spoke up. "We need time to review-"



"Twenty-eight minutes now,"I interrupted. "Tick tock."



In my earpiece, Victoria's voice: "Well done. They're crumbling exactly as predicted."



I kept my expression neutral as the board members whispered urgently among themselves. Six months of  planning had led to this moment. Every detail mapped out, every weakness exposed, every escape route blocked.



My tablet chimed again, Rodriguez Shipping's stock starting to drop as news spread about Pacific Maritime's troubles. The first domino falling exactly as planned.



"This will destroy him," Thomas Rodriguez said quietly "My nephew... his whole future depends on these shipping routes."



"Perhaps he should have thought about his future before making certain choices," I replied, letting ice coat my words. "Actions have consequences, Mr.Rodriguez. Even for those who think themselves untouchable."



Twenty minutes later, they signed the papers. Kane Industries now owned controlling interest in Pacific Maritime. Stefan's most crucial supply chain partner had fallen into enemy hands.



In my private bathroom afterward,I finally allowed my hands to shake. Not from fear or doubt, but from the pure rush of power. I'd done it. Landed the first major blow in my campaign to systematically dismantle everything Stefan valued.



My phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number: *Impressive show. But what happens when winning doesn't fill the void? - AP*





Alexander Pierce. Of course he'd been watching.He seemed to see everything these days.






I ignored his message, focusing instead on the news alerts flooding my screen. Business publications already running stories about Pacific Maritime's sudden takeover. Financial analysts speculating about what this meant for Rodriguez Shipping's future.



Victoria entered without knocking. "The board is pleased.Clean execution,minimal exposure,maximum damage."



"Stefan's company will lose forty percent of its shipping capacity overnight," I reported. "His stock is already down twelve percent."



"And how do you feel?"



I considered the question carefully. "Powerful. In control." I paused. "Empty."






"That passes," she said dismissively. "Focus on the next target. We move on Jensen Partners tomorrow - their infrastructure supports another thirty percent of his operations."


But as she outlined the next phase of our plan, I found myself wo ndering about Pierce's question. What would happen when I'd taken everything? When Stefan's empire lay in ruins and Rose's fashion dreams were ashes? Would the void inside me finally fill?


My reflection in the bathroom mirror showed nothing of these doubts. Just the polished exterior of Camille Kane, Victoria's perfect heir,methodically destroying her enemies.



I straightened my jacket and checked my lipstick.The afternoon would bring meetings with Pacific Maritime's new management team. Orders to be given.Changes to be implemented. Each step carefully designed to tighten the noose around Stefan's corporate neck.



I gathered my papers and headed for the next meeting.There was more work to be done. More pieces to position. More of Stefan's carefully built world to tear down.



Tomorrow would bring new targets, new strategies,new victories. But today... today I had drawn first blood.



And it was only the beginning.
###Chapter 37


Stefan hurled his crystal tumbler against the wall of his home office. The sound of shattering glass matched the chaos in his mind. Forty percent. His company stock hnad dropped forty percent in a single day.Billionswiped out in hours.



His phone kept buzzing, board members, investors, his father. All demanding answers he didn't have.How had Kane Industries outmaneuvered them so completely?The takeover of Pacific Maritime shouldn't have been possible. Their defenses had been solid. Their contracts secured.



Yet here he sat, watching his family's legacy crumble through real-time stock updates on his phone screen.Each notification drove the knife deeper.



"Darling?" Rose's voice drifted through his office door.

"Can we talk about the wedding plans? The planner needs final numbers for-"



"Not now." His voice came ouut harsh, rough from hours of emergency calls.



She entered anyway, dressed for the evening in a red designer dress that probably cost more than his employees made in a month. "The venue won't hold our date forever. We need to confirmn..."



"The date?" Stefan spun to face her, rage boiling over "You want to discuss wedding dates while my company burns? While everything my family built over generations disappears?"



Rose stepped back, unused to seeing this side of him "Thebusiness troubles are temporary.Your father will..."



"My father?" He laughed, a bitter sound that scared even himself. "My father hasn't returned my calls since the stock crash. The board is meeting tomorrow to discuss my removal as CEO. And you want to talk about flower arrangements?"



"Stefan, please." She moved toward him, reaching for his arm. "We'll figure this out. Kane Industries can't..."


"Kane Industries." The name tasted like poison on his tongue. "That woman... there's something about her.Something familiar that I can't place."


"Camille Kane? Don't be ridiculous. She's lived in Europe most of her life. We only met her recently at..."



"I know what she told us!" His fist slammed the desk,making Rose jump. "But every time I see her, every time she speaks... it's like a memory I can't quite grab."
Rose's expression shifted, something calculating replacing her previous concern. "Perhaps you're attracted to her? It would explain your obsession."



The suggestion hit him like ice water. "This isn't about attraction. This is about our entire future disappearing while you plan parties and pick out china patterns!"



"Our future depends on maintaining appearances,"Rose snapped back. "The right wedding, the right guests, the right connections...."



"Connections?" Stefan advanced on her, forcing her to step back. "Is that what I am to you? A connection?A stepping stone for your social climbing?"


"Don't be absurd. I love you. I've always..."


"Always?" Another harsh laugh. "You mean since London? Since you came back and found me married to your sister?"



The words hung between them, heavy with unspoken accusations. Rose's face paled slightly.


"We agreed not to discuss Camille," she said quietly."Not after... everything."


"Everything." Stefan turned away, unable to look at her. "Such a nice, clean word for what happened. For what we did."
His phone buzzed again. Another stock alert. Another drop. The numbers blurred before his eyes.



"We should postpone the wedding announcement,"he said finally. "Until the company stabilizes."


"Postpone?" Roše's voice rose sharply. "We can't postpone! The society papers already..."



"Damn the society papers!" He whirled back to face her. "Don't you understand? I'm losing everything! My position, my family's respect, my entie future! And all you care about is your precious social standing?"



Tears filled her eyes, but Stefan had seen her cry too many times to trust them now. "That's unfair. I'm trying to help..."



"Help?" His voice dropped dangerously low. "Like you helped Camille? Is that the kind of help you're offering?"



The color drained from Rose's face. For a moment,real fear flickered in her eyes. "You promised never to bring that up."



"I'm breaking a lot of promises lately." Stefan moved to his bar, reaching for another glass. "Seems to run in our relationship."



Rose watched him pour,her perfectly manicured nails digging into her palms. "What do you want me to say?
That I'm sorry? That I wish things had been different?"


"I want you to care!" The words exploded from him."Care about something real! Something beyond your next social event or magazine feature!"


"I care about you," she whispered.


"Do you?" He met her eyes in the bar's mirror. "Or do you care about what I represent? The name, the position,the lifestyle?"


She had no answer. Or perhaps, her silence was answer enough.



"Go home, Rose." Stefan drained his glass in one swallow. "I need to work. Need to find some way to save what's left of my company while I still can."



"Stefan,please...."



"Go." He didn't turn around. Couldn't bear to see whatever performance she'd prepared. "We'll discuss the wedding...later."



Her heels clicked across his office floor, each step precise despite her emotional display. At the door, she paused.



"I do love you," she said softly. "In my way."



Stefan kept his eyes on the city lights beyond his window. "Your way," he replied, equally soft. "That's always been the problem, hasn't it?"



The door closed behind her with a quiet click. In the sudden silence, his phone buzzed one final time.After -hours trading in Asia pushing his stock even lower.



He poured another drink, mind returning to Camille Kane. To that nagging sense of recognition. To the way she'd looked at him across the conference room,like she could see right through him.



Like she knew all his secrets.



Like she knew him.



The thought sent a chill down his spine that not even expensive scotch could warm.
###Chapter 38



Camille's point of view



I sat in my private office at Kane Industries, watching six screens track different aspects of my plan to destroy Rodriguez Shipping. Each monitor told part of the story, stock prices, trading volumes, news alerts,social media sentiment, competitor reactions, and internal communications we'd managed to intercept.One year of meticulous preparation leading to this pivotal moment. The leather of my executive chair creaked softly as I leaned forward, my reflection in the darkened glass showing a woman I sometimes barely recognized.



"Ready?" Victoria asked from the doorway,her tailored charcoal suit as impeccable as always. Her eyes gleamed with the predatory anticipation I'd come to recognize over our months working together.



"Everything's in position." I pulled up the final numbers, watching as our algorithms predicted the coming cascade. "Our traders are standing by in London, New York, and Singapore. The evidence of Rodriguez Shipping's safety violations hits the press in exactly four minutes and twenty-three seconds."
She moved to stand behind my chair, studying the screens with the careful attention of a general reviewing battle plans. Her subtle perfume, always jasmine with notes of sandalwood, filled the air between us. "And the backup plan?"


"Three different whistleblowers will contact financial reporters about questionable accounting practices at precisely staggered intervals. The evidence has already been planted in their internal systems,backdated appropriately, and verified by our technical team." I tapped a sequence on my keyboard, bringing up another window showing the pre-written exposés."If they somehow weather the safety scandal, the financial improprieties will finish them."


My hands stayed steady as I typed final commands into the trading system, muscle memory from countless simulations we'd run. Inside, emotions warred, satisfaction, pain, a strange kind of grief for the company I'd once thought would be mine to help run,alongside the family I thought would become my own. The diamond on my left hand had been gone for months now, but sometimes I still felt its phantom weight.



"First article just dropped," Victoria noted as alerts started flashing across the primary monitor."Wall Street Journal. 'Major Safety Concerns Plague Rodriguez Shipping Fleet: Internal Documents Reveal Years of Neglect.'"


I allowed myself a small, controlled smile as other notifications followed in rapid succession. Reuters.Bloomberg. Financial Times. CNBC breaking news.Each one sharing damaging details we'd carefully leaked through untraceable channels.Each one driving the stock price lower, triggering automated sell algorithms across institutional investors' systems.



"Trading volume spiking," my head trader reported through the speaker, his voice betraying the excitement he was trying to contain. "Up four hundred percent above normal. Major institutional investors starting to sell. BlackRock just dumped twelve percent of their position."



On my main screen, Rodriguez Shipping's stock chart turned bright red, the downward trajectory steepening with each passing second. Down five percent. Then twelve. Then twenty. A freefall gaining speed with every passing minute, accelerated by high-frequency trading programs reacting to the negative press.



My phone buzzed - a message from our source inside the company: *Total chaos here. Stefan locked in emergency board meeting. Conference room screens showing stock collapse. His father just arrived looking furious. Security doubled on executive floor.*



"Time for phase two," Victoria said quietly, a manicured nail tapping the edge of my desk in perfect rhythm with the declining stock ticker.



I nodded, sending the encrypted signal to our trading team positioned around the globe. Kane Industries would start quietly buying shares through a complex network of shell companies,but only after driving the price down further. By day's end, we'd own enough to demand board seats, placing us in the perfect position to dismantle the company from within.



More alerts filled my screens in a cascade of digital destruction. Industry analysts questioning the company's future viability. Suppliers nervously reviewing contracts. Customers making backup plans with competitors. Credit agencies placing Rodriguez Shipping on watch for potential downgrade.



"Thirty percent drop," Victoria noted with undisguised satisfaction, her reflection in my monitor showing the slight smile she reserved for victories. "The margin calls will start soon. Their creditors won't wait."



She was right. Rodriguez Shipping had leveraged their assets heavily for the Asian expansion Stefan had championed against his father's wishes. As the stock price fell, their loan covenants would trigger,forcing immediate repayment. A cascade of financial disaster we'd carefully engineered, exploiting the hidden weaknesses I'd learned about during intimate dinners and family meetings.
My phone buzzed again: *Stefan's father just walked out of the board meeting. Never seen him so angry.Screaming about family legacy destroyed. Three generations of work ruined. Stefan looks shell-shocked. CFO in tears.*



I should have felt only triumph. This was what I'd planned,systematic destruction of everything Stefan valued. But memories kept intruding unbidden. His father's pride when giving me a tour of their flagship vessels. Family dinners where he'd treated me like the daughter he never had. All fake, all conditional on me being the perfect wife to his perfect son. All dissolved the moment I became inconvenient, unnecessary,replaceable.



A notification from our banking contacts appeared: *Rodriguez seeking emergency credit line. Multiple rejections already.*


"Ms. Kane?" My assistant's voice through the intercom,professional as always despite the financial bloodbath playing out on our screens. "Mr. Rodriguez Senior is attempting to contact you directly. He's called three times in the last five minutes."



Victoria's eyes narrowed slightly. "Desperation sets in quickly."






"Block the calls," I replied, voice cool despite the turmoil inside. "And inform security that no Rodriguez family member is to be admitted to the building under any circumstances."



The financial carnage continued as more investors abandoned what was clearly becoming a sinking ship.News channels began running special segments on the "Rodriguez Collapse," featuring experts we'd quietly briefed in advance.



Fresh alerts flooded my screens. Rodriguez Shipping's board had called an emergency session. Rumors of Stefan's possible removal as CEO spread through financial circles. Trading halts triggered then lifted,each resumption bringing another wave of selling.



"Forty percent drop," Victoria announced with clear satisfaction, pouring two glasses of the eighteen-year -old Macallan she kept in my office for special occasions. "WVell done, Camille. Absolutely masterful execution."



I accepted the glass but didn't drink, watching instead as our source continued to provide real-time updates from inside the Rodriguez headquarters.


More messages appeared: *Stefan's office being cleared out. Personal items in boxes. Security escorting him from building. Executive team in complete meltdown. Legal team preparing for shareholder lawsuits.*
I stared at the words until they blurred together.Remembered Stefan's boyish pride in his family's company during our first dates. His passionate late-night talks about modernizing the fleet. The dreams he'd shared late at night about expanding their legacy across new shipping lanes, new countries, new possibilities. The way his eyes lit up when discussing the business in a way they never quite did when discussing our future together.


All ash now. All destroyed by my hand, methodically,deliberately, without mercy, just as he'd destroyed me.



"Incoming call from Margaret Lewis," my assistant announced through the intercom, interrupting my thoughts.



My mother. Probably calling to beg for help with Rose's failing fashion line, unaware of the irony. She had no idea she was speaking to her lost daughter while her chosen one's world crumbled into dust. I wondered briefly what she would think if she knew the truth, that the daughter she'd discarded was now powerful enough to crush businesses with a few keystrokes.



"Decline," I said sharply, watching Rodriguez stock hit another circuit breaker.



Victoria sipped her whiskey, watching me over the rim of her glass with the calculating gaze that had first drawn me to her after my world collapsed. "After this,there will be no going back. You understand that?Once the Rodriguez name is destroyed, many doors will close to you forever."



"Those doors closed the moment Stefan and Rose decided to betray me," I replied, finally tasting the aged whiskey, letting it burn down my throat. "I'm simply making it official."



"The market closes in ten minutes," Victoria said,glancing at her watch. "Tomorrow we start on their Asia division. By week's end..."


"By week's end they'll have nothing left," I cut in,watching each percentage point drop with a hollow satisfaction. "Isn't that the point? Complete annihilation?"



On screen, Rodriguez Shipping's stock hit bottom again. Trading halted for the fourth time. Stefan's legacy ended not with a bang but with a whimper and a lot of red numbers. The five-year chart showed a perfect cliff edge, everything before today rendered meaningless.


My phone buzzed one final time. A photo from our source, Stefan being escorted out, box of personal items in his arms, face pale with shock and disbelief.The golden boy finally facing consequences.The heir apparent dethroned. The man who had promised me forever now facing his own sudden ending.


I'd done this. Me. The woman he'd discarded like yesterday's news. The wife he'd betrayed with her own sister. The inconvenient obstacle to his true desires.



So why didn't victory taste sweeter? Why did the whiskey turn bitter on my tongue? Why did the emptiness inside seem to grow rather than diminish?



Victoria studied me carefully, her years of experience reading people picking up on my unexpected hesitation. "You're not having second thoughts, are you? After everything we've done to get here?"



"Not second thoughts," I said, setting down my glass."Just wondering what comes after."



"After?" Victoria raised a perfectly shaped eyebrow."After this, we continue with the plan. Rose's fashion empire. Your mother's social standing. One by one,we dismantle everything they value, everything they chose over you."



I nodded slowly, but something inside me questioned whether endless destruction would ever fill the void their betrayal had created. "And then what? When it's all gone, what remains for me?"


Victoria's sigh held years of experience, both professional and personal. "Just remember why we started this. What they did to you. What they deserve.
How they would have continued using you if you hadn't discovered the truth."



"I remember everything," I said softly, touching the screen where Stefan's broken expression was captured forever. "That's the problem."



The final trading bell rang, the sound echoing through my office like a death knell. Rodriguez Shipping's stock closed down sixty-two percent, the worst single -day performance in the company's century-long history.Headlines already proclaimed the death of a shipping dynasty that had survived wars, depressions,and global crises, but couldn't survive my vengeance.



I'd won. Thoroughly. Completely. Just as planned.


My phone began buzzing incessantly, financial reporters seeking comment, business associates offering congratulations, vultures seeking to pick at the Rodriguez carcass. I silenced it without looking at the names.



Tomorrow would bring new targets, new strategies,new victories. But tonight... tonight I would sit alone with my thoughts, the taste of ash in my mouth despite the expensive whiskey, and consider what exactly came after revenge. When all the destruction was complete, when everyone who had hurt me was brought low, what would I build from the ruins of my former life?
It was a question I hadn't allowed myself to consider until now, focused solely on tearing down rather than building up. Perhaps it was time to start thinking beyond vengeance, beyond the all-consuming fire that had driven me these past months.


Perhaps there was something waiting for me on the other side of revenge.

###Chapter 39



Stefan stared at the empty boardroom seats, his hands shaking as he reached for another glass of water. The morning's board meeting felt like a firing squad,twelve angry faces demanding explanations he didn't have. Someone was systematically destroying Rodriguez Shipping, but he couldn't figure out who or why.



"The numbers are disastrous," Andrew Parker, head of the finance committee, said coldly. "Sixty-two percent stock drop. Major contracts vanishing.Suppliers backing out. And you still can't tell us what's happening?"



"I've had every analyst working around the clock,"Stefan replied, hating the weakness in his voice. "The attacks are coming from multiple directions. Every time we plug one hole, three more appear."



"Attacks?" Parker's laugh held no warmth. "Or just incompetence?"



Other board members muttered in agreement. Three hours of defending himself, showing reports,promising solutions - none of it mattered. They wanted his head.



"A vote has been called," Thomas Chen announced,his voice heavy with false regret. "On the immediate removal of Stefan Rodriguez as Chief Executive Officer of Rodriguez Shipping International."


Stefan's stomach turned to ice. This wasn't happening.The company had survived world wars, economic crashes, countless crises. Now it was crumbling and he couldn't even identify the enemy.


"All in favor..."



The boardroom doors flew open. Eduardo Rodriguez filled the doorway, commanding attention without speaking a word. Stefan had never been so grateful to see his father.



"This meeting is suspended," Eduardo announced,moving to the head of the table. "By authority of the family's controlling shares."



Parker stood, face flushed. "Mr. Rodriguez, with respect, the board has authority to..."


"The board has what authority I permit it to have."Eduardo's voice could have frozen fire."Right now, I'm permitting you all to leave while I speak with my son."


Nobody moved.
"That wasn't a suggestion." Eduardo's eyes swept the room. "Out. All of you."


They filed out slowly, Parker throwing Stefan a look that promised this wasn't finished. When the door closed, silence fell heavy between father and son.


"You're a disappointment." Eduardo's words cut deep."But you're still my son. Still a Rodriguez."


Stefan stared at his hands. "Someone's targeting us.Every move we make, they're three steps ahead. It's like they know our playbook better than we do."


"Because you're too busy planning a wedding to see what's right in front of you." His father moved to the window. "Too focused on that Lewis girl to protect what generations built."


"Rose has nothing to do with-"


"Rose has everything to do with it." Eduardo turned,eyes hard. "Ever since you divorced Camille..."


"Don't." Stefan's voice cracked. "Please don't bring her into this."



"Why not? She understood business. Understood loyalty. Then she has some convenient accident and suddenly you're engaged to her sister?" His father's eyes narrowed. "Even I can see something wrong there."



Stefan's chest tightened. If his father knew the truth about Camille...about what really happened that night..
2

"The board wants you gone," Eduardo continued."They're not wrong. You've let someone gut this company piece by piece."


"I know." The words tasted like ash. "I'll resign. Save everyone the trouble of voting."



"No."



Stefan looked up, confused. "No?"



"You're my son." Eduardo's voice softened slightly."Despite everything, you're my blood. I've convinced the board to give you one month."


Hope flickered faintly. "One month?"2


"To find who's behind this. To save what's left. To prove you deserve the Rodriguez name." His father's expression hardened again. "But there are conditions."


Of course there were. There always were with Eduardo Rodriguez.



"What conditions?"



"First,postpone this wedding circus. No distractions."

Stefan nodded slowly. Rose wouldn't like it, but she'd have to understand.



"Second,you move back to the family estate. I want you focused, where I can watch you work."


Another nod. Easier than the first condition.



"Third," Eduardo paused, "you tell me the truth about Camille's accident. Everything you know."



Stefan's blood turned to ice. "What do you mean?"


"I'm not a fool, son. The timing was too convenient.The body never found. And now you're marrying her sister?" Eduardo's eyes bore into him. "What really happened to your wife?"


The question that haunted his nightmares. The truth he'd buried under grief and guilt and Rose's careful manipulations.


"I... I don't know everything," he said carefully."There were things... suggestions... but nothing certain."


"Then you have one month to find certainty." Eduardo moved to the door. "The board returns in five minutes.They'll announce the probation period. Thirty days to save this company and find who's trying to destroy us."


He paused, hand on the doorknob. "And Stefan?
Something tells me these attacks and Camille's disappearance might be connected. Think about who would want both you and this company destroyed."



The board members filed back in, taking their seats with obvious reluctance. Parker especially looked ready to object, but Eduardo's presence kept him silent.



"Gentlemen," Eduardo addressed them. "My son has thirty days to reverse our losses. If he fails, I'll personally request his removal. If he succeeds, we all benefit. Did you all agree?"


One by one, they nodded. Not happy, but unwilling to fight Eduardo Rodriguez when he used that tone.


"Thirty days," Parker said, glaring at Stefan. "Not one day more."


Stefan barely heard the rest of the meeting. His mind kept spinning with questions. Who had the resources and motivation to attack them so precisely? Why did every defensive move fail before it started? How did the enemy always know exactly where to strike?


And underneath it all, his father's words about Camille kept echoing. About finding the truth. About connections he hadn't let himself consider.



His phone buzzed, Rose asking about wedding venue deposits. He ignored it.
Thirty days to save his family's legacy. To uncover the truth about his wife's disappearance. To face whatever Rose had been hiding all this time.



Somehow,he didn't think he could do both.
###Chapter 40



The morning sun painted golden streaks across Alexander's office atop Pierce International. Sixty stories above Manhattan, the city stretched beneath him, a vast, glittering chessboard where every piece moved according to unseen plans. From this height,everything seemed distant, almost insignificant,except for the battles being fought in silence, the wars waged behind closed doors, and the people who thought they controlled their own fates.


Alexander sat back in his leather chair, adjusting his posture as he waited for his secretary's daily briefing.The chair creaked softly under his weight, the only sound in the vast office aside from the faint hum of the city below.


A precise knock on the door announced Sarah's arrival. She was never late. She stepped in,her heels clicking against the polished marble floor, holding her tablet in one hand.



"Good morning, sir," she greeted professionally,stopping a few feet from his desk.


Alexander nodded, wordlessly gesturing for her to begin.


Sarah had worked for him long enough to understand his moods. Some days, he wanted every detail; other days, he only wanted the highlights. Today, she could tell from his quiet, watchful expression that something occupied his mind, but that didn't change her job.



She cleared her throat and glanced at her notes."Rodriguez Shipping's board meeting just ended."Her voice was calm, but there was a slight pause before she continued. "Stefan received an unexpected reprieve. His father intervened before the final vote to remove him as CEO."



Alexander's fingers tapped a slow rhythm against his armrest. His gaze didn't waver, but his mindwas already calculating the consequences. "Details."


Sarah swiped on her tablet. "Eduardo Rodriguez used the family's controlling shares to force a compromise.The board wanted Stefan out, but Eduardo gave him a final chance. He has one month to fix the company's problems, or he will be removed permanently."


Alexander let out a soft, knowing hum. "And the board agreed?"


"They weren't happy, but no one argues with Eduardo Rodriguez," Sarah replied. "Stefan's position is weak.If he fails in the next thirty days, even his father won't be able to protect him."



Alexander leaned back slightly, contemplating the situation.Stefan was drowning, barely holding on, and the vultures were circling. Victoria Kane wouldn't let this opportunity go to waste.


"And Camille Kane's next move?"



Sarah's lips curved slightly, almost in admiration. "Our sources say she's planning another attack on their stock. Analysts predict she will target their Asian shipping routes. If she succeeds, Rodriguez Shipping will lose a major market share, and their stock will crash even further."



It was an elegant move, brutal, effective, and perfectly timed. Camille had no intention of giving Stefan a chance to recover. She was determined to crush him completely.


Alexander nodded slowly, the pieces falling into place.He had no personal interest in Stefan Rodriguez,but Camille, Victoria Kane's so-called adopted daughter,was different. She was the only reason he was paying attention.



He had seen something in her eyes that Victoria had missed. Revenge could destroy a person from the inside out. "Have our team assist Kane Industries with their next market move," Alexander said at last. "Quietly. Make sure no connection can be traced back to us."



Sarah looked up, clearly surprised. In five years working for him, she had never heard him suggest helping Kane Industries.


"Sir?" She hesitated. "We've never involved ourselves in their operations before."


"Times change," he said simply.


He reached for his desk drawer and pulled out a small velvet box. It was old but well cared for, the edges slightly worn from years of handling. Inside lay a delicate silver necklace with a rose-shaped pendant.As the morning light touched it, the silver glowed softly.


Sarah's eyes flickered with curiosity. She had seen Alexander handle many rare, priceless items over the years,but this, this was different. There was something personal about it.


"Keep this between us," Alexander said, his voice quieter now. "No paper trail. No electronic records."


"Of course, sir." Sarah hesitated, then asked cautiously,"May I ask why we're helping Victoria Kane? She has always been one of our strongest rivals." Alexander didn't answer immediately. Instead, he lifted the necklace, letting the pendant spin slightly between his fingers, catching the light.



"We're not helping Victoria," he finally said. His gaze remained fixed on the pendant. "We're helping someone else."



Sarah was sharp, one of the reasons he trusted her.She put the pieces together quickly. "Ms. Kane's daughter?" she asked softly. "The one who appeared so suddenly?"



Alexander didn't reply. His mind was already elsewhere,six years in the past, in a hospital room filled with the scent of antiseptic and the low hum of machines.



Pain. Darkness. Isolation.



He had been on the edge of death, abandoned by his family,left to rot. But then....


A soft voice. A gentle touch. Someone carefully changing his bandages, reading to him when the pain made sleep impossible.


She had never told him her real name.



She had paid for his medical bills when no one else cared. And then, she disappeared.


Now, she had returned, wearing a different name and face, Camille Kane. She burned with the need for vengeance,completely unaware that the man she had once saved was watching over her from the shadows.


"Send our best analysts to support Kane Industries next move," Alexander instructed. He carefully returned the necklace to its box. "Whatever resources they need. Just ensure our involvement remains invisible."



"Yes, sir." Sarah typed a final note before pausing at the door. "Anything else?"


"That's all."



She nodded and turned to leave, but before she stepped out, Alexander added, "And Sarah?"



She glanced back.



"If anyone asks why we're suddenly interested in Rodriguez Shipping's troubles..."



"I'll remind them that we never discuss your personal projects." A faint smile touched her lips. "Don't worry,sir. Your secret is safe."



The door closed behind her, leaving Alexander alone with the morning light and his memories.



Slowly, he removed the necklace from the box again,holding it up to the light. The rose pendant spun gently,reflecting fractured sunlight across his desk.


Six years.He had carried it for

Six years, waiting for the moment to return it to its rightful owner.





Waiting for the chance to repay a debt that went far beyond money.





Now,she was Camille Kane, cold and ruthless, chasing revenge against those who had wronged her.


But beneath that anger, beneath the walls she had built, he still saw traces of the gentle soul who had once sat beside his hospital bed.


The girl who had saved him when he had no one else.



The girl who had unknowingly become a piece of his past that he could never let go.





"Little Camille," he murmured, watching the sunlight dance through the silver curves.





His voice was barely a whisper, lost in the vast office.



"| hope this path doesn't consume you."
###Chapter 41



Camille's point of view


The Metropolitan Finance Summit filled the grand ballroom of the Plaza Hotel, crystal chandeliers casting golden light over Manhattan's elite. I moved through the crowd with practiced grace, my black Dior dress drawing appreciative glances. Every step,every gesture, every smile carefully calculated to project the image of Victoria Kane's perfect heir.


Inside,though,my mind raced with numbers and plans.Rodriguez Shipping's Asia division lay vulnerable after our last attack. Tonight's event offered perfect hunting grounds, worried investors ready to jump ship,competitors eager to grab market share, reporters hungry for insider tips.


"Searching for your next victim, Ms. Kane?"


Alexander's voice behind me sent an unexpected shiver down my spine. I hadn't heard him approach,unusual for someone trained by Victoria to always track potential threats. But Alexander Pierce had a way of slipping past my defenses.
"Mr. Pierce." I turned, finding him closer than expected "I didn't think finance summits were your preferred hunting ground."



"They aren't." His gray eyes held that knowing look that always made me feel exposed. "But I heard interesting rumors about Rodriguez Shipping's stock taking quite a tumble. Tragic."



His tone suggested he knew exactly how tragic it wasn't. I kept my expression neutral despite my racing heart. "The market can be unpredictable."


"Can it?" He accepted two champagne glasses from a passing waiter, offering me one with elegant precision. "Nothing about you seems unpredictable,Ms. Kane. Every move..." his eyes met mine over the rim of his glass, "perfectly calculated."


The way he emphasized 'perfectly' sent warning signals through my mind.How much did he really know?About my plans? About my true identity? About everything?



"You seem very interested in my movements, Mr.Pierce."



"Alexander," he corrected softly. "And yes, I find you..fascinating."


Heat crept up my neck, and I silently cursed my body's betrayal. This wasn't part of Victoria's careful programming. She hadn't prepared me for the way Alexander Pierce could unsettle my walls with just a look, just a word.


"Why fascinating?" I sipped my champagne,using the moment to steady myself.


His eyes never left mine. "Because beneath all this..."he gestured to my designer dress, my perfect makeup,my polished manner, "there's something real.Something true.Something that hasn't forgotten how to feel."



My hand tightened on the delicate champagne stem."You presume a lot about someone you barely know."


"Do l?" He stepped closer, his cologne teasing my senses. "Tell me, when Rodriguez Shipping's stock crashed today, did it satisfy the hunger inside you? Or did it just make you hungrier?"


Ice slid through my veins even as heat pooled in my stomach. He knew. Somehow he knew everything. But instead of fear,I felt...relief? Finally someone who saw through the mask, who understood the fire burning beneath my skin.


"I don't know what you're talking about."


"No?" His smile widened slightly. "Then why is your pulse racing? I can see it..." his eyes dropped to my throat, "right here."


I forced myself to step back, to remember my purpose. Victoria's training screamed at me to retreat,to maintain distance, to protect the mission. "You're very forward, Mr. Pierce."



"Alexander," he corrected again, following my retreat with a fluid step forward. "And you're very evasive,Camille. May I call you Camille?"


The way he said my name... like a caress... like a secret... made my skin tingle. No one said my name that way anymore. Not since I'd buried Camille Lewis and risen as Camille Kane.



"If you must."


"I must." He glanced around the crowded ballroom before leaning close to whisper, "Just like I must warn you,revenge is a fire that burns both ways. Be careful you don't lose yourself in the flames."


Before I could respond, he disappeared into the crowd with the same silent grace he'd appeared. I stood frozen, champagne forgotten in my hand, his words echoing in my mind.


The rest of the evening passed in a blur. I went through the motions, networking, gathering information, planting seeds for our next move against Stefan's company. But my mind kept returning to that moment with Alexander, to the way he'd seen straight through my carefully constructed facade.


Later, in my private car heading home, I found myself smiling despite the seriousness of his warning. The way he'd teased me, challenged me, understood me...it awakened something I thought had died when I let Victoria remake me.


My phone buzzed, a message from her confirming tomorrow's strategy meeting about Rodriguez Shipping's Asia division. I should have been focused on that, on the next phase of our plan, on the systematic destruction of Stefan's world.



Instead,I kept hearing Alexander's voice: "Something real.Something true."



When had anyone last seen me that way? Not as Victoria's creation, not as Stefan's ex-wife, not as Rose's forgotten sister, not as the Lewis forgotten heiress. Just... me.


My fingers touched my throat where he'd noticed my pulse racing. Even now, hours later, the memory of his gaze made my heart beat faster. The scent of his cologne lingered on my dress where he'd stood close - cedar and leather and something uniquely him.


Dangerous, Victoria's voice whispered in my mind.He's a distraction. A complication. Remember why we started this. Remember what they did to you.



But for the first time since Victoria saved me, since l buried my old self and became her heir, I wondered if complications might be exactly what I needed. If maybe, just maybe, there was more to life than revenge.



My phone buzzed again. Alexander this time: *Next time you plan to crash a stock, warn me.I do so enjoy watching you work.*


I caught myself smiling again, and this time I didn't try to stop it. Something warm unfurled in my chest,not the cold satisfaction of revenge, but something softer.Something that felt dangerously like hope.


Tomorrow would bring more battles, more strategies,more steps toward destroying those who had destroyed me. But tonight... tonight I let myself remember how it felt to be seen. Really seen.


My phone lit up with one final message from Alexander: *Sweet dreams, little warrior. Try not to topple any empires before breakfast.*


This time, my laugh surprised even me.

###Chapter 42



Rose stared at Stefan, the wedding invitation sample still clutched in her hand. The gold-embossed lettering seemed to mock her now.



"What do you mean, postponed?" Her voice came out too high,too tight.


Stefan loosened his tie, exhaustion etched into every line of his face. "Just what I said. We need to push the wedding back. Until things stabilize with the company."


"Push it back? Push it back?" The invitation crumpled in her grip. "We've sent save-the-dates to three hundred people. The venue is booked. The deposit is paid!"



"I know." Stefan moved to the bar, pouring himself a drink without offering her one. "My father made it a condition of his help with the company. No distractions. Full focus on saving what's left."


Rose watched him toss back expensive scotch like it was water. The careful control she'd maintained all these years began to slip. "Your father doesn't control our lives."
"He controls the board. He controls the family shares.Right now, he's the only thing standing between me and complete professional ruin." Stefan poured another drink. "It's just a few months. Once I save the company..."


"If you save the company," Rose corrected, her voice laced with venom. "Let's be honest, Stefan. Your business is sinking, and you have no idea who's behind it."



He flinched as if she'd slapped him. "Thanks for the vote of confidence."



"I'm being realistic." She advanced on him, the crushed invitation still in her hand. "We've planned this wedding for a year. A year! Everyone who matters in New York will be there. This is our moment,Stefan.Our time!"



"Our time?" He turned to face her, something hardening in his expression. "My company is crashing.My family legacy is at risk. And you're worried about a party?"



"A party?" The words came out as a strangled laugh."Is that what you think this is? Just a party?"



"Rose..."



She hurled the crumpled invitation at his head. It bounced harmlessly off his shoulder, but the action broke something loose inside her. All the careful planning, the years of manipulation, the patient waiting, all threatened by his weakness, his failure to protect what was his.


"Do you have any idea what I've done for this wedding?For us?" She grabbed a crystal vase from the side table, feeling its weight in her hands. "The people I've cultivated. The connections I've built. All to ensure our place in society!"



The vase shattered against the wall inches from his head,water and flowers exploding across imported wallpaper.



Stefan stared at her, shock replacing exhaustion."Jesus, Rose! What's wrong with you?"


"What's wrong with me?" She seized a framed photo of them, ripping it from the wall. "What's wrong with you? First you let someone destroy your company piece by piece, and now you're letting your father dictate our future?"



The frame joined the vase,glass flying across the room.


"Stop it!" Stefan grabbed for her arms, but she twisted away,snatching a bottle from the bar.



"After everything I did to have you," she hissed, "after everything I sacrificed...."

"What you sacrificed?" Stefan stepped back,something like suspicion dawning in his eyes. "What exactly did you sacrifice, Rose?"



The question hung between them, dangerous,unanswerable. For a moment, she froze,bottle raised mid-swing.



Then the rage took over again. The bottle smashed against the marble fireplace, alcohol spraying across family photos, across the custom rug they'd chosen together, across his perfect white shirt.



"I waited for you!" The words tore from her throat."While you played husband to my pathetic sister!While you built your little life with her! I waited!"


Each accusation accompanied another act of destruction. A crystal paperweight through the television screen. A chair overturned. Books swept from shelves.



Stefan backed away, watching her rampage with growing horror. "Rose, you need to calm down. This isn't about Camille..."



"Everything is about Camille!" she screamed,the name like poison on her tongue. "Poor, sweet Camille who everyone loved. Camille who got everything handed to her while I had to fight for every scrap!"


"She's gone, Rose." Stefan's voice held an edge she'd never heard before. "She's dead. And you're destroying our home over a postponed wedding."


Rose froze, breathing hard, surrounded by the wreckage of their perfect apartment. Something in his tone cut through her rage. Something knowing.Questioning.


"She's dead," Rose agreed, sudden caution threading through her anger. "And I'm your future. Not your father's company. Not your family legacy. Me."


She advanced on him again, broken glass crunching under her designer heels. "I've invested too much in us to postpone now. Too much time. Too much planning. Too many sacrifices."


Stefan stood his ground, studying her with new eyes."What exactly did you do, Rose? When Camille disappeared?"



The question struck like lightning, unexpected and searing. Had he suspected all along? Had he seen through her careful manipulations?


Rose forced her breathing to steady,her mind racing through the implications. "What are you asking me,Stefan?"



"Nothing." He looked away, the moment breaking.

"Nothing. Just... this isn't the Rose I know."


She laughed, the sound brittle and sharp. "Maybe you never knew me at all." 2



Silence fell between them, broken only by the sound of something expensive dripping onto the ruined carpet. Rose surveyed the destruction she'd caused,feeling no regret. Let him see this side of her. Let him understand what happened when people crossed her plans.



"The wedding is postponed," Stefan said finally, his voice flat. "My father gave me one month to save the company. After that, we can discuss dates again."


"One month." Rose smoothed her skirt, stepping over broken glass toward him. "And if you fail? If the company crashes completely?"


"Then we start over." He met her eyes. "Together. If that's still what you want."



The question hung between them, unexpected and revealing.



"Of course it's what I want." She reached for his face,cupping his cheek with one hand. "We're meant to be together, Stefan. We always were."



He caught her wrist,holding it just tight enough to be uncomfortable. "Then you'll wait. One month."
Something in his grip, in his eyes, warned her not to push further. The Stefan she'd manipulated so easily seemed suddenly absent, replaced by someone harder.Someone watchful.


"Fine." She twisted her wrist free. "One month. But when this is over, nothing stops our wedding. Not your father. Not your company. Nothing."


"Agreed." He moved past her toward the door. "I'll stay at the family estate tonight. Give you time to..calm down."



Rose watched him leave, not trusting herself to speak again. When the door closed behind him, she surveyed the destroyed apartment, broken glass glittering like diamonds across every surface.



Her phone buzzed, another message from the wedding planner asking about flower arrangements.With a scream of pure frustration, she hurled it against the wall, watching it shatter like everything else in her perfect life.


One month. She could wait one month. She'd waited years to have Stefan, played a long, patient game.What was one more month?



But as she stood amid the wreckage of their home,a new fear crept through her rage. The way Stefan had looked at her. The questions about Camille. The sudden hardening in his manner.



For the first time since Camille's "accident," Rose wondered if her carefully constructed world might be built on shifting sand.

###Chapter 43



Camille's point of view



The Metropolitan Museum sparkled like a jewel box,transformed for the annual Children's Hospital Benefit.Diamonds caught light from a thousand candles,champagne flowed in crystal flutes, and the wealthy elite of New York performed their yearly ritual of competitive generosity.


I moved through the crowd in a midnight blue gown,Victoria's careful training evident in every step. My hair swept up in an elegant twist, my makeup flawless,my smile measured and controlled. Camille Kane,heiress to a fortune, daughter of power. A woman these people now courted rather than dismissed.


How different from the last charity gala I'd attended as Camille Lewis. Then, I'd stood in Rose's shadow,wearing a dress she'd "allowed" me to borrow,watching society ladies air-kiss her cheeks while barely glancing my way.


"Ms. Kane." The hospital director approached,practically glowing with anticipation. "Your mother's donation will fund our new pediatric wing. We're beyond grateful."



I nodded, accepting her gratitude with the perfect blend of humility and confidence Victoria had taught me."Kane Industries believes in investing in the future.These children deserve our best efforts."



"Absolutely! Would you say a few words during the presentation? Having the Kane heir speak would mean so much."



"Of course." I scanned the room, noting potential business connections, rivals, useful allies. Victoria's voice whispering in my head: Always map the battlefield before engaging.


Then I saw them.


Stefan and Rose stood near the bar, him uncomfortable in his tuxedo, her resplendent in red silk that probably cost more than most people's monthly salary. They hadn't noticed me yet,too busy arguing in fierce whispers behind plastic smiles.



The sight of them still hit like a physical blow. After everything I'd done to destroy their businesses, after the chaos l'd engineered in their lives, they still looked...intact. Together. Rose's hand still possessively gripping Stefan's arm. His head still bent attentively toward her.


 
Something ugly twisted in my chest. Not jealousy, I'd moved beyond wanting Stefan back. Something darker. More primitive. The need to see them truly suffer. To watch them crumble completely.


My opportunity arrived sooner than expected.


"Ms. Kane!" Rose's voice, pitched to carry just the right distance. "What a pleasure to see you again!"


I turned slowly, slipping on the mask of polite interest I'd perfected for such moments. "Ms. Lewis. Mr.Rodriguez. Good evening."



They moved toward me with the desperate eagerness of drowning people spotting a lifeboat. Rose's smile too bright, Stefan's handshake too firm.


"We've been hoping to run into you," Rose gushed,positioning herself closer than social etiquette allowed."Your charity work is so inspiring."


"Thank you." I sipped my champagne, letting silence stretch uncomfortably. Victoria's first lesson in power dynamics: Make them work for your attention.


Stefan cleared his throat. "Ms. Kane, I wanted to apologize if I seemed distracted when we met at the gallery opening. Business concerns, you understand."


"Of course." I studied him with cool detachment. "I've heard Rodriguez Shipping is facing... challenges."

His face tightened."Temporary setbacks. Nothing we can't overcome with the right partnerships."



Rose jumped in smoothly. "Which is actually something we hoped to discuss. Your mother mentioned Kane Industries might be looking for shipping partners in the Asian markets?"


Their desperation was palpable, hanging in the air between us like cheap perfume. It took everything l had not to smile at the beautiful irony. Here they stood, begging for help from the very woman they'd destroyed, seeking salvation from the architect of their downfall.


"Kane Industries is always exploring new opportunities,"I replied, noncommittal. "Though we have very strict criteria for potential partners."



"Rodriguez Shipping has an impeccable reputation,"Stefan insisted, leaning forward, eyes intense. The same eyes that had once looked into mine with false promises of forever."Three generations of excellence."


"Three generations," I mused. "Such a shame to see that legacy threatened."


He flinched as if I'd struck him. "The company will recover. With the right support."


"And your fashion line, Ms. Lewis?" I turned to Rose. "I understand you're also seeking investors?"


Her perfect smile faltered slightly. "Word travels fast in New York. Yes, we're in expansion talks with several interested parties."



"How interesting;" I took another sip of champagne."Given the recent quality issues reported in fashion blogs."


"Malicious rumors." Her voice hardened even as her smile remained fixed. "Competitors trying to damage my brand's reputation."


"Competitors can be so... ruthless." I let my gaze drift over her shoulder, dismissive. "The business world is unforgiving that way."


Rose's hand tightened on Stefan's arm, her knuckles whitening. "Ms. Kane, perhaps we could meet privately?Discuss how Kane Industries and our businesses might benefit each other?"



The sheer audacity nearly made me laugh. After everythingthey'd done to me, they expected me to help them? To save them?



"I'm afraid my schedule is quite full," I said, my tone cooling several degrees. "But you're welcome to submit proposals through our investment division."



"We've tried." Stefan's composure slipped, revealing the desperation beneath. "Your people won't return our calls. If you could just put in a word..."


"A word?" I raised an eyebrow. "From me?"



"Your influence with Victoria Kane is well-known,"Rose pressed, stepping closer. The scent of her perfume, the same one she'd worn when comforting me after Stefan became distance during our marriage,made my stomach turn. "Just a small recommendation.An introduction."



I studied them both, savoring the moment. The great Rose Lewis and Stefan Rodriguez, reduced to begging for scraps of attention. For a moment, I allowed myself to imagine telling them everything. Removing my careful mask and watching recognition dawn in their eyes. Seeing them understand exactly who held their fate in her hands.



But the time wasn't right. The game wasn't finished.


"I'll consider it," I said finally. "Though I should warn you,my mother values loyalty above all else. She has little patience for those who... discard their commitments when convenient."



Stefan's face paled slightly. Did he hear the accusation beneath my words? Did some part of him sense who was really standing before him?


"We understand," Rose said quickly. "Loyalty is everything to us as well. Family values are the foundation of both our businesses."


The hypocrisy burned like acid. Family values? From the woman who had systematically destroyed her sister's life? Who had likely arranged her "accident"when convenient?



"How fortunate for you both." I glanced past them,signaling the conversation's end. "If you'll excuse me,the hospital director is waiting."



"Of course." Rose reached for my hand, squeezing it with false warmth. "Thank you for considering our request. It means everything to us."



I allowed the contact, though every cell in my body screamed to pull away. "I'm sure it does."


As I moved through the crowd, their eyes followed me.I felt their desperate hope, their growing fear.I had become what they never expected, someone with power over them. Someone who could save or destroy their carefully built world with a single word.


Victoria waited near the stage, regal in black Chanel."Productive conversation?" she asked, having observed the entire exchange.


"Very." I accepted another glass of champagne from a passing waiter. "They're desperate. The Asian shipping routes collapse hit them harder than we anticipated."


"Good." Satisfaction glinted in Victoria's eyes.your fashion line attack?"


"Rose is panicking. Trying to hide it, but she's losing clients. The quality control rumors we spread are gaining traction."


"Excellent." Victoria's smile held all the warmth of a predator spotting prey. "And your... personal reaction?"


The question caught me off guard. Victoria rarely concerned herself with emotions, focusing instead on strategy and results.


"They don't recognize me," I said carefully. "Even up close. Even with time to study my face."


"Of course they don't. Dr. Torres' work was impeccable." Victoria watched me closely. "But that wasn't what I asked."


I met her gaze directly. "It felt... powerful. Seeing them beg for help from the woman they tried to destroy."


She nodded, apparently satisfied. "Remember that feeling. It's why we're doing this. Why all the preparation matters."


But as I followed her toward the stage for the evening's presentations, I wondered if power alone was what I'd felt. Beneath the satisfaction,something else lurked. Something that had stirred when Stefan's eyes met mine, searching for help I would never give.


Not regret, exactly. Not compassion. But a shadow of the woman I'd once been. The woman who had loved without reservation. Who had believed in second chances.


That woman was gone, I reminded myself.Transformed by betrayal and Victoia's careful guidance into someone stronger. Someone who would never again be victim to their manipulations.



As I took the podium to speak about Kane Industries ' commitment to helping children, I spotted them watching from the crowd. Rose's calculating gaze.Stefan's desperate hope.


Neither of them would sleep well tonight,wondering if Camille Kane would throw them a lifeline or let them drown.



The thought brought a genuine smile to my face as l began my speech.
###Chapter 44



Camille's point of view


The private investigation office smelled of coffee and secrets. I sat across from Martin Wells, retired NYPD detective turned high-end investigator, watching him spread photos across his desk like playing cards.


"Four affairs during her timne in London," he said,tapping a grainy image of Rose entering a hotel with a man who wasn't Stefan. "Two with married executives. One with a British lord. One with her fashion mentor's husband."



Something cold settled in my stomach as I picked up the photo. Rose, laughing, hand tucked possessively into the arm of a silver-haired man twenty years her senior. The timestamp showed a date just three weeks after I'd married Stefan.



"You're certain these are authentic?" I kept my voice steady,professional. Victoria had taught me never to show emotion during business dealings, even when the business was revenge.


Wells nodded, sliding more photos toward me."Verified by three different sources. Ms Lewis was...busy during her fashion apprenticeship."


"And these men? They'll confirm the relationships if approached?"


"Two already have." Wells handed me a flash drive."Recordedstatements. Nothing explicitly naming her,but enough detail to make identification obvious.The British lord refused comment, but his ex-wife was quite forthcoming about why their marriage ended."


I studied another photo, Rose leaving a London apartment at dawn, still wearing evening clothes from the night before. The man in the doorway behind her was recognizable as Jonathan Hayes, whose wife had owned the fashion house where Rose worked.



"Mrs. Hayes fired her a week after this was taken,"Wells commented. "Publicly claimed it was due to 'creative differences.' Privately told friends it was for sleeping with her husband."


The revelation shouldn't have surprised me. Rose had always taken what she wanted, regardless of who got hurt. Yet seeing actual evidence of her betrayals while I had remained loyal to Stefan sent a wave of disgust through me.


"What about these rumors regarding missing designs?"I pushed another file toward him.Wells grimaced. "Harder to prove, but multiple sources confirm Rose 'borrowed' design concepts from other apprentices. Three designs she claimed as her own match sketches that mysteriously disappeared from colleagues' workstations."



The pattern was so familiar it made my chest ache.Rose had been doing this her entire life, stealing others' work, others' relationships, others' chances.Only now did I see how systematic it had been.



"And her time after London? The gap year before she returned to New York?"



Wells hesitated, shifting uncomfortably. "That's where things get... complicated. She claimed to be studying in Paris, but we can only place her there for three months. After that, she surfaces in Monaco."



He slid across several photos that made my breath catch. Rose, barely recognizable with platinum blonde hair,hanging on the arm of an older man whose face had been splashed across enough tabloids to be instantly familiar.


"Anton Bessonov. Russian businessman	with questionable connections. Under investigation in three countries for money laundering."


I stared at my sister's face in the photo. The calculating look in her eyes. The practiced smile. The careful positioning to ensure her best angle was captured.



"How long?"


"Six months. She lived on his yacht. Traveled with him to seven countries. Then disappeared from his life just as news of the international investigation broke."


Another photo showed Rose back in Paris, hair returned to its natural color, shopping at exclusive boutiques. The timestamp indicated just two weeks before she'd returned to New York, before she'd reconnected with Stefan.



Before my life had begun unraveling.


"Financial records?" | asked, my mouth dry.


Wells nodded, pulling out bank statements."Substantial deposits during the Bessonov period.Moved through three different shell companies before landing in her main account.Classic laundering pattern."


I sat back, letting this new information settle. Rose,my perfect, polished sister, had been a kept woman for a suspected criminal. Had potentially helped launder money. Had certainly been unfaithful to Stefan before they'd even officially begun their relationship.



"We've compiled everything into a comprehensive dossier." Wells handed me a thick envelope. "Photos,statements, financial records, timeline. Everything verified by multiple sources."



I nodded,clutching the envelope that held my sister's secret life. "The second payment will be transferred today. Thank you for your discretion."


"Ms. Kane." Wells hesitated as I stood to leave."Forgive me for asking, but why dig into Rose Lewis's past? What does Kane Industries gain from this information?"



For a moment, I considered telling him the truth. That I wasn't just Camille Kane, Victoria's heir. That the woman in those photos had stolen my husband,possibly arranged my "death," certainly destroyed my life.



Instead, I gave him the practiced smile I'd perfected over the past year. "Due diligence, Mr. Wells. We investigate all potential business partners thoroughly."



Outside in my waiting car, I finally allowed myself to process what I'd learned. The envelope sat heavy on my lap,filled with evidence of Rose's true nature. All those years I'd believed myself lacking compared to her. All those times I'd wondered why people chose her,preferred her, loved her more.



Now I understood. Rose hadn't been better, she'd simply been willing to do things I never would. Lie.Cheat. Steal. Betray. Sleep her way to opportunity.


My phone buzzed-Victoria checking on my progress.


*Evidence collected?* Her message was typically direct.




*Yes. More than expected.* I replied,fingers hovering over the keys before adding: *She's worse than we thought.*


Victoria's response came immediately: *Perfect.Phase two begins tomorrow. Release the first photo to that fashion blogger who hates her.*



I stared at the message, something uncomfortable stirring beneath my satisfaction. This was what l wanted, wasn't it? To expose Rose's lies? To destroy her reputation just as she'd destroyed mine?


Yet part of me wondered what it said about me that l was now using the same tactics Rose had always employed. Manipulation. Secrets. Revenge.



Was I becoming just like her in my quest to destroy her?



The car stopped at a red light, and I caught my reflection in the window. The face looking back was still strange to me sometimes, sharper cheekbones,more defined jawline, eyes harder than they'd once been. Victoria's creation. The perfect instrument of revenge.


But whose revenge,really? Hers or mine? And when it was over, who would I be?



The light changed, and the car moved forward,leaving these questions unanswered. I opened the envelope again, spreading the photos across my lap. Rose's secret life. Rose's hidden scandals. Rose's true nature captured in glossy 8x10s.


By this time tomorrow, the first domino would fall.The perfect image she'd constructed would begin to crack. The world would start to see what I'd always suspected beneath her polished exterior.


I should have felt only satisfaction. Instead, a strange mix of emotions churned inside me, vindication, yes,but also sadness for the sister I'd once thought I had.The family I'd believed in. The love I'd trusted.



All lies.



My phone buzzed again, not Victoria this time, but Alexander.



*Hunting tonight?* His message asked, our code for discussing my revenge plans.


I hesitated before replying: *Found the prey's weakness. Preparing the first strike.*
His response made me pause: *Remember who you are beneath the hunter's clothes.*



Who was I beneath this new identity? Beneath the surgical alterations, the designer clothes, the careful training? Was anything left of the woman who had loved so openly, trusted so completely?


I gathered the photos, returning them to the envelope.Tomorrow they would become weapons in my war against Rose. Tonight, they were just reminders of how thoroughly I'd been deceived.



By my sister. By my husband. By my parents.



The car turned onto the private road leading to Victoria's estate. Through the trees, lights glowed welcome in the gathering dusk. My new home. My new life.



I touched the phoenix pendant at my throat, Victoria's gift symbolizing rebirth through fire.



"Hunting tonight?" James asked as he opened my car door, using Alexander's phrase with different meaning.


I nodded, clutching the envelope of secrets. "Yes. And tomorrow, the hunt goes public."



As I walked toward the house, I felt the weight of my choices pressing down. The evidence I'd gathered would destroy Rose piece by piece, just as she'd done to me. Would expose her lies just as she'd exposed my vulnerabilities.



It was justice, I told myself. Not revenge. Justice for years of manipulation. For stolen opportunities. For a life taken without remorse.



So why did victory already taste like ashes in my mouth?



Because deep down, beneath Victoria's careful programming, beneath the hunger for revenge,a small voice whispered an uncomfortable truth: in destroying Rose this way, I was becoming what I hated most about her.



I pushed the thought away, squaring my shoulders as I entered the house. Tomorrow would bring the first public blow against Rose's carefully constructed image. The first crack in her perfect life.



And nothing, not even my own doubts, would stop what I'd set in motion.

###Chapter 45



Camille's point of view



Five screens glowed on the wall of Victoria's private office,each displaying a different fashion blog. The headline on Fashion Insider screamed in bold type: "ROSE LEWIS: FASHION'S FEMME FATALE?"Below it, a grainy but unmistakable photo showed Rose entering a London hotel with Jonathan Hayes,her mentor's husband.



Victoria and I sat side by side at her conference table,watching the story unfold in real time. The digital clock on her desk showed 9:07 AM. The story had been live for exactly twelve minutes, and already the view counter showed over three thousand clicks.



"Perfectly timed," Victoria said,satisfaction evident in her voice. "The fashion industry wakes up, checks their morning feeds, and finds their darling exposed."



I nodded, a strange mix of emotions washing through me. Satisfaction, yes. The first real blow against Rose's carefully constructed image. But something else too, something | hadn't expected. A hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach. Was this really victory? Releasing photos that had been easy to obtain, evidence of sins that seemed almost trivial compared to what she'd done to me?



"Ms. Kane? Ms. Camille?" My assistant Rebecca knocked before entering, tablet in hand, excitement barely contained. "You wanted updates on the Rose Lewis situation?”



Victoria motioned her forward. "Report."



"The story's spreading faster than projected. It's hit three major fashion blogs in the last five minutes.Social media engagement is exploding." Rebecca handed Victoria the tablet. "Her publicist has already issued two different denial statements, each one contradicting the last."



Victoria's lips curved into a rare smile as she scrolled through the data. "And the hashtag we planted?"



"#RoseThorns is trending in New York and Los Angeles." Rebecca couldn't hide her admiration. "The influencers we prepped are amplifying exactly as planned."



I leaned forward, scanning the social media metrics on the tablet. "Her brand partners?"


"Panicking." Rebecca's smile widened. "Three have already reached out to their legal teams about morality clauses in their contracts."


Victoria handed me the tablet, our eyes meeting briefly. This moment, the first real strike against Rose,was what we'd been building toward for months.



"I want to see her," I said suddenly. "When she gets the news."



Victoria raised an eyebrow. "Dangerous. Unnecessary."



"I'll stay hidden. I just..." I struggled to explain the hunger inside me. "I need to see her face."



Understanding dawned in Victoria's eyes. "Not enough to destroy her. You need to witness it."


"Yes."



She considered for a moment, then nodded."Rebecca,have James position Ms. Kane near the Lewis boutique.The target has an investor meeting there at ten."



***********



Thirty minutes later, I sat in a darkened car across from Rose's flagship store in the Fashion District. Tinted windows ensured no one could see me, but I had a perfect view of the boutique's glass front.


Rose arrivedat 9:50, looking immaculate in a white pantsuit that probably cost more than most people's monthly rent. Her smile for the waiting paparazzi showed no sign that her world was beginning to unravel.



Then I saw it. The moment her assistant rushed out,phone extended urgently. The slight freeze in Rose's perfect posture..The fractional widening of her eyes as she looked at the screen.



Even from this distance,I could read the shock in her body language. The momentary loss of control as her practiced mask slipped.


The waiting photographers noticed too, cameras suddenly firing rapidly, capturing her unguarded reaction. Her hand clutched her assistant's arm for balance. Her mouth opened slightly before snapping shut.



For ten glorious seconds, I watched genuine panic overtake my sister's face. Then, like the performer she'd always been, she recovered. Smiled tightly.Waved off the photographers. Walked into her boutique with practiced grace.



But I'd seen it. That moment of pure, unfiltered fear.That instant where her carefully constructed world began to crumble.


It tasted like honey on my tongue.


Back at Kane Industries, Victoria and I tracked the story's spread through more mainstream media. By noon,three major fashion magazines had picked it up.By two,entertainment news sites were running special features on "Fashion's Own Scandal." By four, Rose's Instagram comments had become so toxic she'd disabled them.



"Initial estimates show a twelve percent drop in her online sales today," Victoria noted, reviewing the latest analytics. "Two minor influencers have already canceled promotional posts with her brand."



I nodded,scanning the reports. "And the investors?"



"Postponed their meeting. Waiting to see how bad the damage gets."





Victory. Clear and undeniable. The first true strike in my campaign against Rose.





So why did part of me still feel empty?



I dismissed the feeling, focusing instead on the next phase. "When do we release the Russian connection?"


Victoria consulted her watch. "Three days. Let this first scandal fully develop before introducing the next.Maximum damage occurs when people are just beginning to recover from one blow before receiving another."



Her cold precision should have bothered me.Once,it would have. Now I found comfort in her tactical approach,her emotional detachment.It made my own conflicted feelings easier to ignore.



My phone buzzed with a text message.I glanced down,expecting another update from our media team.



Instead, Alexander Pierce's name lit up my screen:*Watching your sister's meltdown on Page Six live updates. Remind me never to cross you, little phoenix.Though I must say, hotel security footage seems beneath your creative talents. Looking forward to what you do next.-A*



Heat crept up my neck as I quickly darkened the phone screen. How had he known? We'd been so careful, ensuring no connection between Kane Industries and the leaked photos.



Victoria's sharp eyes missed nothing. "Problem?"


"No," I replied, too quickly. "Just a market update."


Her gaze lingered a moment too long, assessing,calculating, before she returned to the reports."Tomorrow we'll monitor the fallout and prepare for phase two. The British lord's ex-wife has provided some...exceptionally detailed revelations."


I nodded, trying to focus on Victoria's words while my mind kept returning to Alexander's message. Little phoenix. The nickname no one else used.The teasing tone that somehow acknowledged both my strength and my vulnerability.


And the unsettling realization that he knew what I was doing.



Later, alone in my suite, I stared at his message again.Should I respond? Ignore it? Report this development to Victoria?



My finger hovered over the delete button. Alexander Pierce was dangerous, too perceptive, too knowledgeable, too interested in my affairs. Victoria would see him as a threat to our plans.



But something in his teasing words resonated with the emptiness I'd felt even as I'd watched Rose's world begin to crumble.



Without quite deciding to, I typed a response:*Quality improves with the next release. Though I'm curious how you identified my handiwork.*


His reply came almost instantly: *The same way I know when a master painter has created a new work. The technique is unmistakable, even with different brushes.Sleep well,avenger. Tomorrow brings new battles.*


I turned off my phone, moving to the window that overlooked Victoria's immaculate gardens. Tomorrow would bring more scandal for Rose, more destruction of her carefully built world.
But tonight, for the first time since beginning this path of revenge, I found myself wondering if victory was supposed to feel this empty. If becoming like those who had hurt me was truly the justice I sought.



I touched the phoenix pendant at my throat, Victoria's symbol of rebirth through fire.


What kind of person was I becoming in these flames?
And would I recognize myself when the transformation was complete?
###Chapter 46



Rose point of view



I stared at my phone screen until the words blurred,reading the same headline for the twentieth time."ROSE LEWIS: THE PRIVATE LIFE SHE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO SEE." Beneath it, that grainy photo of me entering the London hotel with Jonathan four years ago. His hand on my lower back. My face turned up to his,laughing at something he'd said.



How? How had anyone found this? I'd been so careful.



My boutique office, normally my sanctuary, felt suffocating now. Outside, I could hear my staff whispering, their usual respectful silence replaced by urgent murmurs. They'd seen the stories. Everyone had.



Three major fashion sites had dropped my spring collection.Five influencers had canceled promotional contracts. Two department stores had "postponed"their orders. All within twenty-four hours.


My empire, built so carefully brick by brick, was crumbling beneath my feet.
The phone on my desk rang again. My publicity team,no doubt, with another useless strategy. I'd already released three statements, first denying everything,then suggesting the photos were manipulated, finally admitting to "youthful indiscretions" while in London.None had stemmed the bleeding.


I ignored the call, returning to my social media feeds.The comments cut like knives.



"Always knew she was fake."

"Poor Camille, no wonder she drove into that river."

"#RoseThorns is right .... beautiful but toxic!"


Tears stung my eyes. Not from shame, I'd never felt shame for taking what I wanted, but from rage. I'd spent years crafting the perfect image. The talented designer. The grieving sister. The devoted fiancée. All destroyed by one stolen moment captured on film.



The office door banged open. Stefan stood there,still wearing his work suit, face thunderous. He held his phone in a white-knuckled grip.


"When were you going to tell me?" His voice was dangerously quiet.


I stood, smoothing my skirt, forcing my face into concerned lines. "Stefan, darling. I've been trying to reach you all day. These rumors are...."
"Not rumors." He stepped inside, slamming the door behind him. "Facts. With photographic evidence."


"It was years ago. Before us. Before...."



"Before us?" He laughed, a harsh sound I'd never heard from him. "According to the date on this photo,you were sleeping with your mentor's husband three weeks after I married your sister."


Ice slid down my spine. I hadn't noticed the timestamp.Hadn't thought anyone would look that closely.


"It wasn't serious," I tried, moving toward him. "A mistake. One night that meant nothing."


He stepped back, avoiding my touch."And the others?Lord Hartley? Anton Bessonov?"


My stomach dropped. They knew about Anton too?How much had they uncovered?


"Who's feeding you these lies?" I demanded, offense as defense. "Who's trying to destroy what we have?"



"What we have." Stefan ran a hand through his hair,disheveled in a way that would normally make me want to fix it. "What exactly do we have, Rose? A relationship built on our manipulation of Camille? A future founded on lies?"
"I never lied to you," I insisted. "I just didn't share every detail of my past. Everyone has secrets."


"Secrets." He stared at me like he'd never seen me before. "Like where you really were during your 'year in Paris'? Because according to these new photos,you spent six months on a Russian oligarch's yacht."


More photos. More evidence. My mind raced,calculating damage, planning counterattacks. Who was doing this? Who had the resources and motivation to dig so deeply into my past?


"It's not what it looks like," I said, falling back on the most basic denial.


"It never is with you, is it?" Stefan's voice had gone flat. "Nothing's ever what it looks like. Not your relationship with me while I was married to Camille.Not your convenient return from London just when our marriage was struggling. Not your sudden devotion after her accident."



"How dare you," I hissed, genuine anger flaring."I loved Camille. Her death destroyed me!"



"Did it?" He moved closer, eyes searching mine."Because I keep remembering your face that night.When they told us her car went off that bridge. You didn't look surprised, Rose. You looked... relieved."
My heart stuttered. Had he noticed? Had he seen through my performance even then?


"That's absurd. Grief affects people differently.You know that."



"What I know," Stefan said slowly, "is that I'm beginning to wonder if I ever knew you at all."


The door opened again before I could respond. This time my parents stood in the threshold, my mother's eyes red-rimmed, my father's face grim.


"Rose." My father's voice, usually so warm when addressing me, had gone cold. "We need to talk."


Four people in my small office now, the walls closing in. I'd faced criticism before, weathered minor scandals, but never this coordinated attack from all sides.



"Not now," I said, desperation leaking into my voice."I'm dealing with a PR crisis, as you can see."



"A PR crisis?" My mother stepped forward,brandishing her phone. "Is that what you call sleeping with a married man while you were studying? Is that what you call lying about where you were during your 'fashion internship'?"
even the worst part. The worst part is that while I was being cold to Camille, having love for you and waiting for you to come back, you were busy messing around with these men."



The raw pain in his voice shocked me. The betrayal in his eyes cut deeper than my parents' disappointment.He truly had been waiting for me, just as I'd planned.But now he knew I hadn't been doing the same.


"Stefan,please..."



"All those times I was distant with Camille, all those nights I stayed late at the office thinking about you,missing you... and you were on some Russian's yacht?In some lord's bed?" His voice broke slightly. "You made me the worst husband imaginable to your sister while you were just...having fun?"


The betrayal cut deep from all sides. My mother had always been my strongest advocate, always taken my side against Camille, against anyone who challenged me. And Stefan had been my sure thing, my fallback plan,the man who would always want me.


"Mom,please. These photos are being taken out of context."



"Context?" She scrolled through her phone, each swipe revealing another damning image. Me with Jonathan at a private dinner. Me with Lord Hartley at his country estate. Me boarding Anton's yacht in Monaco. "What possible context makes this acceptable?"


"I made choices to advance my career," I said, drawing myself up. "Choices men make every day without judgment."



"Men don't pretend to be working in Paris while lounging on criminal yachts," my father snapped. "Men don't sleep with their mentors' husbands while claiming to be learning design skills."



The united front stunned me. My parents had never confronted me this way, had always accepted my explanations, my tears, my carefully crafted stories.


"Who exactly do you think you are?" My mother's question sliced through my shock. "Because the daughter we thought we knew wouldn't behave this way."



"The daughter you thought you knew?" I laughed,bitterness finally boiling over. "The daughter you chose over your own blood! The daughter you let get away with everything because she was so special,so talented, so perfect!"


My voice had risen to a shout, years of resentment fueling my words. Yes, they'd chosen me, favored me,but always with conditions. Always expecting


Stefan's laugh was sharp, almost cruel. "That's not performance. Perfection. Success.



"We gave you everything," my father said, voice shaking. "Opportunities Camille never had. Support she never received. And this is how you honor that?By destroying your own reputation? By embarrassing this family?"


"My reputation?" I grabbed a vase from my desk,hurling it against the wall. Water and flowers sprayed across my design sketches, ruining weeks of work."My entire career is being dismantled by these stories, and you're worried about family embarrassment?"


Stefan moved between me and my parents, hands raised as if calming a wild animal. "Rose, you need to pull yourself together. This isn't helping."


"Helping?" I seized a design award from my shelf,feeling its weight in my hand. "Nothing is helping! My business partners are abandoning me. My wedding plans are shelved. My own fiancé is questioning my character!"



The award smashed against my computer screen,cracks spiderwebbing across the display. The release felt so good I grabbed another object, a framed photo of me and Stefan, and sent it flying.



"Stop it!" My mother tried to restrain me, but I pushed her away, sending her stumbling into my father. "Don't touch me! None of you understand what I've built, what l've sacrificed, what I've done to get here!"


"What exactly have you done, Rose?" Stefan's quiet question froze me mid-destruction. "What sacrifices are you talking about?"


His eyes held something new, not just anger or betrayal, but suspicion. Sharp and focused.. As if pieces were finally clicking into place.


"Nothing," I backtracked quickly. "Business sacrifices.Career choices."



"No." He stepped closer, voice dropping. "I think there's more. Something about Camile. Something you're still hiding."


For a terrifying moment, I thought he knew. About the men I'd hired to frighten Camille that night. About how things had gone wrong. About the car plunging into the river instead of just delivering a warning.


"You're being paranoid," I whispered, suddenly aware I'd said too much.



"Am l?" He held my gaze, searching. "First these photos prove you were seeing me behind her back while we were married. Now your extreme reaction to simple questions. What exactly happened the night of her accident, Rose?" "Nothing! I wasn't even there!" The words burst out too quickly, too defensively.


My father stepped forward. "What do you mean,you weren't there? You told us you were having dinner with her that night. That she canceled at the last minute."



More mistakes. More cracks in my story. I needed control, needed to regain my footing in this rapidly deteriorating situation.


"I misspoke," I said, forcing calm I didn't feel. "This stress is making me confused. Of course I was supposed to meet her. She canceled. You know this."


But Stefan was watching me with that same evaluating look, that same growing suspicion. "Your stories never quite added up about that night. And now all these other lies coming to light..."


"Get out." The words tore from my throat."All of you,get out of my office."


"Rose...." my mother began.


"OUT!" I screamed, grabbing another object, a glass paperweight and hurling it at the wall above their heads.



They retreated, Stefan shepherding my parents through the door, his final glance at me filled with something that looked like pity mixed with growing certainty.


When they were gone, I collapsed into my chair,surrounded by the destruction I'd caused. Glass and water and flowers littered the floor. My computer screen flickered with spiderweb cracks. Design sketches lay ruined on my once-pristine desk.


My phone buzzed with another notification. Another story breaking. Another piece of my past exposed for public consumption.



Who was doing this? Who had both the resources to uncover my secrets and the motivation to destroy me so methodically?
###Chapter 47



Camille's point of view



The morning sun cast long shadows across my desk as I reviewed the latest reports on Rodriguez Shipping's supply chain. Five of their key suppliers had abruptly terminated contracts in the past twenty-four hours.Two more were scheduled to announce their withdrawal by noon. Each one citing "business concerns" or "strategic realignment" - corporate speak for abandoning a sinking ship.



What none of them mentioned was the quiet pressure from Kane Industries. The subtle threats about future business relationships. The anonymous tips about Rodriguez financial instability. The carefully orchestrated market manipulation that made partnering with Stefan's company look increasingly dangerous.



"Ms. Kane." My assistant Rebecca knocked before entering, tablet in hand. "Marunouchi Trading just announced their withdrawal. Their statement hit the financial press five minutes ago."



I nodded, satisfaction warming my blood. Marunouchi was Stefan's largest Asian supplier, accounting for nearly thirty percent of his Pacific shipping materials.



"How did the market react?"



"Rodriguez stock dropped another eight points in pre -market trading." Rebecca couldn't hide her admiration. "At this rate, they'll be below their IPO price by next week."



"And Stefan?"



"Scheduled an emergency board meeting for tomorrow morning. His father is flying back from Europe tonight." Rebecca's efficiency reflected the months of training Victoria had invested in all staff who worked directly with me.



Good. Let him feel the walls closing in. Let him experience the helpless panic I'd felt when my own life crumbled beneath me.



Victoria entered as Rebecca was leaving,impeccable as always in a tailored navy suit that conveyed power without effort. Her eyes took in the market data on my screens with evident satisfaction.



"I see Marunouchi made their announcement," she said,moving to stand beside my desk. "Your strategy is working even better than projected."


She studied me, head tilted slightly. "You've done exceptional work targeting his supply chain. Where did you obtain such detailed knowledge of their dependencies?"


I kept my expression neutral. "Research. Planning.Careful analysis."



Not entirely a lie. But not the whole truth either.I didn't mention the nights I'd spent listening to Stefan talk about his company's operations. The dinners where he'd explained supply chain dynamics to me,thinking his wife too simple to truly understand. The business meetings I'd attended as "support" while absorbing every detail.



His underestimation of me then had become his vulnerability now.


"Well, your analysis was flawless." Victoria nodded with genuine approval, rare from a woman who seldom offered praise.



Rebecca knocked again, appearing in the doorway."Ms. Kane, just a reminder that the second batch of Rose's photos is schedluled to release at noon.Entertainment sites first, then fashion blogs, then mainstream news. The media team is standing by."


My finger hovered over my keyboard, the final command queued and ready. These photos would hurt Rose far more than the first batch. Not just affairs and indiscretions, but evidence of her time with Anton Bessonov. Her connections to his questionable business dealings. Her presence on his yacht during negotiations later flagged by international authorities.



One keystroke would send her professional reputation from damaged to destroyed.



I pressed enter.



"It's done," I said, a strange mix of emotions washing through me. Victory, yes. But also something darker.Something that felt uncomfortably like becoming what I hated most about my sister.


Victoria observed me with that penetrating gaze that always seemed to see beneath my carefully maintained facade. "You hesitated before pressing enter.Having doubts?"


"No," I replied, perhaps too quickly. "Just savoring the moment."



She studied me for another beat before accepting my answer with a slight nod. "I'll be in strategic planning until two. Have Rebecca update me on the public reaction as it develops."



Rebecca appeared in the doorway again, as if summoned by her name. "I'll have the media team monitor reaction and amplify key narratives,Ms.Kane." After she left, I pulled up the live feed from the security camera outside Rose's boutique. We'd installed it weeks ago, ensuring I could witness her world unraveling in real time.



It took exactly twenty-seven minutes for the news to reach her. I watched her assistant rush out to the waiting car, phone extended urgently. Saw Rose's perfect posture crumple slightly as she read the headlines. Watched color drain from her face as photographers swarmed, suddenly alert to a story breaking before their eyes.



For a brief, wonderful moment, pure panic overtook her features. Then, like the performer she'd always been, she recovered. Forced a smile. Waved off questions with practiced grace.


But I'd seen it. That flash of genuine fear. That instant recognition that her carefully constructed life was truly falling apart.



It should have felt sweeter.



My phone buzzed with a text from Alexander: *The queen takes another piece from the board.Impressive moves, little phoenix.*


How did he always know? Every strike against Rose and Stefan, every carefully orchestrated attack,somehow Alexander Pierce tracked them all, commenting with his odd mix of admiration and concern.



I pushed away the question, focusing instead on the financial terminals tracking Rodriguez Shipping's continued decline. The stock had opened another six percent down.. News alerts showed shipping customers seeking alternative partners. Industry analysts questioning the company's future viability.



My phone buzzed with a text from our source inside Rodriguez Shipping: *Complete chaos here. Stefan locked in emergency meetings all day. Board members threatening resignation. His father shouting about family legacy destroyed.*



I smiled at the update. Let him feel the walls closing in.Let him experience the helpless panic I'd felt when my own life crumbled beneath me.



On my screens, financial news channels were now covering Rodriguez Shipping's crisis as breaking news.Market analysts questioning the company's survival.Industry experts speculating about who might acquire their routes once bankruptcy became inevitable.



"Should we prepare a statement about Kane Industries 'interest in certain Rodriguez assets?" Victoria asked,watching the coverage with satisfaction. "The market would respond well to hints we might acquire their Pacific routes." "Not yet," I replied, strategic even in my revenge. "Let the value drop further before showing our hand."


On my screen, financial news channels were now covering Rodriguez Shipping's crisis as breaking news.Market analysts questioning the company's survival.Industry experts speculating about who might acquire their routes once bankruptcy became inevitable.


Rebecca returned, excitement barely contained beneath her professional demeanor. "Ms. Kane, the Rose photos are performing beyond expectations.Three major fashion houses have publicly severed ties with her brand. Her main manufacturing partner just announced they're 'reevaluating their relationship.'"


"And the Russian connection?"



"Already picked up by mainstream news." Rebecca couldn't hide her admiration for our strategy."They're asking if she helped launder money through her early designs. If her current business was built on criminal funding. By end of day, she'll be toxic to any legitimate business partner."



Victoria entered as Rebecca was delivering her report,satisfaction evident in her rare smile. She nodded approvingly at the metrics displayed on my screens.



I nodded, moving to the window overlooking Manhattan.Somewhere out there, Rose was watching her career implode. Stefan was fighting to save his family legacy. Both experiencing the same helpless panic they'd once inflicted on me.


Justice, I reminded myself. Not revenge. Justice for years of manipulation and betrayal.


So why did victory taste increasingly bitter?


"Stefan called me directly," I said, still watching the city below. "Begging for a meeting."


Victoria's reflection in the window showed her sharp interest. "And you said?"


"Next Tuesday.Fifteen minutes."


"Excellent." She moved beside me. "The perfect opportunity to witness his desperation firsthand. To watch him beg without understanding who truly holds his fate."



The thought should have thrilled me. Once, it would have. Now I felt only a strange hollowness.


"What happens when it's over?" I asked quietly."When they're both destroyed completely?"


Victoria studied me carefully. "We move forward.You take your rightful place as my heir. We build something greater than either of us could alone." But that wasn't what I'd asked. Not really. The question I couldn't quite voice was simpler: Who would I be when revenge no longer defined me?


My phone buzzed with another message from Alexander: *When the game ends and all pieces are captured, what then for the queen? Perhaps we should discuss over dinner tomorrow.*



I turned away from the window, deliberately ignoring both Victoria's questioning look and Alexander's message. On my desk, reports showed Stefan's company bleeding value by the minute. On my screens, entertainment sites splashed Rose's scandalous past for all to see.


This was what I'd wanted. What I'd planned for months.What I'd changed my entire identity to achieve.



Victory. Revenge. Justice.


Rebecca knocked before entering again. "Ms. Kane,the board is requesting your assessment of Rodriguez Shipping's	remaining	assets.	They'd	like recommendations on which pieces might be worth acquiring once the company is forced to sell."


I nodded, returning to business. To the careful,methodical destruction of those who had destroyed me. To the path I'd chosen and could no longer deviate from.
Yet as Victoria outlined our next moves against Stefan's failing company, part of me wondered if Alexander's question deserved consideration.


When the game ends and all pieces are captured,what then for the queen?
###Chapter 48



Rose point of view



The showroom that had once been my pride now felt like a tomb. Silent. Empty. Abandoned. I moved between the clothing racks, touching fabrics that represented thousands of hours of work. My spring collection, the one fashion critics had called "boundary-pushing" and "career-defining" just weeks ago,hung untouched,unsold,unwanted.



My phone buzzed for the twentieth time that morning.Another cancellation, no doubt. Another buyer pulling orders. Another door slamming shut.



I ignored it, continuing my lonely tour through what remained of my empire. The front desk sat vacant, I'd had to let Jessica go yesterday, along with three other staff members. The remaining team worked from home now, making desperate calls to salvage what business they could.



The quiet made the memories louder. The launch party for this collection just two months ago Champagne flowing. Music pulsing. Fashion editors praising my "visionary aesthetic." Buyers from luxury stores around the world competing for exclusive pieces.



All gone.


In the back office, financial reports covered my desk in a sea of red numbers. The phone rang again, my lawyer's name flashing on the screen. I answered this time,bracing for more bad news.



"Rose," Mark's voice carried the careful tone people use with the terminally ill. "Neiman Marcus just pulled their entire order."



My fingers tightened on the phone. Neiman had been my biggest supporter from the beginning. Their spring order represented nearly a million dollars in revenue.



"They can't do that," I said, struggling to keep my voice steady. "We have a contract."


"They're invoking the morality clause. Paragraph sixteen,section B. The same one Saks used yesterday."


Another blow. Another cut. I sank into my chair,legs suddenly unable to support my weight.


"What about Bergdorf?" I asked, though I already knew the answer from his silence.


 
"Their email came five minutes ago. I was about to call you." Three major department stores in twenty-four hours.Each one citing the same "reputational concerns"after the photos of me with Anton Bessonov had spread through every fashion publication.


"What about the spring production run?" I asked, mind racing to find some path forward. "We've already started manufacturing."



Mark hesitated. "That's the other thing. Stellar Fabrics called this morning. They're canceling delivery of the materials."



The room tilted sideways. Stellar was our main supplier. Without their specialized fabrics, we couldn't produce anything, not the spring collection, not even basic pieces to keep cash flowing.



"They can't back out!" My voice rose despite my efforts to remain calm. "We prepaid half the order!"



"They're refunding the deposit, but thecontract has the same morality clause as the others. Rose,someone went through your agreements very carefully. Every major partner has the same exit provision."


Ice spread through mny veins. This wasn't bad luck or coincidence. This was planned. Executed with precision by someone who wanted to destroy me completely. Who would do this, Mark? Who wants to ruin me?"



"It could be any competitor in the industry. Fashionis...."


"No," I cut him off. "This feels personal. The timing of the photo leaks. The coordination of the contract cancellations. Someone is orchestrating this."



Mark sighed. "I've reached out to my contacts at the other fashion houses. No one seems to know where the photos originated. They just appeared simultaneously on multiple blogs, like they were seeded deliberately."



My mind raced through possibilities. Jealous designers?Industry rivals? Former lovers with grudges? The list of people I'd stepped on to reach the top wasn't short.



"Has anyone unusual been asking questions about me?Anyone new in the industry who might have something against me?"


"Not that I know of. But Rose, we need to focus on saving what's left of the business. If we can secure bridge financing..."



"There won't be a business left to save if we don't identify who's attacking us!" I slammed my hand on the desk, sending financial reports fluttering to the floor. "Someone didn't just happen to find those photos. Someone went looking for them.Someone who knew exactly where to search."


As if responding to my outburst, the office door opened. My assistant Michael stood there, face pale.


"What now?" I demanded, already knowing from his expression it wasn't good.


"Vogue just pulled your feature." His voice trembled slightly. "And Harper's Bazaar is asking for comment about... about the Russian money laundering allegations."



The room spun around me. The Vogue feature had been scheduled for months, a six-page spread celebrating my "authentic creative vision." Now gone.And money laundering? The accusation felt like a physical blow.


"What allegations?" Mark asked sharply.



Michael handed me his tablet. On screen, a financial blog I'd never heard of detailed suspicious transactions between Anton Bessonov's accounts and my early business funding. Transactions I'd thought were buried, hidden,forgotten.



"This is insane," I whispered, scanning the article."These records were private. How did anyone get access?"

 But I already knew the answer. Someone with resources. Someone with connections. Someone determined to ruin me.


The landline phone rang... the private line that only went to certain clients and partners. I placed it on speaker, trying to gather my composure.



"Rose Lewis."



"Ms. Lewis, this is Maria Chen from Women's Wear Daily. We're running a story about your brand's financial situation and wanted to offer you a chance to comment."



My heart stuttered. WWD was fashion's bible. Their coverage reached every corner of the industry.


"What exactly is your story about?" | asked, fighting to keep my voice professional.


"We've received information that several major retailers have canceled orders amid concerns about your past business associations. Sources also indicate Stellar Fabrics has terminated your supply contract,and your main manufacturing partner is suspending production."



Every disaster I'd learned about this morning, wrapped into one neat package. How had they gotten this information so quickly?
"We're also including details about the Russian yacht photos and alleged financial irregularities," Maria continued. "Is there a statement you'd like to make?"


Mark made frantic cutting motions across his throat.Don't comment.Don't engage. Don't make it worse.


"This is a targeted campaign to destroy my reputation and business," I said, ignoring his warning."Someone is deliberately spreading lies and manipulating contexts to damage my brand. I categorically deny any wrongdoing."



"So you're saying the photos with Anton Bessonov are fake?"



The trap was obvious, but my anger overwhelmed my caution. "The photos are real. The relationship was not what's being implied. And my business dealings have alwvays been legitimate."



"Then how do you explain the three million dollars transferred from offshore accounts into your initial business funding?"


The specific amount sent ice through my veins. That number wasn't public. Wasn't even in my official records. Only two people knew that exact figure, me and Anton.



"| have no further comment," I said, ending the call before I could say something worse.


"Rose," Mark said quietly. "What offshore accounts?"



I shook my head, unwilling to answer even my lawyer.Some secrets had to remain buried,especially now.


Michael hovered uncertainly by the door. "There's one more thing. The factory in Milan called. They need to speak with you urgently."


Our main production facility. The backbone of the entire operation. If they pulled out too...


"Give me five minutes," I said, needing a moment alone before facing the next disaster.


When they left, I moved to the window overlooking the Fashion District. Just last year, I'd chosen this office specifically for this view, a constant reminder of the industry I was conquering. Now it felt like looking at a kingdom that had rejected me.



My phone buzzed with a text from Stefan: *Are you seeing the news? We need to talk. Someone is coming after both of us.*



So he'd made the connection too. Whatever was happening,we were both targets of the same enemy.


The question was,who? And why? A notification appeared on my computer screen. An email from my bank. Subject line: URGENT ACCOUNT FREEZE.



My hands shook as I opened it. The message was brief but devastating. Due to "ongoing financial investigations," all business accounts associated with my name were temporarily frozen. Effective immediately.



No access to operating funds. No way to pay remaining staff. No ability to settle debts with the few suppliers still willing to work with me.



Complete financial paralysis.



| dialed Stefan immediately. "They've frozen my accounts," I said without greeting. "All of them."


"Mine too," he replied, sounding as shaken as | felt."Ten minutes ago. Right after I lost my last two major Asian shipping partners."



"This isn't coincidence."



"No," he agreed. "Someone's targeting us both systematically. The question is who has the power and motivation to do this."



"Who would hate both of us this much?" | whispered,genuine fear replacing anger for the first time.

 "I don't know. But whoever it is, they're not stopping until we're completely destroyed."



After he hung up, I stood alone in my silent showroom.Beautiful clothes that no one would buy. A business account with no money. A reputation in tatters.


Everything I'd built, everything I'd schemed for,everything I'd sacrificed for, gone in a matter of days.


The door opened again. Michael entered looking like he might vomit. "The factory in Milan has terminated our contract. And Women's WVear Daily just published their article. It's... it's bad, Rose."


I took the tablet he offered, scanning the headline: "ROSE LEWIS EMPIRE COLLAPSES AMID SCANDAL AND FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES."



The article was comprehensive, devastating, and filled with details no one should have known. Every financial vulnerability. Every contract termination.Every skeleton I'd thought safely buried.



As I reached the end, something caught my eye that made my blood freeze.



"..industry insiders note the curious timing that both Lewis and her fiancé Stefan Rodriguez are facing simultaneous business collapses, leading to speculation about possible connected financial improprieties."



They were linking us together, suggesting our separate disasters were somehow connected to shared wrongdoing. Making us both toxic in their respective industries.



I sank to my knees among the beautiful clothes no one would ever wear, surrounded by the dreams that were turning to dust before my eyes.


Whoever was doing this had resources I couldn't fight,connections | couldn't match, and a determination l couldn't overcome. They weren't just attacking my business, they were systematically erasing everything I'd built.



As I knelt there, a strange calm replaced my panic. I'd fought my way out of nothing once before. Clawed my way up from the foster system. Reinvented myself as the perfect daughter, the talented designer, the success story.



I could do it again.



I would do it again.


But first, I needed to find out who hated both me and Stefan enough to orchestrate our complete destruction.



Because this wasn't just business. This was personal.
And I would make them pay.
###Chapter 49



The view from the seventy-eighth floor of Pierce Tower turned Manhattan into a miniature city, tiny lights flickering like stars below. Alexander stood at the floor-to-ceiling window,phone pressed to his ear,watching darkness spread across the skyline. His reflection stared back at him, perfectly tailored suit,carefully neutral expression, eyes that revealed nothing of the game he was playing.



"I understand your interest in Rose Lewis's fashion line,Mr. Hiroshi," he said, voice smooth as aged whiskey."But my analysis suggests it would be an unwise investment at this time. The brand carries significant hidden liabilities."



The Japanese investor on the other end sounded disappointed. "Our research indicated solid growth potential despite recent... difficulties."


"Your research is incomplete," Alexander replied,moving to his desk where three monitors displayed financial data on Rose's collapsing business. "I've taken the liberty of sending you some additional information. Check your secure email." He'd spent hours compiling this dossier - rumors of design theft, details of canceled retail contracts, hints of connections to Bessonov's questionable finances.All true, all damaging, all impossible to ignore for a cautious investor like Hiroshi.


"This is... most concerning," Hiroshi said after a lengthy pause. "You've saved me from a significant mistake, Mr. Pierce. I owe you a debt of gratitude."


"Not at all. That's what friends do." Alexander kept his voice warm, collegial. "There will be better opportunities. Perhaps we could discuss the tech portfolio I mentioned last month?"


After finalizing plans to redirect Hiroshi's investment toward one of his own companies, Alexander ended the call and checked his list. Rose Lewis had approached nine potential investors since her business began collapsing. He'd now intercepted and turned away seven of them.


The phone rang again, his private line. Only three people had this number.


"Sarah. Updates?"



His secretary's efficient voice filled the room."Rodriguez Shipping approached Eastern Capital Partners this morning. They're seeking hundred million in emergency financing." Alexander frowned slightly. Eastern Capital was one of the few major investment firms he didn't have direct influence over.



"Who's handling their case?"



"David Chen."



Alexander smiled. David owed him a favor from last year's Hong Kong deal. "Connect me to him. And have the team prepare a detailed risk assessment on Rodriguez Shipping. Make sure it emphasizes their Asian routes collapse and management instability."



"Already done, sir. The assessment is being delivered to Mr. Chen's office as we speak."


"Excellent." Alexander paused. "Any news from Kane Industries?"



"Ms. Kane is scheduled to appear at the Metropolitan Museum fundraiser tonight. Our sources indicate she'll be alone, Victoria is in Chicago for a separate engagement."



Interesting. Camille attending a major event without Victoria's watchful presence. An opportunity, perhaps.



"Send flowers to her office. White roses. No card."



"Yes,sir.Anything else?" Alexander moved back to the window, mind already calculating next moves. "Have we received the updated assessment on Sterling Financial's exposure to Rodriguez Shipping debt?"


"Yes, sir. They're significantly overextended. If Rodriguez defaults on their existing loans, Sterling could face a liquidity crisis."


"Perfect. Leak that information to the Wall Street Journal's financial desk. Anonymously,of course."


When Sarah signed off, Alexander remained at the window,watching night fully claim the city. In the distance, the lights of Kane Tower glowed steady and bright,Victoria's empire, now Camille's inheritance.Between his building and hers lay the darkening shapes of a thousand other structures, a thousand other lives, none of them aware of the chess game being played above their heads.


His desk phone buzzed again.


"Mr.Pierce, William Gray from Morgan Stanley on line one. He's asking about your interest in acquiring distressed fashion assets."



Alexander moved to his desk, a small smile playing at his lips. So Rose had reached out to Morgan Stanley as well. Desperate times indeed. "William, good evening." He kept his tone pleasant,interested. "What assets are we discussing?"


"There's a fashion brand facing some temporary difficulties. Strong fundamentals, excellent design team,just needs a capital infusion to weather current PR issues."



"Rose Lewis's line?" Alexander asked, though he already knew the answer.


The pause on the other end confirmed it. "Yes. You've heard of the situation?"



"I make it my business to stay informed." Alexander opened his laptop, pulling up the contingency plan he'd prepared for this exact call. "Send me the prospectus. I'll review it tonight."


He had no intention of investing a penny in Rose's failing business. But expressing interest would keep other potential rescuers waiting, watching, wasting precious time while her brand sank further into crisis.


After ending the call, Alexander checked his other screen, where a different battle was being monitored.Three major shipping companies were circling Rodriguez Shipping, vultures sensing a dying animal.His team had quietly reached out to each one,suggesting they wait for the company's situation to deteriorate further before making acquisition offers. Why rush in, his people had suggested,when patience would yield a much lower purchase price?



His phone buzzed with an alert. Rodriguez Shipping stock had just hit another new low in after-hours trading. Eight percent down from yesterday's close.Another successful day in the systematic dismantling of Stefan Rodriguez's life.



Alexander should have felt only satisfaction. This was what he'd planned, helping Camille achieve her revenge while remaining invisible, repaying his debt to the woman who'd once saved him when he had nothing.


Instead, something uncomfortable stirred beneath his calculated exterior. Doubt. Concern. Questions about what all this destruction was doing to Camille's soul.


He'd walked a similar path once. Knew the cost of revenge. The way it hollowed you out even as it satisfied your darkest hunger.



His private elevator pinged, doors sliding open to admit his chief security officer, Marcus.



"The surveillance report you requested," Marcus said,placing a slim folder on Alexander's desk. "Ms. Kane's movements for the past week."



Alexander nodded his thanks, waiting until Marcus departed before opening the folder. Inside, photos showed Camille at various business meetings, charity functions, private dinners with Victoria. In each image,she appeared composed, confident, perfectly poised


Only someone who knew what to look for would notice the slight tension around her eyes. The carefully controlled movements. The practiced smiles that never quite reached her gaze.


He recognized the signs because he'd once worn the same mask. The face of someone consumed by revenge, hollowed out by its demands, questioning what would remain when the fire of hatred finally burned out.



Alexander moved to a hidden panel in his office wall,pressing his palm against the biometric scanner. The wall slid open, revealing a private safe. Inside,alongside documents worth billions and secrets that could topple governments, lay a small velvet box.



He removed it carefully, opening the lid to reveal the silver rose pendant. Four years he'd carried it, waiting for the right moment to return it to the woman who'd sat beside his hospital bed. Who'd paid his medical bills when his family abandoned him. Who'd shown kindness when he had nothing to offer in return.



The woman who now walked a path of destruction,not knowing he followed behind, helping clear obstacles, ensuring her success. Watching her transform from victim to avenger.


His phone rang again, the secure line connected to his most sensitive operations.



"Sir, Sterling Financial just announced an emergency audit of all shipping industry loans. Rodriguez Shipping stock is dropping in Asian markets."



"Monitor the situation," Alexander instructed. "And prepare the acquisition documents we discussed.When they hit rock bottom, I want to be ready to move."



Not to actually acquire anything, but to create the appearance of interest keeping other potential buyers away until Kane Industries could make their move.Another invisible thread pulled to aid Camille's revenge.



Alexander returned the pendant to its safe, closing the hidden panel before moving back to his desk. His screens displayed the ongoing destruction of two lives, Rose's fashion empire in tatters, Stefan's shipping dynasty crumbling. All according to plan. All proceeding perfectly.



He picked up his phone, fingers hovering over the keys. For weeks, he'd maintained a careful distance,offering only cryptic texts,watching Camille's revenge unfold from afar. Perhaps it was time for a more direct approach.



*The wolves circle the wounded prey. Both targets now seeking emergency financing, both being denied at every turn. Your move is proving most effective,little phoenix.*



He hesitated before sending it, knowing Victoria would disapprove of his involvement. Knowing Camille herself might resent his awareness of her plans.Knowing he was crossing a line between observer and participant.



But something in him needed her to know she wasn't alone in this battle. That someone understood the cost of what she was doing. That someone saw beyond the mask she wore.



He pressed send, then turned back to the window,watching his reflection in the darkened glass. The man looking back was unreadable, controlled, powerful everything he'd built himself to be after his own destruction and rebirth.



But beneath that carefully constructed exterior lay memories of a hospital room. Of gentle hands changing bandages. Of a quiet voice reading when pain kept him awake. Of kindness offered without expectation of return.

 His phone chimed with a response from Camille: *How do you always know?*



Alexander smiled slightly, typing his reply: *The same way I know when the wind changes direction or the tide turns. Some forces can be felt rather than seen.*


Her response came quickly: *You're a mystery I don't have time to solve right now.*


*Yet solve me you will, one day. When your current quest is complete.*



He waited, watching three dots appear and disappear several times before her final message arrived: *What makes you think it will ever be complete?*



The question carried weight beyond its simple words.He recognized the fear beneath it, the same fear he'd once faced. What happens when revenge is achieved?What remains of the person you were? What fills the void when hatred no longer drives every decision?



*Because all fires eventually burn out, little phoenix.The question is what rises from the ashes.*


No response followed. He hadn't expected one.Some questions had no easy answers, especially for someone still consumed by the flames.


Alexander returned to his desk, reviewing reports of the day's successful manipulations. Eastern Capital had declined Rodriguez Shipping's loan application, citing "concerns about management stability." Three more investors had backed away from Rose's fashion line after receiving anonymous information packets.Sterling Financial's emergency audit was causing ripples of concern throughout the shipping industry.



All pieces moving exactly as planned. All contributing to the systematic destruction of two people who had once destroyed Camille Lewis.



Tomorrow would bring more of the same. More blocked investors. More leaked information. More careful manipulation of markets and opinions. All invisible, all untraceable, all designed to complement Camille's more direct attacks.



His phone buzzed with a final text from Sarah: *Mission accomplished. Morgan Stanley will delay response to Rose Lewis until after the weekend. By then it will be too late for her production deadlines.*



Another victory. Another nail in the coffin of Rose's fashion dreams.



Alexander closed his laptop, gathering his coat to leave. Tonight he would attend the same Metropolitan Museum fundraiser as Camille, watching her from across the room, their shared secret a silent bond neither acknowledged.Tomorrow he would continue dismantling the financial foundations of her enemies, an uunseen ally in her quest for justice. Or revenge. Or whatever she chose to call the fire consuming her.


And when it was over, when Rose and Stefan lay broken beyond repair, he would be waiting. Ready to help her answer the question she wasn't yet ready to face.



What rises from the ashes when revenge is finally complete?

###Chapter 50



The Metropolitan Museum glowed with old-world grandeur, transformed for the annual Children's Heart Foundation gala.Crystal chandeliers cast golden light over Manhattan's elite as they paraded in designer gowns and bespoke tuxedos, diamonds glittering like stars brought down to earth. Waiters moved silently through the crowd with champagne flutes balanced on silver trays, while a string quartet played Mozart in the background.



Camille Kane stood near a display of ancient Greek sculptures, outwardly calm though her mind raced with calculations. This was her first major event without Victoria's watchful presence, a test of her ability to navigate the shark-infested waters of high society alone. She wore a midnight blue gown that whispered over marble floors as she moved, her surgical alterations and months of training giving her the confidence to meet curious stares with cool indifference.



"Ms. Kane," a silver-haired museum trustee approached, hand extended. "How wonderful to see you without your mother for once. She's kept you quite close since your emergence."


Camille offered the practiced smile Victoria had taught her, warm enough to seem approachable,reserved enough to maintain distance. "Mother had prior commitments in Chicago. The Children's Heart Foundation's work is too important to miss, however."



"Indeed, indeed. Your donation was most generous."



She nodded acknowledgment, already scanning the room for more strategic connections. The fundraiser's guest list included three potential Kane Industries partners, two board members from companies they were targeting for acquisition, and several financial journalists whose goodwill was worth cultivating.


Victoria had left detailed instructions on who to speak with, for how long, and what impressions to leave.Camille followed them methodically, moving from group to group with practiced grace. Yet beneath her polished exterior, satisfaction burned like banked coals. Earlier today, she'd received confirmation that Rose's last potential investor had pulled out. Her sister's fashion empire was now officially without financial lifelines.



Justice, she reminded herself. Not revenge. Justice for years of manipulation and betrayal.


A subtle shift in the crowded room caught her ople turning, murmuring, parting like the sea before an approaching force. Alexander Pierce had arrived.



Even among billionaires, Alexander cut a striking figure.Tall, broad-shouldered, with the lean build of someone who maintained physical discipline despite wealth that could afford any indulgence. His custom tuxedo fit like a second skin, emphasizing strength contained within civilization's boundaries. But it was his eyes that commanded attention, sharp gray that seemed to see through pretense, beyond social masks to the truths beneath.



Those eyes found her immediately, as if he'd been searching for her from the moment he entered. A slight smile curved his mouth when their gazes locked,not the practiced social expression others wore, but something more genuine. More dangerous.


Camille looked away first, unsettled by her reaction to him. She'd anticipated his presence tonight, of course.Alexander Pierce rarely missed major philanthropic events. But she hadn't prepared for the quickening of her pulse when he appeared, for the way awareness of him sharpened every other sense.



She moved deeper into the crowd, resuming her careful networking while maintaining awareness of his position in the room. He did the same, never approaching directly but remaining in her peripheral vision, their orbits drawing gradually closer without appearing to do so.


The museum director tapped a microphone, calling for attention. "Ladies and gentlemen, the highlight of tonight's auction is about to begin. If you would kindly move to the east gallery..."



The crowd flowed like an elegant current toward the auction area. Camille found herself positioned near the front, where a spotlight illuminated a glass display case. Inside, a diamond necklace caught and fractured light into rainbow prismatic brilliance.



"The Heart of Eternity," the auctioneer announced once everyone had settled. "Fifty-seven perfectly matched blue-white diamonds surrounding a twelve-carat blue diamond centerpiece.This one-of-a-kind creation has been donated anonymously, with proceeds benefiting the Children's Heart Foundation.We'll start the bidding at twenty million dollars."



A forest of paddles rose immediately. Thirty million.Forty. Fifty. The room buzzed with excitement as Manhattan's wealthiest competed for the privilege of philanthropy combined with acquisition.



Camille observed without participating. The necklace was stunning, certainly, but her focus tonight was business, not jewelry. She noted which financial titans bid, tracking alliances and rivalries through their participation or restraint.



"Sixty-five million," called a tech mogul whose software company had recently gone public.



"Seventy," countered a hedge fund manager whose wife already wore enough diamonds to sink a small boat.



The room grew quieter as the price climbed, fewer paddles rising with each increment. At eighty-five million, only three bidders remained. At ninety million,just two.



"Ninety-five million," said the hedge fund manager,confidence evident in his posture. Few people could surpass such an amount, even in this rarefied crowd.



A moment of silence stretched. The auctioneer raised his gavel. "Ninety-five million going once..."


"One hundred million."



The voice cut through the room like a blade,quiet yet perfectly projected. Heads turned toward Alexander Pierce, who hadn't bothered raising a paddle. He simply stood with hands in his pockets, expression revealing nothing of the fortune he'd just committed.



Murmurs swept the room. Not because of the amount,such sums were discussed daily in these circles, but because of who had offered it. Alexander Pierce, known  for ruthless business  acumen  and technological innovation, not extravagant displays or philanthropy beyond calculated tax benefits.



"One hundred million dollars," the auctioneer repeated,poorly concealing his excitement. "Going once..going twice... sold to Mr. Alexander Pierce!"


Applause filled the gallery. Social media teams discreetly positioned throughout the event quickly sent alerts to their platforms. By morning, this would be headline news, the record-breaking donation, the mysterious billionaire stepping into the spotlight.


Camille watched Alexander accept congratulations with minimal acknowledgment, his attention repeatedly returning to her location. What game was he playing? This performative generosity seemed unlike the calculated man she'd come to know through their brief interactions.



Museum staff removed the necklace from its display,transferring it to a midnight blue velvet box that coincidentally matched her gown. After signing necessary paperwork, Alexander received the box with a quick nod of thanks.


Then he turned and walked directly toward her.



The crowd parted instinctively, sensing a moment unfolding. Camille stood her ground, though every instinct warned of danger approaching. Not physical threat, but something potentially more damaging to all she and Victoria had built, unpredictability. Visibility.Attention they hadn't choreographed.


"Ms. Kane," Alexander said when he reached her, voice pitched for her ears alone despite the crowd straining to listen. "I find myself with an acquisition that would look far better on you than locked in my safe.".


Before she could respond, he opened the velvet box.The necklace caught light from overhead chandeliers,blue-white fire seeming to dance among the stones.



"I couldn't possibly," she began, the practiced response Victoria would expect.



"Of course you can," he countered softly. "Consider it a loan for the evening. To benefit the children."


His eyes held hers, challenging,teasing.Behind them,phone cameras discreetly captured the moment,society columnists watched avidly, witnesses to something unprecedented. Alexander Pierce offering a hundred-million-dollar necklace to Victoria Kane's mysterious daughter.

###Chapter 51



Camille turned to face him, found his eyes glinting with something that might have been admiration,might have been challenge, might have,been something deeper neither of them was prepared to name.



"The phoenix only rises through fire, Mr. Pierce," she replied quietly. "And fire is a dangerous element to play with."



His smile deepened, genuine amusement replacing careful social masks. "I've never feared burns, Ms.Kane. The most valuable things in life are often forged in flame."



Someone called for a photograph. The museum director, sensing promotional gold, encouraged them to stand together. Alexander placed his hand lightly at the small of her back, the gesture both possessive and protective.



Flashes erupted around them. Tomorrow these images would appear in every social publication,generating exactly the kind of attention Victoria had warned against. Speculation. Interest. Questions about  the relationship between two of the world's most powerful young billionaires.



"You planned this," Camille accused under her breath,maintaining her public smile.



"I seized an opportunity," he corrected. "There's a difference."



"Victoria won't be pleased."



"Victoria isn't here." His fingers pressed slightly against her back, surprisingly warm through the thin fabric of her gown. "And it's time you made decisions without her shadow over you."


The presumption should have angered her. Instead,something rebellious stirred inside her, the first independent choice since accepting Victoria's offer of transformation and revenge. Not a strategic business move. Not a calculated step toward destroying Rose and Stefan. Just a moment of genuine connection with someone who seemed to see through all her carefully constructed layers.



She smiled at him, not Victoria's practiced social expression, but something real. Something that belonged to her alone.



Camille recognized the trap. Refuse, and appear cold,ungracious,dampening the philanthropic spirit of the evening.Accept, and create exactly the kind of public speculation Victoria had carefully avoided around her adopted heir.



"The children," she repeated, finding her answer. "How could I refuse such a worthy cause?"


She turned slightly, presenting her back to him in silent permission. Alexander removed the necklace from its box and stepped behind her. The crowd fell into breathless silence.



His fingers brushed the nape of her neck as he positioned the necklace, the touch sending an unexpected shiver down her spine. The weight of diamonds settled against her skin, cool at first, then warming.His hands lingered perhaps a moment longer than necessary, his breath close enough that she felt its warmth against her ear.



"The phoenix rises," he whispered, words meant only for her. "And looks more magnificent with each transformation."



The watching crowd stirred in response. For months they had observed the Kane heiress at various events,always perfect, always controlled, always slightly unreachable. This smile transformed her from beautiful statue to living woman, the change subtle but unmistakable.



More photos captured the moment. More speculative glances exchanged between witnesses. More messages discreetly sent from the event, spreading news of what was unfolding.



Alexander's expression softened in response, his own mask slipping to reveal something unexpected,tenderness beneath the power, warmth beneath the controlled exterior. For a brief moment, they weren't two strategic players in a complex game of revenge and alliance, but simply a man and woman connected by something neither had planned.


Then the spell broke as the museum director approached, effusive with gratitude for Alexander's donation. Camille used the interruption to step away,one hand rising unconsciously to touch the fortune now adorning her throat.



For the remainder of the evening, they circled each other like planets in separate but intersecting orbits.Never directly engaging again, but always aware of the other's location. Always feeling the pull of connection neither had anticipated.



Near midnight, as the event wound down, Camille's security team approached to escort her to her waiting car. She reached back to unfasten the necklace,intending to return it.



Alexander materialized at her side. "Keep it tonight.My security will coordinate with yours for its return tomorrow."



"I couldn't possibly..."


"You can and you will." His voice carried no arrogance,just calm certainty. "It looks like it was made for you."


Before she could protest further, he leaned closer,his lips nearly brushing her ear. "Besides, little phoenix,what better way to celebrate your victory today?While you dazzled in diamonds, your sister lost her last financial lifeline. Your plan succeeded perfectly."



Camille froze, shock replacing composure.How did he know? How did he always know?



"Don't look so alarmed," he continued softly."Your secrets remain safe with me."



"What do you want?" she whispered. "Why are you doing this?"



He stepped back, his public mask returning seamlessly."That's a conversation for another time. Good night,Ms. Kane. You've made a dull charity event unexpectedly memorable."



With a slight bow that managed to be both formal and intimate,he walked away, leaving her standing with a hundred million dollars around her neck and questions burning in her mind.

In her car,Camille studied her reflection in the privacy screen, the elegant gown, the perfect makeup,the necklace that outshone everything else. But it was her eyes that held her attention, something awakening in them that had been absent for too long. Something that belonged to her, not to Victoria's careful creation.


Her phone buzzed with an incoming message.Alexander, she thought with unexpected anticipation.


But it was Victoria's name that appeared on the screen:*What have you done? The photos are already online.Call me immediately.*



Camille touched the diamonds at her throat,remembering Alexander's fingers against her skin,his whispered words in her ear. For the first time since agreeing to Victoria's plan, since burying Camille Lewis and becoming Camille Kane, she felt something beyond the cold satisfaction of revenge.



She closed the message without responding.



Victoria could wait until morning

###Chapter 52



Victoria Kane's hotel suite in Chicago offered a panoramic view of Lake Michigan, a vista most would stop to admire. She noticed none of it. Instead, her attention remained fixed on the tablet in her hand,fingers swiping through news article after news article,each headline worse than the last.



"BILLIONAIRE BACHELOR ALEXANDER PIERCE GIFTS $100M NECKLACE TO MYSTERIOUS KANE HEIRESS"



"POWER COUPLE ALERT: PIERCE AND KANE SEND SOCIAL MEDIA INTO FRENZY"





"FROM RECLUSE TO ROMANCE: HAS THE COLD-HEARTED TECH GENIUS FINALLY MET HIS MATCH?"



Each article featured the same photographs,Alexander placing the diamond necklace around Camille's throat, his hands lingering at her neck.Camille's genuine smile as she looked up at him, a softness in her expression Victoria had never seen before. The two of them standing together as if the crowded fundraiser had faded away, leaving them in a world of their own.
Victoria's manicured nail cracked the screen protector as she pressed too hard, swiping to the next tabloid story. This one included quotes from "anonymous attendees" describing how the normally reserved Camille Kane had "transformed" in Alexander's presence, becoming "radiant" and "openly warm"toward the man known for keeping everyone at a careful distance.



"Fifteen months of meticulous planning,"Victoria said to the empty room, voice dangerously quiet. "Fifteen months creating the perfect story. The perfect appearance. The perfect heir. All potentially compromised in a single evening."


She stood, moving to the window with controlled fury emanating from her rigid posture. The breakfast tray sat untouched on the nearby table. Sleep had been impossible after seeing the first alerts about the fundraiser. By dawn, the story had exploded across traditional and social media, analysts and gossip columnists alike speculating about the potential alliance between two of the world's most powerful young business figures.


Precisely the kind of attention they had carefully avoided. Precisely the visibility that could threaten everything they'd built.



Her phone rang....her assistant calling from New York.
"Tell me," Victoria demanded without greeting.


"It's worse than we thought," Rebecca said,her usually composed voice tight with tension. "Every major news outlet is running the story. Financial publications are analyzing potential business implications of a Pierce-Kane alliance. Social media engagement has increased seven thousand percent around Ms. Kane's name since last night."



Victoria's fingers tightened around the phone. "And Camille?"



"Not responding to messages. Her security detail reported she returned safely to the mansion at 12:47AM. The necklace remains in her possession. Mr.Pierce's security team is scheduled to retrieve it at noon today."



Another point of contact. Another opportunity for photographs. Another chance for Alexander to further whatever game he was playing.



"Cancel that retrieval," Victoria ordered. "Have our security return the necklace directly to Pierce Industries. Camille is not to have any further contact with Alexander Pierce or his people."



"Yes, Ms. Kane."



"What about the Pierce team? Any official statement from them about last night?"



"Nothing yet," Rebecca replied. "Though their stock opened four percent higher this morning, apparently on speculation about potential collaboration between your companies."



The market implications hadn't escaped Victoria's notice. Her own analysts had already sent tree separate reports about how Kane Industries stock was responding to the rumors. Under different circumstances, she might have considered the business advantages of a strategic alliance with Pierce's tech empire.



But these weren't different circumstances. This was a direct threat to her carefully constructed plan. To Camille's revenge. To everything they'd spent over a year building toward.


"Prepare the jet," Victoria said, decision made."I'm returning to New York immediately."


"Already done, Ms. Kane. The pilot filed a flight plan twenty minutes ago when I saw the Good Morning America segment about the gala."



Victoria almost smiled at her assistant's efficiency.This was why she kept loyal people close, they anticipated needs, solved problems before they fully materialized,protected her interests without requiring explicit instructions.



Unlike her adopted daughter, who had apparently abandoned all caution for the attention of Alexander Pierce.



"Have the car ready in fifteen minutes."



Victoria ended the call and moved to her closet,selecting a charcoal gray suit that projected authority without ostentation. As she dressed, her mind raced through the potential damage Alexander could cause.



He was dangerous in ways few people recognized.Not just for his wealth or business acumen, though both were considerable. Not just for his technological innovations, though they had disrupted multiple industries. No, Alexander Pierce posed a unique threat because he saw patterns others missed. Connections hidden beneath surface appearances. Motivations disguised behind careful social masks.



If anyone could pierce the veil they'd created around Camille's true identity, it would be him.


The question was, did he already know? Had he somehow uncovered the truth about Camille Lewis becoming Camille Kane? Was last night's public display a message to Victoria that he held information that could destroy everything they'd built?



As her security team escorted her to the waiting car, Victoria scrolled through more news alerts.Entertainment Tonight was now running a feature on "Alexander Pierce: The Man Behind the Mystery,"complete with archive footage of his rare public appearances over the years. CNN Business analyzed what a merger between Pierce Technologies and Kane Industries might mean for the global economy.Twitter had created a special hashtag-#PierceKane-that was already trending worldwide.


Victoria closed the alerts, jaw tight with controlled fury. In one evening, one impulsive decision, Camille had generated exactly the kind of attention they had carefully avoided for fifteen months. Attention that could lead to questions. To investigations. To someone making connections they couldn't afford.



The car moved smoothly through Chicago morning traffic toward the private airfield where her jet waited.Victoria used the time to review what she knew about Alexander Pierce... information compiled long before last night's incident.


Thirty-four years old. Fortune estimated at $180Trillion, primarily from revolutionary artificial intelligence technologies. Notoriously private. No known serious relationships since a broken engagement six years ago. Rumored to have an intelligence network that rivaled some government agencies. Considered by many to be Victoria's most formidable business rival, despite their companies operating in different sectors.


What she didn't know, and what troubled her most,was why he had suddenly taken such public interest in Camille.



Men like Alexander Pierce didn't make impulsive gestures. They didn't spend one hundred million dollars on spontaneous gifts. They didn't risk their carefully maintained public image without substantial reason.



Which meant last night was calculated. Planned.Executed with specific intent.



But what intent? A business alliance? A personal connection? Or something more troubling, knowledge of who Camille really was and where she had come from?



Victoria's security opened her car door as they reached the airfield. Her Gulfstream waited on the tarmac, engines already warmed, stairs extended in anticipation of her arrival.


"Ms. Kane," the pilot greeted her at the stairs. "We're cleared for immediate departure. Flight time to New York approximately one hour forty minutes."


She nodded acknowledgment, mind already rushing ahead to the confrontation waiting in New York. To the damage control needed. To the careful recalibration of their plan in light of this unexpected development.



On board, her phone rang again, Rebecca with another update.


package just arrived at the mansion for Ms. Kane,"she reported. "From Pierce Industries."



Victoria froze halfway to her seat. "The necklace being returned?"


"No. Security scanned it, appears to be a small jewelry box, but not large enough for the necklace. There's a handwritten note attached."



Of course there was. Another move in whatever game he was playing.



"Don't allow Camille to open it," Victoria instructed."Secure it in my office safe until I arrive."


"Yes, Ms. Kane. Also, Page Six just published what they're calling an 'inside scoop' on Ms. Kane and Mr.Pierce's history. They're claiming the two have been secretly meeting for months."



Victoria's fingers tightened around the phone."That's impossible. We monitor her schedule completely.Every minute is accounted for."



"The article suggests late-night meetings after

  official events. Quotes an anonymous source saying they've been observed in 'intense conversation' at several functions over the past three months."


Because they had been. Victoria had noticed their brief interactions at various events, had questioned Camille about them. Had accepted the explanation that Pierce was merely another business connection worth maintaining.



Clearly, she had been too trusting. Too willing to give her adopted daughter the freedom to manage certain social relationships independently. A mistake she wouldn't repeat.



"Continue monitoring media coverage," Victoria instructed. "Have the PR team prepare three different statement drafts - one business-focused, one dismissing the speculation entirely, one acknowledging a professional relationship but nothing more."



The jet accelerated down the runway, pressing Victoria back into the leather seat. As they lifted into the morning sky, she stared out at the shrinking city below, mind turning over possibilities, threats,countermoves.



Alexander Pierce wouldn't interfere with their plans.Wouldn't derail Camille's revenge with whatever game he was playing. Victoria had invested too much,emotionally, financially, strategically, to allow an outside force to disrupt what they'd built.


When the plane reached cruising altitude, she opened her laptop to review the latest media coverage.What troubled her most was Pierce Industries' complete silence. No denials. No clarifications. No attempt to quell the romantic speculation racing through the media.



This was calculated. Deliberate. His silence allowed rumors to grow unchecked, creating a narrative he could have easly dismissed with a simple press statement.



Even more disturbing was Camille's similar silence. No message to Victoria explaining her actions. No attempt to control the story. Just acceptance of the public attention they had so carefully avoided for fifteen months.



Victoria refreshed the news feed again. Still nothing from Pierce's team - just more analyst speculation about what the "obvious personal connection"between the two might mean for future business alignments. His silence spoke volumes about his intentions, whatever they might be.



Victoria closed the laptop, a rare display of emotion as she struggled to contain her rage. In eighteen hours,Alexander Pierce had done more to threaten their carefully constructed plan than Stefan and Rose's combined efforts to save their crumbling empires.



This wasn't just about unwanted publicity now. This was direct interference in their operation. In their relationship. In the revenge plan they'd spent over a year executing with meticulous precision.


As the jet began its descent toward New York, Victoria made her decision. The time for subtle countermoves had passed. Alexander Pierce needed to understand exactly who he was dealing with, and what happened to those who threatened Victoria Kane's plans.



She would protect what was hers. Would secure Camille's focus on their original goal. Would eliminate the distraction Pierce represented before he could further complicate their carefully orchestrated destruction of Rose and Stefan.



Looking out at the Manhattan skyline coming into view,Victoria felt her determination harden into resolve.Pierce Tower stood among the skyscrapers, a gleaming monument to one man's technological empire.



An empire that had just made a serious miscalculation by targeting her daughter.
###Chapter 53



Sunlight streamed through the tall windows of Camille's private suite, warming the polished wood floors and catching the fire of diamonds still resting on her dressing table. She hadn't returned the necklace to its velvet box last night, instead leaving it where she could see it when she woke this morning,a physical reminder that the events at the museum hadn't been a dream.



Her phone lit up with another notification. The fifth news alert in twenty minutes. She reached for it,already knowing what she'd find. Another article.Another photo. Another round of speculation about her and Alexander Pierce.



This one came from the Business Insider: "WALL STREET ABUZZ:KANE-PIERCE CONNECTION SENDS MARKETS SOARING." The photograph showed them standing together beneath the museum chandeliers,Alexander's hand resting lightly at the small of her back,her face turned up toward his with an expression of genuine warmth that looked foreign even to her own eyes.



Camille scrolled through the article, noting the financial analysis buried beneath the romantic speculation.Kane Industries stock up seven percent in pre-market trading. Pierce Technologies up nearly nine percent. Investors apparently enthralled by the possibility of connection between two business empires previously seen as potential rivals.



She set the phone down, gaze returning to the necklace. One hundred million dollars in diamonds,casually placed around her neck by a man who treated the extraordinary amount as if it were nothing more than a suitable accessory for her gown.


Her fingers rose unconsciously to her throat,remembering the moment. The hushed crowd watching. The slight pressure of Alexander's hands at her nape. The warmth of his breath near her ear as he whispered words meant only for her.


"The phoenix rises. And looks more magnificent with each transformation."



No one had spoken to her that way since her rebirth as Camille Kane. Most people approached with cautious deference, aware of her wealth and Victoria's protection.	Business	associates	maintained professional distance. Social contacts remained superficially pleasant but never genuine.



Only Alexander seemed to see beyond the careful facade, beyond Victoria's creation, to something she herself sometimes forgot existed. The real woman beneath the surgical alterations and practiced mannerisms.



Her phone buzzed again. A text this time, not a news alert. Alexander's name appeared on the screen,sending an unwelcome flutter through her chest.



*Good morning, little phoenix. I tust the diamonds made it home safely with you.*



She hesitated, knowing Victoria would disapprove of encouraging further contact. Knowing everything they'd built could be compromised by connection to someone as perceptive as Alexander Pierce.



But Victoria wasn't here. And something about Alexander's attention made her feel alive in ways she'd almost forgotten.



She typed a response: *The diamonds are fine. When should I expect your security to retrieve them?*



His reply came immediately: *Keep them.*



She stared at the two simple words, sure she'd misunderstood. Keep a hundred-million-dollar necklace? Impossible.



*| can't accept such a gift,* she wrote back.



*Not a gift. A loan. Until our next meeting.* The implication that there would be a next meeting sent another flutter through her chest, anticipation mixed with caution.



*And when might that be?* she asked, abandoning pretense that she wasn't interested.



*Sooner than Victoria would prefer. Later than I would like.*



The mention of Victoria brought reality crashing back.The carefully constructed plan. The systematic revenge against Rose and Stefan. The identity she'd built under Victoria's guidance. All potentially threatened by whatever game Alexander was playing.



Before she could respond, another text appeared: *The phoenix looks toward the sun, not back at the ashes it rose from. Remember that when Victoria returns with her warnings about me.*



How did he know Victoria was returning early? How did he always seem to know things he shouldn't?



*What are you really after, Alexander?* she typed,needing to understand his motivations.



Three dots appeared as he composed a response.Disappeared.Appeared again.Whatever he was writing,he kept revising Finally:*The same thing you are, beneath your quest for revenge. A second chance at living, not just surviving.*


The words struck deeper than she wanted to admit.Beyond her careful plans with Victoria, beyond the systematic destruction of Rose and Stefan's lives,had she considered what came after? What she would be when revenge no longer defined her?



Her bedroom door opened without warning. Victoria stood in the threshold, still wearing her travel clothes,face tight with controlled anger.



"I see you're awake," Victoria said, gaze immediately finding the necklace on the dressing table. "And still in possession of Pierce's... gesture."


Camille set her phone down, screen darkened to hide Alexander's messages. "I was about to arrange its return."



"That's being handled. My security team will deliver it directly to Pierce Industries this afternoon." Victoria entered the room, closing the door firmly behind her."What were you thinking last night?"



The direct confrontation was unusual. Victoria typically employed more subtle methods of expressing disapproval, pointed questions, carefully chosen silences, implied disappointment rather than direct accusations.



"I was thinking about maintaining the positive impression you've worked so hard to create," Camille replied, falling back on reasons Victoria would understand. "Refusing such a public gesture would have appeared ungracious."



"And accepting it has created exactly the kind of attention we've carefully avoided for fifteen months."Victoria moved to the windows, adjusting the blinds to soften the morning light. A small action that asserted control over even the sunlight entering the room."Every major news outlet is running the story. Social media can speak of nothing else. Your name linked repeatedly with Alexander Pierce."



"I didn't anticipate the level of interest."



"No," Victoria agreed, turning back to face her. "But he did. This was calculated, Camille. Planned to create precisely this outcome."



Camille felt a flare of defensiveness, surprising in its intensity. "Not everything is a strategic move.Perhaps he simply...."



"Men like Alexander Pierce do nothing without multiple motives," Victoria cut her off. "Everything is calculated. Everything serves a purpose. The question is not whether he had reasons for last night's display, but what those reasons might be."



The statement carried uncomfortable echoes of Alexander's own words about Victoria. Everyone playing chess while others played checkers. Everyone seeing moves ahead while maintaining their carefully constructed masks.



"What do you think his motives are?" Camille asked,genuinely curious about Victoria's assessment.



"Business advantage, most likely," Victoria said firmly."Pierce Technologies and Kane Industries have several overlapping interests. An alliance, even one rumored rather than formalized, could position him favorably in markets where we currently hold advantage."



Victoria moved to the dressing table, studying the necklace without touching it. "This was a message. To the business world. To competitors. A declaration of interest that forces everyone to speculate, driving up both our stock prices while giving him time to position his next move."



"And how should we respond?"



"We return the necklace. We ignore the speculation We focus on our plan." Victoria's voice hardened."Rose's fashion empire is collapsing. Stefan's shipping company teeters on bankruptcy. We are weeks away from complete victory. This is not the time for distractions."






The word "distractions" carried weight beyond its surface meaning. Victoria wasn't just concerned about media attention. She was worried about Camille's focus. About emotional entanglements that might complicate their carefully orchestrated revenge.



"Alexander Pierce is dangerous," Victoria continued."Not just because of his resources or intelligence. But because he makes you forget who you are andwhy we started this."



The accusation stung because it contained truth. Last night, standing close to Alexander, feeling his attention focused solely on her, Camille had forgotten about Rose and Stefan. Had thought only of the connection forming between them, unexpected and unexplainable.



"I haven't forgotten anything," Camille said, more sharply than intended."One evening doesn't erase a year of planning. One necklace doesn't change who l am or what I'm doing."



Victoria studied her with that penetrating gaze that always made Camille feel transparent. "Doesn't it?I saw the photographs, Camille. I saw your expression when he placed that necklace around your throat That wasn't Camille Kane, heir to my empire. That was someone | don't recognize."


"Perhaps that's because you've never allowed me to be anyone but who you created," Camille replied, the words escaping before she could contain them.



Silence fell between them, heavy with implications.This was new territory, Camille pushing back,questioning Victoria's control, suggesting there might be identity beyond the one they'd carefully constructed together.



Before Victoria could respond, a knock came at the door. Rebecca entered, tablet in hand, expression professionally neutral despite the tension evident in the room.



"Forgive the interruption," she said. "The PR team has completed their analysis of this morning's media coverage. They believe an immediate response is necessary."



Victoria held out her hand for the tablet. "I've already decided our approach. We'll issue a statement thanking Mr. Pierce for his generous donation to the Children's Heart Foundation while making it clear that any romantic speculation is unfounded. The necklace will be returned this afternoon with..."



"Actually," Rebecca interrupted, a rare occurrence that drew both women's attention, "the team strongly recommends against dismissing the speculation."
 
###Chapter 54



Victoria's eyebrows rose slightly. "Explain."



"Kane Industries stock is up nearly eight percent since market opening. Pierce Technologies up over nine percent. The market clearly approves of the perceived connection." Rebecca scrolled through her notes."Social media sentiment analysis shows ninety-three percent positive reaction to the... pairing.The PR team believes this presents a unique opportunity to strengthen both the Kane Industries brand and Ms.Kane's personal public image."



Victoria's expression remained unchanged,but Camille caught the slight tightening of her fingers on the tablet, the only outward sign of her displeasure.



"Public perception is notoriously fickle," Victoria replied. "Today's approval can become tomorrow's scandal. We built Camille's image on foundations of dignity, intelligence, grace and appropriate distance.Not tabloid romance."



"With respect," Rebecca continued, clearly aware she was treading dangerous ground, "the team believes this development humanizes Ms. Kane in ways fifteen  months of careful image management never achieved.The public has respected her, but now they're connecting with her emotionally. That creates loyalty beyond business considerations."



Camille watched the exchange with growing interest Rebecca making a direct case against Victoria's preferred approach was unprecedented. The PR team risking Victoria's disapproval suggested they truly believed this development benefited Kane Industries.



"And what exactly are they recommending?" Victoria asked,voice deceptively mild.


"Neither confirmation nor denial. Allow the speculation to continue. Maintain normal business operations while permitting the narrative to develop organically." Rebecca glanced briefly at Camille before continuing. "They've prepared three potential public appearances where Ms. Kane might be seen without directly addressing the rumors."



Victoria handed the tablet back to Rebecca. "Tell them I'll consider their recommendations and provide direction this afternoon."



When Rebecca departed, silence filled the room again.Victoria moved to stand near the windows, back straight,hands clasped behind her. Her thinking pose,one Camille had observed countless times during strategy sessions. "The PR team makes valid points from a business perspective," Victoria said finally. "The market reaction is significant. The public engagement metrics show clear advantages."



Camille waited, knowing there was more.



"But they don't understand what's truly at stake."Victoria turned to face her. "This isn't just about stock prices or public perception. This is about completing what we started. About justice for what was done to you."



The reminder sent memories flooding back, Rose's betrayal, Stefan's abandonment, her parents blindness to manipulation happening before their eyes. The systematic destruction of Camille Lewis's life,orchestrated by those who should have protected her.



"Pierce is a complication we didn't anticipate," Victoria continued. "A variable that could disrupt everything we've built. Whatever his motives, whatever his interest in you, we cannot afford the distraction he represents."



Camille looked down at her phone, remembering Alexander's last message. The phoenix looks toward the sun, not back at the ashes it rose from.



"What if..." she began carefully, "what if we could use this to our advantage? The attention. The connection people believe exists between Pierce and me."


Victoria's eyes narrowed slightly."HOW?"



"Rose and Stefan monitor business news obsessively now that their companies are failing. They'll have seen this morning's coverage. The speculation about Pierce and Kane Industries potentially aligning." Camille stood, moving to the dressing table where the necklace still lay. "Imagine their reaction. Their growing desperation as they see not just their personal lives crumbling, but potential business alliances forming that could crush any hope of recovery."



Understanding dawned in Victoria's expression. "You're suggesting we allow the speculation to continue. Not for public relations benefits, but as another weapon in our arsenal against them."



"Exactly." Camille lifted the necklace, diamonds catching morning light. "Let them see me not just taking everything they valued, but gaining things they never had.Power. Connections. Potential alliance with the one man whose resources is bigger than yours."



Victoria considered this, head tilted slightly.interesting approach. Psychological warfare beyond mere financial destruction."
It adds another dimension to their defeat," Camille agreed. "Not just losing everything they built, but watching me potentially gain everything they could never achieve."



For several moments, Victoria said nothing, clearly weighing the proposal against her concerns. Finally,she nodded once, decision made.



"We'll delay returning the necklace. Allow the speculation to continue for now. But," her voice hardened again, "we maintain control of the narrative.No unplanned interactions with Pierce. No statements without my approval. No deviations from our core strategy."



"Of course," Camille agreed, relief washing through her for reasons she wasn't ready to examine too closely.



Victoria moved toward the door, pausing before leaving. "One more thing, Camille. Do not trust Alexander Pierce. Whatever his interest in you appears to be, remember that men like him always have deeper motives than they reveal."



After Victoria departed, Camille returned to the window, necklace still clutched in her hand. Outside,spring had transformed the mansion's gardens, new growth pushing through soil that had been frozen just weeks earlier. Life emerging after dormancy. Beauty following barrenness.


Her phone buzzed with another text from Alexander: *Has the storm arrived yet? Victoria's plane landed twenty minutes ago.*



She smiled despite herself, typing back: *Storm weathered. The necklace stays, for now.*



His response came quickly: *The phoenix gains wisdom.Looking forward to our next encounter, little warrior.*



Camille traced the diamonds with her fingertip,remembering the weight of Alexander's hands at her neck, the warmth of his breath near her ear. For months she had focused solely on destroying Rose and Stefan, on executing Victoria's careful plan for justice through systematic revenge.


Now, for the first time, she found herself looking beyond that single goal. Wondering what might exist after revenge was complete. Who she might become when hatred no longer defined her purpose



The phoenix looks toward the sun, not back at the ashes it rose from.



Perhaps Alexander Pierce wasn't just a complication in Victoria's carefully orchestrated plan. Perhaps he was something else entirely, a glimpse of possibility beyond the single-minded focus on revenge that had consumed her since the night she'd signed those divorce papers.


The thought should have frightened her. Instead, she found herself smiling as she slipped the diamond necklace back into its velvet box.



Victoria was right about one thing, Alexander Pierce was dangerous. But not perhaps in the way she believed.



The real danger wasn't to their revenge plan, but to the walls Camille had built around her heart since the night she'd died as Camille Lewis and been reborn as Camille Kane.



Walls that, for the first time since her transformation,showed signs of beginning to crack.
###Chapter 55



The morning light poured through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Alexander's office, turning the polished wood of his desk golden. He stood with his back to the room,hands clasped behind him,watching the city awaken sixty floors below. The view from Pierce Tower offered a perfect vantage point to observe Manhattan without being observed in return, a fitting metaphor for how he preferred to operate in all aspects of life.



Behind him, Sarah cleared her throat softly. She had perfected the art of commanding his attention without seeming to demand it.



"The morning briefing is ready," she said, tablet poised in her hands. At thirty-two, Sarah Matthews maintained the efficiency that had made her invaluable to Alexander's rise. Brown streaked her dark hair, but her mind remained razor-sharp, her loyalty unquestioned.



Alexander turned from the window. "Begin with the market response."



"Pierce Technologies stock opened at a record high this morning. Up twelve percent since yesterday's close." Sarah's voice held the faintest hint of approval. "Financial analysts are attributing the jump to speculation about potential alliance with Kane Industries following last night's... display at the museum fundraiser."



Alexander's lips curved slightly. Display. Such a careful choice of words. Sarah had watched him maintain perfect emotional distance from the world for years. His public gesture toward Camille Kane represented a deviation from pattern that she was too diplomatic to directly question.



"And Kane Industries?"



"Similar gains. Nearly ten percent increase in pre-market trading." Sarah swiped to the next screen on her tablet. "Social media metrics show unprecedented engagement around both companies. The hashtag PierceKane is trending globally, with sentiment analysis showing ninety-six percent positive reactions."



Alexander moved to his desk, lifting a small silver frame that had appeared there this morning. Inside, a photograph from last night, himself placing the diamond necklace around Camille's throat, her face turned slightly toward his, genuine emotion visible in her expression. Sarah's work, no doubt. She missed nothing, anticipated everything.

"Media coverage?" he asked, setting the frame back on his desk.





"Extensive. Every major news outlet, financial publication, and social platform is running the story."Sarah's efficiency never wavered, even when delivering information she knew would displease him."Your office has received one hundred seventy-three media requests for comment in the past four'hours.The PR team is awaiting your direction on how to respond."



Alexander nodded, unsurprised. The public gesture had been calculated to generate precisely this reaction.Not for the publicity itself he had always avoided the spotlight when possible, but for the specific effect it would have on one woman currently ensconced in her mansion across town, likely facing similar reports from her own team.



"What's the current messaging recommendation from PR?"





Sarah consulted her tablet again. "They've prepared three options. First, no comment at all, maintaining your usual privacy. Second, a brief statement confirming your attendance at the fundraiser while declining to discuss personal matters. Third, a more detailed response acknowledging Ms. Kane while framing the interaction in purely professional terms."
Alexander moved back to the window, considering.Each option carried different implications, different potential outcomes, different effects on Camille's position with Victoria. The chess game required careful moves, particularly now that Victoria had returned early from Chicago,another development his sources had confirmed an hour ago.



"None of those will suffice," he said finally. "Draft a new statement."





Sarah's pen hovered over her notepad, she still preferred handwriting for direct dictation. "Your preferred approach?"


Alexander turned, decision made. "Positive acknowledgment. Express that I was honored to place the necklace on a woman whose intelligence and beauty would capture any man's attention. Note my admiration for her business acumen. Mention hope for future collaborations that would benefit both our companies."



Sarah wrote quickly, but her eyebrows lifted slightly,the most surprise she would ever show in his presence."That's considerably more... personal than your usual statements."



"It needs to be." Alexander picked up the photograph again,studying Camille's expression. The vulnerability beneath her careful composure. The genuine emotion breaking through Victoria's programming. "Make it clear that while I typically avoid public attention, some moments merit breaking pattern."


"The board won't like it," Sarah noted,ever practical."Mr. Harrington specifically has expressed concern about media speculation affecting the Anderson merger negotiations."



"The board's concerns are noted. Remind them that Pierce Technologies stock is up twelve percent due to this 'distraction.'" Alexander set the photograph down again. "Have the statement emphasize my respect for Ms. Kane's professional achievements before mentioning any personal admiration. That should satisfy the board's concerns about maintaining our business-focused image."



Sarah finished writing, then looked up with the directness that made her invaluable. "Is there anything else you'd like included? Perhaps regarding the necklace itself?"



Alexander considered the question. The hundred-million-dollar diamond piece now rested with Camille,despite Victoria's likely insistence on its immediate return. His sources confirmed that Kane Industries 'security had not yet moved to deliver it back to Pierce Tower, suggesting either ongoing internal debate or, more promisingly, Camille asserting independence from Victoria's control.
"Add that the necklace was intended as a gesture of appreciation for Kane Industries' charitable contributions, but that seeing it on Ms. Kane convinced me it had found its rightful home." He paced slowly across his office. "Imply, without directly stating, that the piece was always meant as a gift rather than a temporary loan."



This would force Victoria's hand. Either allow Camille to keep a hundred-million-dollar gift from Alexander Pierce, creating ongoing connection between them,or insist on its return despite public perception that doing so would appear ungracious. Either outcome served his purposes.



"Will that be all for the statement?" Sarah asked,finishing her notes.





"One final addition." Alexander stopped pacing,turning to face her directly. "Express hope that Ms.Kane and I might collaborate on future philanthropic endeavors, as we seem to share similar values regarding children's medical research."



Sarah nodded, making the final notation. "I'll have this drafted and ready for your approval within the hour.When would you like it released?"



"Time it to coincide with the New York market's lunch hour. Maximum visibility without appearing rushed to respond." Alexander returned to his desk, mind already moving to the next phase of his strategy."And Sarah?Have security prepare the secondary gift."


Her pen paused above her notepad. "The rose pendant?"





"No." Alexander opened his desk drawer, removing a small blue velvet box. Inside, nestled on white silk,lay a pair of sapphire earrings, modest compared to the necklace, but exquisitely crafted and perfectly matched to its blue diamonds. "These. To be delivered personally, not through our usual couriers. Marcus should take them directly to Ms. Kane with a handwritten note."



Sarah accepted the box, tucking it carefully into her portfolio. If she had questions about this unprecedented level of personal attention toward anyone,her professional demeanor revealed nothing.



"The note is in the top drawer," Alexander continued."Sealed envelope with Ms. Kane's name."


Words he'd spent hours crafting last night, long after returning from the museum. Words chosen carefully to speak to the woman beneath Victoria's creation. To the phoenix rising from ashes not of her own making.To Camille Lewis, hidden beneath Camille Kane's perfect exterior.



Sarah slipped the envelope into her portfolio alongside the earrings. "Delivery timing?"



"Two hours after the press statement goes live. Let the media narrative develop first."


She nodded, making note of the instruction. "Will there be anything else?"


Alexander hesitated, then moved to the hidden safe behind his office artwork. Opening it with practiced movements,he withdrew a slim folder marked only with a date, four years earlier. Inside lay hospital records,financial transactions, and photographs from his recovery after the accident that had nearly claimed his life.



Including one image he had looked at countless times over the years, himself in a hospital bed, barely conscious, and beside him a young woman reading from a dog-eared paperback. Her face in partial shadow, but her kindness evident in every line of her body. In the gentle way she held the book. In how she'd sat with him through the darkest hours when his family had abandoned him to his fate.



"One more thing," he said, closing the folder without removing the photograph. "Schedule a donation to Boston Memorial Hospital's volunteer program. Ten million. Anonymous."



Sarah raised an eyebrow but made the note without comment. She had long ago learned not to question the seemingly random charitable donations Alexander made throughout the year. Each had purpose, though he rarely explained their significance.



"That's all for now," he said, returning the folder to his safe.



After Sarah departed, Alexander returned to the window,watching clouds cast moving shadows across the city below. His phone buzzed with an incoming message, another update from his source in Kane Industries. V/ictoria had indeed returned early from Chicago, and was now locked in meetings with her PR team about how to respond to the situation.



Just as he'd anticipated. Just as he'd planned. Each move in the complex game unfolding exactly as projected.



But games implied winners and losers. This was something else entirely. Something less strategic and more...personal than he typically allowed himself.


His phone buzzed again. Private line this time. Camille.



*Victoria wants the necklace returned today. I've convinced her to delay. For now.*


Alexander smiled slightly, typing his response: *The phoenix learns to navigate storms. Tell me, did she mention concern about my motives?* Camille's reply came quickly: *She believes it's about business advantage. Pierce Technologies seeking alliance with Kane Industries through personal connection.*



Not entirely wrong, but nowhere near the complete truth. Victoria Kane, for all her strategic brilliance,had missed the most important piece of the puzzle. Had failed to recognize what had brought Alexander into Camille's orbit in the first place.



Had not yet realized that her carefully constructed heir had crossed paths with Alexander long before becoming Camille Kane.


*An interesting theory,* he replied. *Let her believe what she finds comfortable. The truth will reveal itself in time.*



He set the phone down, returning to the window and his contemplation of the city spread below.Somewhere out there,Rose Lewis watched her fashion empire crumble. Stefan Rodriguez struggled to save his family's shipping legacy. Both experiencing the systematic destruction Camille had engineered with Victoria'sguidance.



Both unaware that their doom had been hastened by his invisible hand, blocking potential investors,spreading damaging information, accelerating their downfall through means they would never trace back 
to him.



All to help the woman who had once shown him kindness when he had nothing to offer in return. The woman who now wore a different face but whose essential nature remained unchanged beneath Victoria's careful.programming.


His phone rang - the secure line connected directly to his chief intelligence officer. "Report," Alexander answered without preamble.



"Victoria Kane has just authorized a statement from their PR department," came the response. "Release scheduled for 11 AM. Content suggests they're taking a neutral approach, neither confirming nor denying romantic speculation, while emphasizing Kane Industries' commitment to charitable causes."



Interesting. Not an outright rejection of connection, as Victoria would have preferred. Not complete embrace of the speculation, as might benefit their stock prices.A careful middle path that allowed them to observe market reaction before committing further.



"Forward me the full statement when it goes live,"Alexander instructed before ending the call.


His press release would follow two hours later, more directly positive about Camille, more openly appreciative, more clearly suggesting possibility beyond mere business alliance. The contrast would fuel another news cycle. Would generate more speculation. Would further complicate Victoria's carefully controlled narrative.


Alexander sat at his desk, opening the dossier his team had compiled on Camille Lewis before her "death" and transformation into Camille Kane. Photos showed a softer face,longer hair,less confident posture.But the eyes remained the same, intelligent, observant,hiding depth beneath careful social masks.



The same eyes that had watched over him during his hospital recovery. That had seen value in him when his family saw only failure and disappointment.


Eyes he would never forget,regardless of what facial alterations might surround them.





His phone buzzed with another message from Camille:*You never answered my question yesterday.What exactly are you after, Alexander?*


He considered his response carefully, fingers hovering over keys. How much to reveal? How much to withhold? The balance between truth and strategy required delicate calibration.


*Justice,* he typed finally. *The same thing you seek,though perhaps through different methods.*

 
Her response showed the sharp mind that had captured his attention from the beginning: *Justice for whom? And against whom?*


More than he was ready to reveal. More than she was ready to hear.


*All in good time, little phoenix. For now, know that your path and mine align more closely than Victoria would ever believe possible.*



Setting his phone aside, Alexander returned to preparing for his next move in the complex game surrounding Camille Kane. The press statement would go out at noon. The sapphire earrings would arrive at two. Victoria would be forced to recalibrate her careful control of Camille's public image and private actions.



And beneath it all, the truth waited to be revealed when the moment was right. When Camille was ready to hear it. When Victoria's influence had weakened enough for Camille to make truly independent choices.


The truth that Alexander Pierce had been helping her revenge from the shadows all along. Had been protecting her, supporting her, clearing obstacles from her path without revealing his presence or his motives.



Had been repaying a debt of kindness with a dedication that went beyond mere obligation, beyond strategic alliance, beyond anything that could be explained through business logic alone.



A dedication that had grown from gratitude into something deeper, something more dangerous,something he had not allowed himself to feel in the years since his family's betrayal had taught him the cost of emotional vulnerability.


Something that looked uncomfortably like hope.
###Chapter 56



Rain lashed against the penthouse windows, matching the storm brewing inside. Rose stared at Stefan across the living room, his posture rigid as he clutched his phone in a white-knuckled grip. The text message glowed on the screen between them, another buyer canceling their order, another financial blow to her already crumbling fashion empire.



"That's the third cancellation today," Rose said,fighting to keep her voice steady. "Bergdorf claims 'brand association concerns.' As if they've suddenly developed a moral conscience."



Stefan didn't look up. "Did yousleep with him too?"



"What?"



"The Bergdorf buyer." His voice held a coldness she'd never heard before. "Did you sleep with him like you did with Jonathan Hayes? Like you did with Lord Hartley? Like you apparently did with half of London while I was here, thinking about you every day?"


Rose flinched as if he'd slapped her. "That's not fair."
"Fair?" Stefan finally looked up, eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep. "The photos are everywhere, Rose. The financial records linking you to Bessonov. The evidence keeps piling up, and every time I think l've seen the worst, something new emerges."



She moved to the bar, pouring herself a drink with hands that trembled slightly. Three weeks since the first scandal photos had emerged. Three weeks of constant new revelations, each one more damaging than the last. Three weeks of watching everything she'd built crumble beneath her.



"Those photos are from years ago," she said,the defense sounding weak even to her own ears. "Before us.Before..."



"Before us?" Stefan laughed, a harsh sound devoid of humor."The timestamps, Rose. Did you think no one would notice the timestamps? You were on that yacht with Bessonov the same week you called me from 'Paris' to say how much you missed me. The same month you told me you were focusing on your fashion education."



Rose drained her glass, the alcohol burning a path down her throat. Outside, lightning flashed, briefly illuminating the rain-drenched city below.



"Everyone has a past," she tried again. "Things they're not proud of. Things they'd rather forget."


"A past is one thing. Lies are another." Stefan moved to the window, putting distance between them. "I could have accepted mistakes, Rose. I could have understood poor choices. What I can't accept is that everything, everything, you ever told me was manufactured. Calculated."


The truth of his words stung more than she wanted to admit. Her entire life had been a series of careful calculations, strategic moves to achieve the position,the power, the prestige she'd always craved.



"That's not true," she said, voice smaller than intended."My feelings for you were real. Are real."


"Were they?" He turned to face her again. "Or was I just part of your plan? A stepping stone to the life you wanted? The same way my company was a stepping stone for your fashion line's shipping needs?"


Rose set down her glass with more force than necessary. "That's not fair. My business success came from talent, from hard work, from..."



"From sleeping with your mentor's husband to steal design concepts?" Stefan cut in. "From using Bessonov's money to fund youur first collection? From manipulating fashion editors into featuring your work?"



Each accusation landed like a physical blow. All the carefully hidden truths, all the meticulously buried ecrets, exposed for everyone to see. For Stefan to see.



"You don't understand," she said, desperation creeping into her voice. "I did what I had to do. Coming from nothing, having nothing... you can't judge me for fighting my way up."


"Coming from nothing?" Stefan's expression shifted from anger to confusion. "Your parents are wealthy.You grew up with every advantage."



Rose froze, realizing her mistake too late. Another calculation error in a month filled with them. Another slip that revealed more than intended.


"I meant... professionally," she backtracked quickly. "In the fashion world, no one takes you seriously without the right connections. I had to make my own way."


Stefan studied her, suspicion replacing confusion."You've never talked about your life before the Lewises adopted you. Not once in all the years I've known you."


"Because it doesn't matter." Rose turned away,reaching for the bottle again. "That was a different life.A different person."



"Was it?" Stefan moved closer, his voice softening dangerously. "Or is this just another story you've constructed? Another manipulation to get what you want?"



Rose's hand tightened around her glass. "You don't know what you're talking about."


"I think I'm finally starting to." He picked up his phone again, swiping through more headlines about her scandals. "All these photos. All these stories. They're not just about affairs or business dealings. They're showing me who you really are, Rose. Who you've always been."


"And who is that?" she demanded, anger flaring to mask the fear beneath.



"Someone who takes what she wants, regardless of who gets hurt." Stefan's voice was steady now, his initial rage cooling into something more dangerous,clarity. "Someone who sees people as stepping stones rather than human beings. Someone who's been playing a role for so long she's forgotten there was ever anything genuine underneath."


The assessment hit too close to truth. Rose switched tactics,moving toward him with practiced vulnerability,eyes softening in the way she knew had always worked on him before.



"Stefan, please. This is all just a misunderstanding. A smear campaign by someone who wants to destroy me. Destroy us." She reached for his hand. "We can get through this together. Save both our businesses.Show everyone they can't tear us apart."



He pulled away from her touch. "That's just it, Rose.I don't think there's an 'us' to save. I'm not sure there ever was."



The rejection staggered her. Stefan had always been her safety net. Her sure thing. The man who would stand by her no matter what, who had carried a torch for her even through his marriage to Camille.



"You don't mean that," she whispered.


"I wish I didn't." He ran a hand through his disheveled hair. "You know what keeps me awake at night? Not the company collapsing. Not my father's disappointment. It's thinking about how I treated Camille. How I was cold to her, distant, always comparing her to some idealized version of you l'd created in my head."



Rose felt the conversation sliding into dangerous territory. "Camille is gone, Stefan. We've both mourned her. This isn't about her."



"Isn't it?" His eyes locked with hers. "I left a good woman who loved me genuinely for... what? The fantasy of you l'd been carrying since college? A woman who doesn't actually exist?"



"I exist," Rose snapped, anger sparking again. "I'm standing right here, fighting for us while you throw away everything we've built because of some old photos,some business mistakes..."



"It's not about the photos!" Stefan's voice rose,startling her into silence. "It's about the pattern they reveal. It's about realizing that the woman I've spent years pining for is a construction. A carefully calculated image designed to get exactly what you want."



"That's not true," she insisted, but the protest sounded hollow even to her own ears.



"Isn't it?" Stefan picked up the society pages from the coffee table, where their engagement photo had once been prominently featured. Now replaced by coverage of her scandals and his company's financial troubles."Tell me something real, Rose. One thing that isn't part of your master plan. One genuine emotion you've ever felt."



She opened her mouth, then closed it again. What could she say that he would believe now? What truth could penetrate the wall of suspicion she'd inadvertently built through years of calculation and control?



"I love you," she said finally, voice small. "That's real."


Stefan studied her face for a long moment. "Maybe you do. In your way. But I don't think your version of love looks anything like mine."


He moved toward the door, picking up the overnight bag he'd packed earlier. The sight sent panic coursing through Rose's veins.



"Where are you going?" she demanded.



"My family's estate. Father thinks we need to present a united front during the company crisis." Stefan's voice was flat, emotionless. "But the truth is, I need space to think. About the business. About us. About who I've become trying to hold onto someone who may never have existed at all."



Rose moved quickly, blocking his path to the door."You can't leave. Not now. Not when both our businesses are under attack. Don't you see? Someone is targeting us. The same person who's going after your company is destroying my brand. We need to stand together."



"Maybe." Stefan gently moved her aside. "But right now, I'm not sure I know who I'd be standing with."



The words cut deeper than any accusation about her past. For years, Rose had maintained perfect control over how others perceived her. Had crafted an image so flawless, so compelling that even her indiscretions were overlooked, her manipulations excused, her calculated moves mistaken for genuine connection.



Now that carefully constructed facade was crumbling,revealing the emptiness beneath. And for the first time in her adult life, Rose felt real fear.



Not fear of financial ruin, though that loomed ever larger with each canceled order. Not fear of social humiliation, though the society pages now painted her as a pariah rather than a darling.



But fear of losing the one person who had wanted her,or at least, the version of her she'd presented,consistently for years. The one person whose devotion she'd counted on as a constant in her calculated rise to power.



"Stefan, please." She abandoned pride, abandoned calculation, abandoned the careful masks she'd worn for so long. "I need you."



He paused at the door, his back to her. For a moment,hope flared in her chest. Then he spoke, voice quiet but firm.



"The problem is, Rose, I don't think you need anyone.Not really. Not in any way that matters."



The door closed behind him with a soft click that somehow hurt more than if he'd slammed it. Rose stood frozen in the entryway, the sound of rain against windows the only noise in the suddenly empty penthouse.


Her phone buzzed on the coffee table, another news alert, no doubt. Another scandal unearthed. Another piece of her carefully constructed life exposed for all to see.



She moved to the window instead, watching Stefan emerge from the building below, overnight bag in hand. Even from this height, she could see the slump of his shoulders, the defeat in his posture as he climbed into the waiting car.


Something tightened in her chest, an unfamiliar ache she couldn't immediately identify. Was this what real pain felt like? Not the calculated shows of emotion she'd performed throughout her life,but genuine loss?


The irony wasn't lost on her. After years of taking what she wanted, of manipulating situations and people to achieve her goals, she might have finally developed genuine feelings for Stefan just in time to lose him.



Lightning flashed again, illuminating her reflection in the glass, designer clothes, perfect makeup, not a hair out of place despite the emotional storm that had just torn through the apartment. The perfect exterior hiding the growing panic beneath.



Her phone buzzed again. This time she picked it up, expecting another media alert about her scandals.


Instead, a new headline made her blood run cold:



"TECH TRILLIONAIRE ALEXANDER PIERCE AND KANE HEIRESS CAMILLE: POWER COUPLE IN THE MAKING?"



Below it, photos from a charity gala showed the notoriously private Alexander Pierce placing a diamond necklace around the neck of Victoria Kane's mysterious adopted daughter. The woman looked radiant, genuinely touched by the gesture.


Rose stared at the image, something nagging at the edges of her consciousness. Something about the woman's profile, about the way she tilted her head slightly as Pierce leaned close.


Something hauntingly familiar that she couldn't quite place.


As she studied the photo, her mind racing to identify the sense of recognition, another alert appeared. Her fashion line's main manufacturing partner had just pulled out of their contract, citing "irreparable brand damage" and "ethical concerns."



The final nail in her professional coffin.



Rose sank onto the sofa, phone still clutched in her hand,the rain lashing the windows matching the storm inside her. Everything she'd built, everything she'd schemed for, everything she'd sacrificed others to achieve, all crumbling around her in a matter of weeks.



And for the first time in her carefully calculated life,Rose Lewis had no contingency plan.
###Chapter 57



Camille's point of view



The afternoon sun warmed my office, casting golden light across the polished mahogany of my desk.I twirled the small blue velvet box between my fingers,savoring the moment before opening it. Alexander's security chief had delivered it personally twenty minutes ago, his professional demeanor never slipping as he handed over both the box and a sealed envelope.


"Mr. Pierce sends his regards, Ms. Kane," was all he'd said before departing.


Now, alone with this unexpected gift, I found myself hesitating. The diamond necklace still rested in my personal safe upstairs, Victoria had reluctantly agreed to delay its return after our PR team's insistence that the publicity was benefiting KCane Industries. This new offering suggested Alexander had no intention of letting our connection fade quietly away.


I opened the envelope first, sliding a finger beneath the seal. The handwritten note inside showed strong,confident strokes, Alexander hadn't delegated this 
task to an assistant.



*For the phoenix who rises higher with each flight These reminded me of your eyes, seeing what others miss, reflecting depths others fear to explore. The necklace was for the world to witness. These are for you alone. Until our paths cross again.-A*


Heat crept up my neck as I read the words twice more.In fifteen months as Camille Kane, I'd received countless professional compliments, careful social flatteries, and calculated business overtures. None had affected me like these few sentences in Alexander's handwriting.



Because none had seemed to see me. Not Victoria's creation. Not the polished heiress. But something beneath all the careful layers, something I sometimes feared had died along with Camille Lewis.


I opened the velvet box slowly. Inside,nestled on white silk, lay a pair of sapphire earrings. Not ostentatious like the diamond necklace, but elegant in their understated beauty. The deep blue stones caught the afternoon light, seeming to glow from within. They perfectly matched the center stone of the necklace he'd placed around my throat at the museum.



These are for you alone.

My fingers touched one earring gently, feeling its weight. Unlike the necklace, which had clearly been chosen for both its dramatic public impact and its business implications, these seemed genuinely personal.Chosen with thought. With care.



Without fully deciding to, I moved to my private bathroom,removing my current earrings and replacing them with Alexander's gift. The sapphires' hung perfectly, their color bringing out something in my eyes I hadn't noticed before. A depth. A spark.



"Ms. Kane?"



Rebecca's voice through the intercom startled me from my reflection. I returned quickly to my desk,pressing the response button.



"Yes?"



"The financial team has completed their analysis of Rodriguez Shipping's vulnerabilities. They're ready whenever you'd like to review the next phase."



Business. Reality. The reason for everything l'd become over the past fifteen months.


"Send them in," I replied, tucking Alexander's note into my desk drawer.


Rebecca entered first, tablet in hand, followed by two members of our financial team. All three stopped short when they saw me, eyes going to the sapphire earrings I'd forgotten to remove in my haste.


"New accessories, Ms. Kane?" Rebecca asked,her professional tone not quite hiding her curiosity.


I touched one earring briefly, then lowered my hand."Just trying something different. The report?"


Rebecca handed me her tablet, but not before l caught the flash of understanding in her eyes. The sapphires weren't public knowledge yet, but Alexander's press statement about the necklace had been released two hours ago. His carefully worded admiration for me had sent Kane Industries stock up another three points and had Victoria pacing her office for thirty straight minutes.



The addition of sapphire earrings would generate another round of speculation when eventually noticed,which Rebecca undoubtedly realized.



"As you can see on page one," our chief financial analyst began, "Rodriguez Shipping's last potential lifeline disappeared yesterday when Eastern Capital Partners declined their emergency funding request."



I scrolled through the report, satisfaction warming my blood as I reviewed the numbers. Stefan's company was now functionally insolvent. Their stock had dropped seventy percent in three weeks. Major clients were terminating contracts daily. Their board was meeting tomorrow to vote on his removal as CEO.


"Their cash reserves?" | asked.



"Depleted," the analyst replied. "They can't make payroll next week without selling assets. The banks have frozen their credit lines pending financial review."



"And the Rose Lewis situation?"



Rebecca took over, swiping to a different section of the report. "Her fashion line is effectively finished.All major retailers have canceled orders. Her manufacturing partners have terminated contracts.Most telling, her biggest financial backer pulled out this morning, citing 'irreparable brand damage.'"


I nodded, feeling the familiar mix of satisfaction and emptiness these reports always brought. Victory, yes.Justice for what they'd done to me. But the hollow feeling afterward grew stronger each time.


"So we're ready for phase three," I said, setting the tablet down.



Rebecca nodded. "The acquisition team is prepared to offer twenty cents on the dollar for Rodriguez Shipping's Asian routes. Given their financial situation,they'll have no choice but to accept whatever we offer." "And for Rose's business?"



"Nothing worth salvaging." Rebecca's assessment was clinical, detached. "The brand is toxic now. Better to let it collapse completely than associate Kane Industries with it in any way."


I stood,moving to the window to hide the conflict I feared might show on my face. Outside, spring had transformed the mansion's gardens, new life emerging after winter's dormancy. Much like I had emerged after my own destruction.



But into what?



"Ms. Kane?" Rebecca's voice pulled me back. "Do we proceed with the Rodriguez acquisition offer?"



The question deserved more consideration than my automatic yes. Acquiring Stefan's shipping routes made good business sense for Kane Industries.Victoria had outlined the strategic benefits months ago,planning for the moment his company would be vulnerable enough for hostile takeover.



But something in me hesitated now. Not from compassion for Stefan, he deserved every bit of the destruction raining down on him. The man who had handed me divorce papers on our anniversary, who had betrayed me with my own sister, deserved to lose everything he valued. No,my hesitation came from a different source. A growing sense that revenge,however sweet,wasn't filling the emptiness inside me the way I'd expected.That systematically destroying Rose and Stefan's lives wasn't healing the wounds they'd inflicted on mine.



Alexander's words from his note floated back to me: The phoenix who rises higher with each flight.


Was this rising? Or was I still circling the same ashes,unable to truly leave them behind?



"Ms. Kane?" Rebecca prompted again, her voice gentle."Your decision?"



I turned back to face them, decision made. "Proceed with the offer, but at thirty cents on the dollar, not twenty."


Surprise flickered across the analysts' faces.Rebecca's expression remained neutral, though I sensed her curiosity at my slight show of mercy.



"May I ask why?" she inquired carefully.



"Because twenty cents would be driven by emotion,by desire to humiliate him completely," I replied,surprising myself with my honesty. "Thirty cents makes better business sense. It's still a brutal lowball offer he can't refuse, but it doesn't make Kane Industries appear predatory to other potential isition targets."


Rebecca nodded, making notes on her tablet. the timing?"





"Tomorrow morning, immediately after their board meeting votes on his removal as CEO. When he's at his most vulnerable."



The team departed with their instructions, leaving me alone once more with thoughts I couldn't quite organize. I removed Alexander's sapphires from my ears, returning them to their velvet box while struggling to understand my own conflicted feelings.


Fifteen months of single-minded focus on destroying Rose and Stefan. Fifteen months of becoming someone new, someone stronger, someone incapable of being hurt the way Camille Lewis had been hurt. All leading to this moment of near-complete victory.



Yet something had shifted inside me. Some perspective I hadn't anticipated.





My phone buzzed with a text from Victoria: *Pierce's press statement has generated another wave of media interest. Our stock is up nearly fifteen percent today.The PR team suggests we consider a joint charitable appearance in the near future.*



The suggestion would have been unthinkable from Victoria three days ago. Alexander's careful chess moves were reshaping the board, influencing even Victoria's strategic calculations.



Before I could respond, another text appeared: *However,I remind you that our primary focus remains the completion of our plan. The Rodriguez acquisition is the priority. Don't allow distractions, however financially beneficial they might appear.*


Distractions. Victoria's code for Alexander and whatever complicated emotions he stirred in me.Emotions that threatened the single-minded focus on revenge she'd cultivated since pulling me from the wreckage of my former life.



I started to type a response, then stopped as my private line rang. The number displayed made my heart beat faster despite my efforts at control.


"Alexander," I answered, keeping my voice neutral despite the flutter in my stomach.



"Sapphires have historically symbolized clarity of thought," he said without greeting. "The ability to see through illusion to truth. They seemed appropriate for a woman standing at a crossroads."



I glanced at the blue velvet box, wondering again how he always seemed to know my mind,my situation,my inner conflicts.



"What crossroads would that be?" | asked.
"The one where you decide if revenge is enough to build a life upon. Or if perhaps something more awaits the phoenix once the fire burns out."



His insight sent a chill down my spine. Had I been so transparent? Had my growing doubts about Victoria's carefully orchestrated revenge somehow become visible to his perceptive eyes?


"The fire is still burning," I said, moving to the window again. "Rose and Stefan aren't quite destroyed yet."



"And when they are? What then for Camille Kane?"


The question echoed my own thoughts so precisely l nearly gasped. "I haven't decided," I admitted,surprising myself with the honesty.


"Perhaps that's the real purpose of the sapphires,"Alexander said, his voice softening slightly. "To help you see beyond the flames to what awaits after."



"And what might that be?"


"That, little phoenix, is something only you can determine." I heard him shift, imagined him standing at his own window in Pierce Tower, looking out over the same city from a different vantage point."Though I would be honored to help you discover possibilities beyond Victoria's carefully scripted revenge." The offer hung between us, loaded with implications neither of us had directly voiced.


"Victoria wouldn't approve," I said finally, knowing it was an understatement.



"Victoria sees only the path she's designed for you.The role she's created. The revenge she's orchestrated." His voice remained gentle but firm."I see the woman beneath all that. The one who rises not just from ashes, but toward something greater."



My free hand touched the sapphire earrings in their velvet box. "You say that as if you know me. The real me."



"Perhaps I do," he replied. "Better than you might expect."


Before I could question this cryptic statement, he continued, "I have a meeting I can't postpone. But consider having dinner with me tomorrow. Seven o'clock. The rooftop at Meridian. No press, no public eyes, just conversation between two people who perhaps understand each other better than the world would ever guess."



The invitation should have been simple to decline.Victoria would expect nothing less. Our careful plan allowed no room for personal connections, especially not with someone as perceptive and unpredictable as Alexander Pierce.



Yet I found myself saying, "I'll consider it," instead of the firm no Victoria had trained me to deliver.



"That's all I ask." I could hear the smile in his voice."Until tomorrow, perhaps."


After hanging up, I returned to my desk,mind spinning with possibilities I hadn't allowed myself to consider before.Tomorrow morning,Stefan would be removed as CEO of his family's company. By afternoon,he would face our insulting acquisition offer for the shipping routes that had been his family's legacy for generations. Rose's fashion empire already lay in ruins,her reputation destroyed, her social standing evaporated.



Victory. Complete and total. Justice for what they had done to Camille Lewis.



But what then? What would remain for Camille Kane once revenge was achieved? Who would I be when hatred no longer defined my purpose?


My finger hovered over Victoria's text, still awaiting response. The path forward she offered was clear,familiar,safe in its controlled precision. The continued execution of our plan. The final destruction of those who had wounded me. The triumph of justice over those who thought themselves beyond consequences. Instead of replying, I opened my desk drawer and removed Alexander's note again. The phoenix who rises higher with each flight.



Maybe there was something beyond revenge.Something beyond the careful script Victoria had written for my reborn life. Something I couldn't yet define but felt drawing me forward nonetheless.


My phone buzzed with another message from Victoria:*Your decision on the Rodriguez offer?*


This time I responded: *Proceeding tomorrow morning at thirty cents on the dollar. More strategically sound than twenty.*



Her reply came immediately: *I agree. Well reasoned.Dinner at seven to discuss final details?*



I stared at the invitation, knowing that accepting would mean refusing Alexander's. Choosing Victoria's path over the undefined possibilities he represented.


The sapphires caught afternoon light, their blue depths seeming to hold questions I wasn't yet ready to answer. Questions about who I was becoming. About what lay beyond revenge. About the woman emerging from the ashes of Camille Lewis who might want more than Victoria's carefully orchestrated justice and revenge My fingers hovered over the keyboard, poised between two futures I couldn't fully see.


###Chapter 58



Stefan stared at the offer letter on his desk until the words blurred together. Thirty cents on the dollar.For shipping routes his grandfather had established. For contracts his father had nurtured. For a legacy three generations of Rodriguez men had built with sweat and sacrifice.



Thirty cents on the dollar. A number designed to wound as much as to acquire.



Behind him, the Rodriguez Shipping headquarters buzzed with the frantic energy of a dying animal.Staff packed personal belongings into cardboard boxes. Security escorted tearful employees to the elevator. Phones rang unanswered throughout the building as news of their financial collapse spread through the industry.



Three hours earlier, the board had voted to remove him as CEO. Only his father's intervention, and their family's controlling shares, had prevented his complete dismissal. Now he clung to the title of "Executive CEO," a meaningless position created solely to spare the family public embarrassment.
"They're waiting for your answer," Eduardo Rodriguez said from the doorway. At sixty-two, his father looked a decade older than he had a month ago. Lines of worry had carved themselves permanently into his face. The proud posture that had intimidated boardrooms for forty years now showed the slight curve of defeat.



"Kane Industries can keep waiting," Stefan replied,crumpling the offer letter in his fist. "I won't sell our Asian routes. Not to them. Not at any price."


Eduardo moved into the office, closing the door behind him. "It's not about pride anymore, son. It's about survival. Without those routes, we lose access to our largest markets. Without the cash from selling them,we can't make payroll next week."


"We'll find another way." Stefan stood, moving to the window that overlooked the harbor where Rodriguez ships had once dominated the skyline. Now only three vessels bore their flag, the rest sold or repossessed in desperate attempts to generate operating capital.


"What other way?" Eduardo's voice held no anger,only exhaustion. "Eastern Capital passed on our loan request. Banks have frozen our credit lines. Suppliers demand payment in advance for fuel and materials."



"We still have friends in this industry. Relationships built over decades."

"Friends?" Eduardo laughed without humor. "Where are these friends now? Henderson Freight signed with Marunouchi yesterday. Pacific Partners canceled our maintenance contract this morning. Everyone's jumping from what they see as a sinking ship."


Stefan pressed his forehead against the cool glass.Below,workers streamed from the Rodriguez building,carrying boxes of personal items, years of service ended with impersonal severance papers and security escorts.



"Someone is behind this," he said quietly. "Someone with resources and motivation to destroy us systematically."



"Does it matter? The result is the same."



Stefan turned to face his father. "It mmatters if we can identify them. Fight back. Expose whatever game they're playing."


Eduardo sank into a visitor chair, suddenly looking every year of his age and more. "This isn't a conspiracy, Stefan. It's business. We overleveraged our Asian expansion. We didn't diversify our client base properly. We missed the technological shift in shipping logistics. Mistakes any company might make,but all together, deadly."


"The timing is too perfect," Stefan insisted. "Every attack precisely when we're most vulnerable. Every blow calculated for maximum damage."



His father studied him with eyes dimmed by fatigue."And who would have both the resources and motivation for such a campaign?"



"I don't know." Stefan moved back to his desk,staring at the crumpled offer from Kane Industries. "But this offer... it feels personal. Deliberately insulting.Designed to humiliate as much as to acquire."



"Victoria Kane is a ruthless businesswoman.Nothing more."



"It's not Victoria." Stefan smoothed the letter,studying the signature at the bottom. Not Victoria's familiar scrawl but a different hand. Elegant, precise,somehow familiar though he couldn't place it. "It's her daughter.Camille Kane."



Eduardo's expression shifted slightly. "The girl who appeared out of nowhere a year ago? The one in the news with Alexander Pierce?"



"Yes." Stefan picked up the tablet on his desk,pulling up a photo from the charity gala where Pierce had placed that diamond necklace around Camille Kane's throat. The image had been everywhere for days, the mysterious heiress and the reclusive tech genius generating endless speculation. "Why would she target us specifically?" Eduardo asked,leaning forward to see the tablet screen.



"I don't know." Stefan studied the woman's face,feeling that strange sense of déjà vu he'd experienced since first seeing her in person at the Metropolitan Museum fundraiser months ago. "But something about her..."



He left the thought unfinished, unable to articulate the nagging feeling that he should recognize Camille Kane.That beneath her perfect exterior lay something,someone, he had encountered before.



"You're grasping at shadows," Eduardo said gently."Looking for conspiracies instead of accepting hard truths."



Perhaps his father was right. Perhaps the systematic destruction of Rodriguez Shipping was simply bad luck,bad timing, bad management decisions coming home to roost all at once. Perhaps the insulting offer from Kane Industries was just smart business, a predator spotting wounded prey.


But Stefan's instincts screamed otherwise. The same instincts that had guided him through countless negotiations, that had warned him of hidden agendas and unspoken motivations across boardroom tables around the world.

 Someone wanted Rodriguez Shipping destroyed.Wanted the Rodriguez family humiliated. Wanted Stefan himself to experience the special pain of watching everything he valued being stripped away piece by piece.


His phone rang, the fourth call in an hour from Rose.He ignored it again, unwilling to deal with her increasingly desperate attempts to reconcile.Her own empire lay in ruins, her fashion line destroyed by scandal, her reputation shredded beyond repair. She needed his support, his resources, his name to rebuild.



But he needed distance. Space to think without her manipulation clouding his judgment. Time to understand what had happened to their lives in such a short,brutal span.



"The Kane offer expires at five," Eduardo reminded him,glancing at his watch. "That's thirty minutes from now."



"Then they'll have their answer in thirty minutes."Stefan straightened his shoulders, decision made."We reject their offer. All of it."


Eduardo's eyes widened. "That's financial suicide.Without that cash infusion..."



"We find another way." Stefan's voice hardened with determination that surprised even him. "This company survived the Depression. Survived two world wars.Survived the 2008 crash. It will survive this too."



"How?"



"I don't know yet." Stefan moved to the credenza where three model ships stood in glass cases, replicas of the first vessels his grandfather had purchased to start Rodriguez Shipping. "But I won't surrender my grandfather's legacy for thirty cents on the dollar. Not to Kane Industries. Not to anyone."



For the first time in weeks, a shadow of pride crossed Eduardo's face. "You sound like him now. Stubborn.Determined. Perhaps a little foolish."



"Foolish enough to start a shipping company during the Great Depression with a single boat and more courage than capital?" Stefan managed a small smile."I'll take that comparison."



Eduardo stood, moving to join his son by the family heirlooms. "If we reject Kane's offer, we'll need to take drastic measures. Sell the headquarters building.Liquidate the pension fund. Possibly even sell our family shares to raise capital."



The suggestions hurt physically - each one removing another piece of what had made Rodriguez Shipping special. What had made it theirs. But Stefan nodded,accepting the harsh reality.


"Whatever it takes," he agreed. "But we do it on our  terms. Not with a gun to our head from Kane Industries."



Eduardo squeezed his shoulder, a silent gesture of support that meant more than words. Then he left the office, posture slightly straighter than when he'd entered, to inform the Kane representatives of their decision.



Alone, Stefan returned to the window, watching darkness fall over the harbor. Lights began appearing on the remaining ships, pinpricks of brightness against the gathering gloom. Like hope in the face of overwhelming odds.


His phone buzzed with a text from the board chairman:*Rejecting the Kane offer is corporate suicide. The board will hold you personally responsible for the consequences.*



Another text followed from the CFO: *Without the Kane money, we default on loans tomorrow.Complete collapse within 72 hours.*


Stefan silenced his phone, turning back to the model ships that represented the beginning of Rodriguez Shipping. His grandfather had started with nothing but determination and a single cargo vessel when everyone said he would fail.


Perhaps it was time to return to those roots. To strip away everything but the core of what had made the company great. To rebuild from foundation rather than try to save a structure that might be too damaged to repair.


His intercom buzzed, his father returning from the meeting with Kane Industries representatives.



"They're gone," Eduardo reported, voice tight with controlled emotion. "Their lead negotiator seemed almost... pleased by our rejection."


"Of course she was," Stefan replied bitterly. "Now they can wait a week and offer fifteen cents instead of thirty."



"Perhaps." Eduardo paused. "But she said something strange as she was leaving. Asked me to give you a personal message."


Stefan's attention sharpened. "What message?"


"She said, 'Tell Mr. Rodriguez that some losses can't be measured in dollars and cents. Some debts can't be paid with anything but complete surrender.'"


The words sent an unexpected chill down Stefan's spine. Not a business communication. A personal one.Confirmation of what he'd suspected, this wasn't just predatory acquisition. This was targeted destruction.


"Did she say anything else?" he asked. "No. Just smiled in a way that..." Eduardo hesitated. "In a way that reminded me of someone, though I can't place who."


The nagging sense of familiarity struck Stefan again.Camille Kane. The mysterious heiress who had appeared from nowhere. Who now seemed determined to destroy Rodriguez Shipping completely.



Who was she really? And why did she seem to hate his family with such personal intensity?



His desk phone rang, the head of HR needing approval for the next round of layoffs. As Stefan took the call, his mind continued turning over the puzzle of Camille Kane. The strange familiarity. The targeted attacks. The message that spoke of debts and surrender rather than business and acquisition.



Something was missing.Some connection he couldn't quite make. Some truth hiding just beyond his grasp.


By the time he finished the call, night had fallen completely. The office building stood nearly empty,most employees already departed, many never to return. Just a skeleton crew remained, those essential to keeping the diminished operation functioning while Stefan sought some miracle to save his family's legacy.



His office door opened again, his father returning with their remaining executive team. Five people where once thirty had filled the boardroom. Five grim faces prepared for the hard decisions ahead.



"The banks are calling their loans tomorrow," the CFO reported without preamble. "We have approximately three million in, liquid assets against thirty-seven million in immediate obligations."



"Options?" Stefan asked, all emotion set aside for the cold mathematics of survival.



"Bankruptcy protection buys us time but destroys client confidence," the legal counsel replied. "Selling hard assets might generate ten million at fire-sale prices. Seeking private equity would mean surrendering control."



The bleak assessment hung in the air like smoke.Stefan studied the faces around him, men and women who had stood by Rodriguez Shipping when others fled. Who believed in the company enough to risk going down with it.



"What about our Pacific Northwest operations?" he asked suddenly. "The routes Kane Industries didn't offer to buy?"



The team exchanged glances, the CFO answering hesitantly. "They're our least profitable division.Aging vessels, thin margins, heavy competition." "But they're debt-free," Stefan pressed. "And not encumbered by the bank loans, correct?"


"Technically, yes." The CFO shuffled through papers,brow furrowed. "They operate under a separate corporate structure for tax purposes."


"Then that's our lifeboat." Stefan moved to the map on his office wall, tapping the Seattle hub that had been the company's first location. "We transfer what liquid assets we can to the Northwest division. Let the banks take the rest. Rebuild from our original home port with the pieces they don't want."



Silence greeted his suggestion, broken finally by the legal counsel. "You're talking about deliberately sacrificing eighty percent of the company to save twenty percent."


"I'm talking about saving what we can rather than losing everything," Stefan corrected. "A strategic retreat, not a surrender."



His father studied him with new respect in his tired eyes. "Your grandfather would approve. He always said sometimes you have to burn the fields to save the farm."



The team began discussing logistics,legal implications,financial arrangements to shield what assets they could before tomorrow's bank reckoning. As they 
worked, Stefan felt something unexpected bloom in his chest, not quite hope, but its determined cousin.The will to fight even when victory seemed impossible.



He wouldn't save Rodriguez Shipping in its current form. Wouldn't preserve the global empire his father had built. But he would save its heart, its original core,the humble beginnings his grandfather had established with nothing but stubborn determination.



And from that seed, he would rebuild. Without Rose's manipulation clouding his judgment. Without his father's expectations weighing on his shoulders.Without the crushing burden of maintaining appearances at any cost.


His phone buzzed with a news alert: "KANE INDUSTRIESANDPIERCETECHNOLOGIES ANNOUNCE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP."



The accompanying photo showed Victoria Kane and Alexander Pierce at a press conference,Camille Kane standing slightly behind them, poised and perfect in a blue dress that matched the sapphire earrings she wore.



Those earrings. Something about them struck Stefan as significant, though he couldn't place why.


Another puzzle piece that didn't quite fit. Another connection hovering just beyond recognition.

His CFO's voice pulled him back to the crisis at hand."If we move quickly, we might save the Seattle operation. But everything else, the Asian routes,the European contracts, the headquarters, all of it will be lost."



"Not lost," Stefan corrected, a new determination hardening his voice. "Surrendered temporarily. There's a difference."



For the first time in weeks, his path forward seemed clear. Not easy. Not guaranteed. But clear.


He would retreat to Seattle, to the company's roots,to the single port where his grandfather had started with nothing but determination and a second-hand cargo ship.
###Chapter 59



Camille's point of view



"They rejected our offer."


Rebecca's words hung in the air between us,impossible, unthinkable. The folder in her hands contained the formal response from Rodriguez Shipping, a single page declining our "generous proposal" with diplomatic language that barely masked the defiance beneath.



"That's not possible," I said, my voice too quiet even to my own ears. "They're broke. Desperate. Days from complete collapse."



"Mr. Rodriguez was quite firm." Rebecca set the folder on my desk, her expression professionally neutral despite delivering news she knew would infuriate me. "Their lead negotiator said the family would rather see the company fail entirely than sell its legacy routes to Kane Industries at thirty cents on the dollar."



Heat rose from my chest to my throat, a burning tide of rage I hadn't felt since the night Stefan had handed me divorce papers on our anniversary. Since the night Rose had smirked at my pain while pretending concern.Since the night I'd walked away from the ruins of a life they'd systematically destroyed.



"Pride," I spat the word like poison. "Always his weakness.His father's too."



I moved to the window, needing space to contain the fury threatening to crack my carefully constructed composure. Outside, spring rain fell on the Kane estate gardens, each drop hitting leaves and petals with precise, relentless rhythm. Like my revenge,patient,methodical, unstoppable.


Until now.



"The financial team has updated projections."Rebecca's voice remained steady, a reminder of the professional facade I needed to maintain. "Rodriguez Shipping will default on their major loans tomorrow.Their credit lines are frozen. They cannot meet payroll next week."


"Then why reject our offer?" I turned back to face her,struggling to understand. "Thirty cents was insulting,yes, but it would have given them operating capital.Time to reorganize. A chance to salvage something."



Rebecca consulted her tablet. "Our analysts suggest it may be a negotiating tactic. Rejecting our first offer to push for better termns."


I shook my head, knowing Stefan better than any analyst ever could. "No. It's principle. Family pride.The Rodriguez name."



Three generations of shipping legacy. The grandfather who'd started with a single vessel during the Depression. The father who'd expanded globally during the shipping boom. And Stefan, who'd inherited it all without understanding the sacrifice behind it.Who'd taken for granted what others had built.



Just as he'd taken me for granted.


"What do they hope to gain?" I asked, more to myself than Rebecca. "They must know they can't survive without selling something."



"Our intelligence suggests they may be consolidating their Northwestern operations." Rebecca scrolled through her notes. "Moving liquid assets to their Seattle division before the banks seize everything else."


A strategic retreat. Smart, actually. Salvaging the one piece of the company structurally protected from the banks' reach. The original hub where Rodriguez Shipping had begun three generations ago.


Starting over from nearly nothing


My fingers curled into fists, nails digging half-moons into my palms. This wasn't how it was supposed to go.Stefan was supposed to surrender completely. Was supposed to experience the total loss of everything he valued. Was supposed to feel the helplessness I'd felt when he destroyed my life without a second thought.

一

"The banks move tomorrow?" | asked.



Rebecca nodded. "First thing in the morning. Our sources say they'll foreclose on outstanding loans and seize all collateralized assets."



"And the board meeting?"



"Emergency session scheduled for nine AM. Likely to accept the chairman's resignation and approve bankruptcy protection filing."


I moved back to my desk, finger tapping against the polished mahogany as I thought. Stefan was slipping through my fingers. Finding a way to survive when he should be experiencing complete destruction.Holding onto a scrap of his family legacy when he should be losing everything.



"Call Matthew Chen at First National," I instructed."Tell him Kane Industries will purchase Rodriguez Shipping's debt at eighty cents on the dollar. All of it,the secured loans, the operating lines, the equipment leases. Everything the banks are holding."
Rebecca's eyes widened slightly, the only indication of her surprise at this unexpected move. "That's over forty million dollars in bad debt, Ms. Kane. The financial team hasn't analyzed...."



"I don't care what it costs," I cut her off, voice sharp with determination. "If Stefan won't sell to us directly,we'll own his debt instead. Every dollar he owes,every asset securing those loans, every piece of paper with the Rodriguez name, I want it allunder Kane Industries control by market open tomorrow."


She made quick notes on her tablet. "And after we acquire the debt?"


"We call it immediately. All of it. No extensions,no refinancing, no mercy." My voice sounded foreign to my own ears, cold and hard in a way I barely recognized. "If he wants to save his precious Seattle operation, he'll have to do it without a penny of operating capital."


Rebecca nodded, professional mask firmly in place despite what must have seemed like irrational business decisions. Spending forty million to acquire bad debt made no financial sense. But this wasn't about finance. It was about justice. About making Stefan feel the complete helplessness I'd experienced when he'd discarded me like yesterday's trash.


"There's one more thing," I added. "The Rodriguez ate. The banks don't hold that mortgage,Sterling Trust does. I want it too."


This time Rebecca couldn't completely hide her shock."The family home? Ms. Kane, that's not a business asset. That's their private residence."



"I know exactly what it is." Three years I'd lived in that mansion as Stefan's wife. Three years of trying to please his family, of attempting to belong in spaces where I was merely tolerated. Three years of memories now tainted by betrayal. "Sterling Trust will sell the note if the offer is generous enough."



"May I ask why? The estate has no strategic value to Kane Industries."





The question deserved a business answer, a rational explanation. Something that would make sense in tomorrow's executive briefing when Victoria questioned this decision.



Instead, I gave the truth. "Because it will hurt him more than losing the company. Because the Rodriguez estate represents five generations of family history. Because it's the one thing Stefan believes can never be taken from him."



Understanding dawned in Rebecca's eyes, not judgment, not concern, just recognition of the personal motivation driving these business decisions.
Victoria had trained her well to accept without questioning.





"I'll make the calls immediately," she said, moving toward the door.





Once Rebecca had gone, I moved to the hidden wall safe behind my office artwork. Inside, nestled beside the diamond necklace Alexander had given me, lay a small photo album, one of the few possessions I'd kept from my life as Camille Lewis. I removed it carefully, opening to the last pages.


My wedding to Stefan. Me in an ivory gown his mother had selected because "white would wash out your complexion, dear." Him handsome in his tuxedo,the smile that had once seemed genuine now revealed as the empty gesture it had always been.



Rose stood beside me in the photos, maid of honor in a dress carefully chosen to outshine the bride. Her arm around my waist, her smile perfect, her eyes already calculating how to take what wasn't hers.


I slammed the album shut, returning it to the safe before the memories could weaken my resolve. This wasn't about pain anymore, wasn't about heartbreak or betrayal. This was about justice. About consequences for actions carelessly taken. About making Stefan understand exactly what he had done when he signed those divorce papers on our anniversary.


My phone buzzed with a text from Victoria: *Heard about the Rodriguez rejection. Your next steps?*



I replied quickly: *Acquiring all debt through bank purchases. Foreclosing immediately. Taking the family estate as well.*



Her response came instantly, approval evident èven in text form: *Excellent. Total control rather than partial acquisition.More thorough destruction.*



I set the phone down, strangely unsettled by her enthusiasm. Once, her approval had been everything I sought. Her strategic guidance the foundation of my reborn existence. Her careful mentoring the framework for my transformation from victim to avenger.



But recently, something had shifted. Some small,persistent voice questioning whether Victoria's vision of justice through complete destruction was truly what I wanted. Whether becoming as cold and calculating as those who had hurt me was really victory at all.



Alexander's words floated back to me: "The phoenix rises not just from ashes, but toward something greater."


I pushed the thought away. Now wasn't the time for doubt. For questioning the path I'd followed for sixteen months. Stefan had rejected the lifeline I'd offered, insulting though it had been. Had chosen family pride over practical survival. Had demonstrated once again the arrogance that had defined our marriage.


My phone buzzed again, Alexander, not accepting my assistant's message as final.


*The phoenix makes her choice. Today revenge,perhaps tomorrow something more. When you're ready to discuss possibilities beyond Victoria's script,I'll be waiting.*



I started to delete the message, then stopped,rereading his words. How did he always seem to know my thoughts? To understand the conflict beneath my carefully maintained exterior?



More importantly, how did he know about Victoria's "script"? About her careful orchestration of my revenge? About the plan we'd developed together over sixteen months of meticulous preparation?



The questions added to my unease, to the growing sense that Alexander Pierce knew far more about me than should be possible. That he somehow saw beyond the surgical alterations and behavioral training to the woman beneath. To the woman I sometimes feared no longer existed.



Tomorrow would bring the next phase of Stefan's destruction. The irrevocable foreclosure on his family's shipping empire. The beginning of the end for the Rodriguez legacy.


But somewhere beneath my fury at his rejection,beneath my determination to make him suffer as I had suffered, a small voice whispered uncomfortable questions.



What happens after revenge is complete? Who will you be when hatred no longer defines your purpose?What rises from ashes when the fire finally burns out?


Questions I pushed aside, focusing instead on the justice tomorrow would bring. On the satisfaction of watching Stefan finally understand what it meant to lose everything that mattered.


On the moment when he would finally pay the debt he owed for destroying Camille Lewis withou a second thought.
###Chapter 60



Morning sunlight cut through Rodriguez Shipping headquarters, harsh and unforgiving. The building felt like a tomb, employees moving like ghosts, their futures evaporating with each passing hour. Stefan stood at his window, throat constricting as he watched the harbor. Last year, a dozen ships bearing his family name had dotted these waters. Now only two remained, forlorn specks against the vast blue that once was his birthright.


The grandfather clock, a family heirloom,ticked mercilessly in the silence. Each sound a heartbeat closer to the end.



Two floors below,Camille Kane sat watching security feeds, her pulse quickening as she found him. Stefan,standing alone, shoulders unnaturally straight despite everything crumbling around him. That damned Rodriguez pride. Her jaw clenched, fingernails digging into her palms as bitterness flooded her veins.



His phone lit up: Eduardo Rodriguez calling again.Four desperate calls already this morning. Overnight,the family estate's mortgage had been sold. Seattle accounts mysteriously frozen. Last-minute financing arrangements collapsed without explanation.


A cold smile spread across Camille's face, savage satisfaction coursing through her. No escape routes.No last-minute rescues. Just methodical, absolute destruction.



Maria appeared in Stefan's doorway, eyes swollen and red-rimmed. Fifteen years of loyalty, about to end in unemployment.



"Mr. Chen from First National Bank is asking to see you," she said, voice breaking. "He says it's urgent."


Stefan nodded. "Send him to the small conference room."



After she left, he straightened his tie with trembling fingers he couldn't quite control. What would his grandfather think? The man who started with one small cargo boat during America's darkest economic times-what would he say about the grandson who lost everything?



Matthew Chen's normally friendly face was now a mask of professional detachment. The handshake between them felt foreign, distant.


"I wanted to speak with you privately," Chen said,pity flickering in his eyes. "Before the official notifications."



Stefan's laugh held only pain. "To soften the blow?
Let me save you the trouble. I know the banks are calling in the loans."


"It's worse." Chen's voice dropped. "The loans weren't foreclosed by banks. They were purchased outright.All of them. By Kane Industries."


The name hit Stefan like a physical blow, driving the air from his lungs. "That's impossible."



"They found a loophole in your financing agreements."Chen slid a document across the table. "As of this morning, every dollar Rodriguez Shipping owes is owned by Kane Industries."



Stefan stared at the elegant cursive signature swimming before his eyes. Not Victoria Kane's signature. Her daughter's. Camille Kane.



"The family estate?" he asked, voice barely audible.



"Also purchased. I'm sorry, Stefan. This isn't standard practice anymore. This is..." Chen hesitated, "personal."


In her hidden room, Camille leaned closer to the screen, pulse hammering in her ears as she watched color drain from Stefan's face. This was the moment she'd dreamed of for so long. The realization dawning that this wasn't just business failure but targeted destruction.



"Victoria Kane?" Stefan asked, confusion etched in the lines of his face. "Why would she target my family?"


Chen shook his head. "All I know is they said it was 'precisely the point' to be unnecessarily destructive."


After Chen left, Stefan sat alone, nausea rising in his throat. His phone buzzed again with his father's name.This time he answered.



"They've taken the house." Eduardo's voice cracked with anguish Stefan had never heard before. "Our home. Five generations. They want us out in thirty days."



"I know." Stefan closed his eyes, chest so tight he could barely breathe. "Kane Industries bought all our debt. Every penny."


"But why? Victoria Kane never showed interest in shipping."



"I don't know," Stefan whispered, "but this feels personal, not just business."



Two floors below,Camille watched Eduardo on screen -the once-powerful patriarch suddenly looking old and broken. Something unexpected twisted in her chest. Eduardo had always been kind to her during her marriage to Stefan. Had defended her when Stefan's mother made cutting remarks. Had treated her with respect his son never showed.She pushed the feeling away, anger rising to drown it out. Eduardo had raised the man who discarded her so easily. Had taught Stefan that Rodriguez men always got what they wanted, consequences be damned.



At five minutes to nine, Stefan entered the boardroom where the remaining executives waited, faces etched with fear, anger, and resignation.


"I won't waste time with false hope," Stefan began,voice steady despite the storm raging inside."Kane Industries has acquired all outstanding Rodriguez Shipping debt and intends to call in these loans immediately."



"That's not possible," Thomas Wagner protested,the oldest board member.


"Then we file for bankruptcy protection," Elena Vasquez suggested.



"They've blocked that avenue too." Stefan's voice remained clinically detached while his world disintegrated. "They've already filed injunctions preventing bankruptcy protection."



In her hidden room, Camille watched their faces as understanding dawned. Not just business failure-absolute destruction. She had expected triumph in this moment,had nurtured this fantasy through sleepless nights. But the hollow feeling in her chest refused to fill with the joy she'd anticipated.



A knock interrupted. Three people entered, led by Rebecca Porter, Camille's assistant.





"Mr. Rodriguez," Rebecca said coolly. "I'm here to deliver formal notification of loan acquisition and immediate demand for payment in full."



"The loans total $157 million dollars," Rebecca continued. "Payment is required within 72 hours or Kane Industries will begin asset liquidation."



"That's more than double our current valuation,"Wagner whispered, the color draining from his face.



"Additionally, as the new holder of your family estate mortgage, Kane Industries is exercising its right to call that loan as well."



The estate. Five generations of Rodriguez history. The final twist of the knife.





"Why?" The question escaped Stefan, raw and desperate. "Why is Kane Industries doing this? We're not competitors."



"Ms. Kane anticipated your request." Rebecca removed an envelope. "She asked me to deliver this personally. For your eyes only."


Stefan took the envelope, his name written in elegant handwriting that stirred something in his memory.The paper felt heavy, like a tombstone in his hands.


After the Kane representatives left, silence descended.The board members looked to Stefan with devastation in their eyes.



"This meeting is adjourned," Stefan said quietly."HR will prepare separation packages. Legal will handle the wind-down procedures." His voice caught.| has been an honor working with each of you."



One by one they filed out, some stopping to shake his hand, others too overwhelmed to manage more than a nod. When the last had gone, Stefan remained alone in the boardroom where generations of Rodriguez men had built an empire now reduced to ashes.



Camille watched him on her screen, her heart thundering against her ribs. This was the moment she'd planned so meticulously. The message that would begin to unravel the mystery for him. That would start him questioning who had destroyed him and why.



Stefan opened the envelope with trembling fingers,removing a single sheet of heavy cream paper. The message was brief:



*Some debts can't be measured in dollars and cents.

Some losses can't be repaid with anything but complete surrender.

Ask yourself what you took that was beyond price.*



Confusion gave way to dread, a cold sweat breaking across his forehead. Not a business communication.A personal one. This wasn't just acquisition. This was targeted revenge.


But for what? Against whom?



His phone buzzed with a news alert: "KANE INDUSTRIES ACQUIRES RODRIGUEZ SHIPPING ASSETS IN HOSTILE TAKEOVER."



The accompanying photo showed Camille Kane touring properties. Something about her profile,about the way she tilted her head slightly, sent an electric shock of recognition through him. A memory trying to surface.


He stared at her image, the elegant woman with the sharp cheekbones and confident stance.Something about her eyes...


Camille watched his face, saw the moment confusion began shifting toward suspicion. Not full understanding yet, the surgical changes to her appearance prevented that. But the first seeds of recognition. Of questions.


Her phone vibrated with Victoria's text: *Is it done?* 
*Yes,* she replied, hands shaking slightly. *Complete financial ruin. He just received my note.*


Victoria's response: *Perfect. The first phase of justice is complete.*



Camille returned her attention to the screen where Stefan sat alone, head in his hands, the carefully maintained facade finally cracking. The sight should have filled her with joy. Should have satisfied the hunger for justice that had defined her existence since the night Stefan had handed her divorce papers on their anniversary.



Instead, watching him break apart in private brought a hollow ache to her chest. This man had destroyed her without remorse. Had discarded her for her sister.He deserved this pain. This loss.



So why did victory taste so bitter?



Stefan suddenly looked up, gaze sweeping the room,pausing at the security camera. For a moment,it felt as though he was looking directly at her.



"Victoria Kane," he whispered, voice raw with confusion. "What did we do to you?"


Yet something in his expression suggested that deep in his mind, something was stirring. Not understanding,not yet. But the faintest echo of recognition,buried too deep for him to grasp.


Camille switched off the tablet, hands unsteady.Her phone buzzed.... Alexander this time.


*The phoenix strikes, but finds the fire burns both ways. When you're ready to discuss what comes after revenge, I'll be waiting.*



How did he always know exactly what she was feeling,when no one else could see beneath her carefully constructed facade?



Camille gathered her things, preparing to slip away unseen. Victoria would be waiting, eager to hear every detail of Stefan's suffering.


But something had changed inside her. Some shift she hadn't anticipated.



Stefan Rodriguez was broken. His company destroyed.His family legacy erased.



Complete victory.



So why did she feel so empty?



As she moved toward the door, Camille caught her reflection, the perfect exterior of Camille Kane,Victoria's heir,avenger.



But beneath that polished surface, something of Camille Lewis remained. Something that whispered uncomfortable questions about what came next.About who she would be when revenge no longer defined her purpose.



Yet as she slipped from the building, his confused question echoed in her mind, haunting her moment of triumph with unexpected doubt.

###Chapter 61


Rose paced her parents' living room, each step calculated to display distress. Tears streaked her makeup, deliberately ruined before her arrival. The afternoon sun highlighted her red eyes and trembling hands as she clutched a disintegrating tissue.


"I don't know what else to do," she sobbed. "Stefan barely talks to me. He sleeps at his family home every night."


Margaret Lewis watched with exhaustion. The past weeks had stripped years from her face, first Camile's death, now Rose's relationship troubles.


"Maybe he just needs time," Margaret suggested weakly. "The Rodriguez company's collapse is a terrible shock."


"Time?" Rose's voice cracked perfectly. "He talks  about canceling the wedding, Mom! Everything we've planned!"


Richard Lewis sat with newspaper forgotten,expression guarded. Since the scandal photos emerged, he'd grown quieter around Rose.


"Stefan's lost everything," he said finally. "His company, his estate, his reputation. Perhaps a wedding isn't his priority."


Rose knelt before her father, grabbing his hands-a rehearsed move that looked spontaneous.


"Daddy, please. I can't lose him. Not after Camille."She pressed her face against his hands. "I can't bear another loss."


Richard stiffened at the mention of Camille, but his fingers curled around Rose's hands.


"What do you expect us to do? Kane Industries bought their debt. The Rodriguez company is finished."


Rose looked up hopefully. "You could invest enough to save the Seattle branch. That's all Stefan needs,just enough to keep that piece alive."


Margaret gasped. "Richard,you can't possibly..."


"It would take millions," Richard interrupted, though he didn't immediately refuse. "For what? A struggling shipping route that's barely profitable?"


"For family, Daddy. Stefan would be family once we're married. Rodriguez and Lewis, joined through us."



She watched her father calculating behind his eyes.


"Even if I wanted to help, Stefan doesn't seem eager to marry you. Why would I invest without guarantee?"


Rose's heart beat faster. This was her opening."Make it a condition. Help save the Seattle branch if Stefan agrees to the wedding. This fall, as planned."


Margaret stood. "Outrageous! You can't buy yourself a husband,Rose!"


"It's not buying," Rose protested. "It'ssaving what matters to both of us. Our future. The company his grandfather built."


"And when he resents you for forcing his hand this way?"


Rose turned, real anger flashing. "Forcing? He loves me! He's always loved me, even when he was with..."She stopped abruptly.


Silence filled the room. Camille's ghost hovered between them.



"Even when he was with Camille," Margaret finished softly. "Is that what you meant?"


Rose looked away. "That's not what I meant."


"Sometimes I wonder if you ever truly mourned your sister at all."



For a moment, genuine emotion broke through,not grief, but fury at being questioned.


"How dare you? I loved Camille more than anyone!I arranged her memorial service. I established the foundation in her name. I'm the one who..."



"Who started dating her husband when she was still married to him? And who announced the relationship to the world after her death?," Margaret saidquietly.


Rose stepped back as if slapped. This wasn't how the conversation was supposed to go.


"That's not fair," she whispered, real tears replacing manufactured ones. "We found comfort in shared grief."



Richard moved between them. "Enough. This isn't helping anyone."



Rose collapsed into her father's arms. "I can't lose him too, Daddy. Sometimes I think about joining Camille, about ending this pain..."


Margaret gasped. "Rose! Don't say such things!"


It was her ultimate manipulation, the suggestion of suicide, implied clearly enough to horrify them.


"We'll figure something out," Richard soothed,
stroking her hair. "No one's going to lose anyone else."



Rose continued sobbing, but inside, triumph bloomed. Her father's resistance was crumbling.


"I just want to be happy," she whispered. "To be Stefan's wife. To give you grandchildren someday."



Rose let her sobs subside, then looked up with swollen eyes. "Will you talk to Stefan? Tell him Lewis Industries can help save what's left of his company?"


Richard exchanged a look with Margaret. "I'll speak with him. But I'm not promising anything yet. I need to see the numbers."



"And the condition?" Margaret asked."That he marry you in exchange for financial rescue?"


Rose straightened her shoulders. "Not that crudely.Just understanding that joining our families would be part of the arrangement. A business marriage."


Richard nodded. "I'll speak with him tomorrow."
As Rose prepared to leave, her mother touched her arm. "Do you truly love Stefan? Beyond his name, his connections, his standing?"


The question caught Rose off guard. Did she love Stefan? Had she ever loved anyone beyond what they could do for her?


"Of course I do," she replied easily. "Why else would I fight so hard?"


Margaret's eyes lingered. "Make sure you're not confusing possession with love, dear. They're not the same thing."


*******



Outside in her car, Rose's facade crumbled. She slammed her hands against the steering wheel,frustrated. Her mother's questions had unsettled her more than she wanted to admit.


"It doesn't matter," she muttered. "As long as Daddy talks to Stefan..."


Her phone buzzed with Stefan's text: *Not coming home tonight. Staying at the office.*


Not "our home" or "the apartment," just "home." As if he was already planning his exit.


Fear gripped Rose. She was losing him, despite everything she'd done, manipulating Camille's marriage, orchestrating opportunities to comfort him when her sister "disappeared," building a narrative of fated love.


And Rose Lewis did not lose. Ever.


She dialed Stefan repeatedly until he finally answered.


"What is it, Rose? I'm busy."


"Daddy's going to help," she blurted. "Lewis Industries can invest in the Seattle branch. Save what's left of the Rodriguez legacy."


A long silence followed.


"And what does your father want in return?"


Rose gripped the phone tighter. "Just family loyalty. The wedding to proceed as planned."


Another silence.


"So that's it. A business transaction. Your father saves my company, I marry his daughter."


"It's not like that..."


"Isn't it?" His bitter laugh cut through. "Tell me, Rose,was any of it ever real?"


Genuine panic welled up in Rose, not grief, not love,but fear of losing her prize.


"All of it," she insisted. "Every moment. I love you,Stefan. I always have, even when...."


"Even when I was married to your sister," he finished flatly.


"So meet with Daddy," she pressed. "Tomorrow.Hear what he's offering."


"And if I refuse? If I'd rather lose my company than marry you this way?"

The question hit like a slap.


"You don't mean that," she whispered. "You're upset.Confused."


"Not as shocked as discovering the woman I loved would try to buy me through her father's money."



"I'm not buying you!" Rose's control slipped. "I'm saving you! Saving us!"


"Tell your father I'll meet him," Stefan said finally."But I'm not promising anything."


He ended the call. Rose stared at the phone, rage and fear battling inside her. Stefan was supposed to be grateful, not disgusted.


"He'll come around," she told herself."Once he sees there's no other way..."


But doubt crept in. What if Stefan refused? What if all her careful planning had been for nothing?


By the time Rose reached her apartment, a new determination had hardened. If Stefan wouldn't willingly accept, she would force his hand directly.


She studied her tear-stained reflection and took photos of herself looking distraught. Then she drafted a message: *I can't do this anymore. Can't keep fighting for someone who doesn't want me.Maybe everyone would be better off if I just disappeared like Camille.*


Her finger hovered over the send button. The message was explicit enough to frighten him, vague enough for deniability later.


But something stopped her. Some voice whispering that this was too far, even for her.


Rose deleted the draft message. Not yet. That card would remain in reserve.



Instead, she removed her makeup, wiping away the deliberate distress. As the tears disappeared,her true face emerged, calculated, controlled,determined.



Her phone buzzed with a message from her father: *Arranged meeting with Rodriguez tomorrow, 10 AM.Numbers look workable if structured as joint venture.*



Rose smiled at her reflection, triumph replacing doubt. Her father was already preparing the financial rescue.


Stefan would resist. His pride was wounded, his truust shaken. But men like him were predictable. Family legacy mattered more than personal feelings. The Rodriguez name would ultimately outweigh his doubts about her methods.



And if not... Rose glanced at her phone,remembering the deleted message. There were always other ways to ensure compliance. Other buttons to push.


"Game on, Stefan," she whispered. "Let's see how much your pride is really worth."
###Chapter 62



The charity auction for the Children's Medical Research Foundation had transformed the Westmore Hotel's grand ballroom into a glittering showcase of wealth. Crystal chandeliers cast golden light over Manhattan's elite as they mingled with champagne flutes in hand.



Camille stood near the silent auction display,maintaining the practiced smile Victoria had taught her. Her midnight blue gown and Alexander's diamond necklace completed the image of Camille Kane, heiress to the Kane fortune. To everyone watching, she appeared perfectly at ease.


Inside, her nerves twisted like live wires. The event coordinator had just informed her that Richard and Margaret Lewis had arrived, her parents, though they had no idea their "dead" daughter stood in the same room.


"Ms. Kane," Rebecca murmured, appearing at her side. "They've been seated at table twelve, directly across from the stage. Would you prefer to move your placement?"


Camille sipped champagne, buying seconds to compose herself. "No. Victoria would want me to remain as planned."



"Victoria would want you to avoid unnecessary risks,"Rebecca countered.



"Perhaps. But Victoria isn't here."


Rebecca nodded. "I'll stay close, just in case."


As her assistant moved away, Camille allowed her gaze to drift across the room, finding her parents.The sight hit harder than expected. Nineteen months since she'd last seen them, the night she'd confronted Rose about Stefan.


Her mother looked older, shadows beneath her eyes that makeup couldn't conceal. Her father stood straight-backed as always, but new lines marked his face.Was it grief that had aged them? Or Rose's scandals?


A waiter passed with champagne. Camille exchanged her empty glass for a full one, steadying her trembling hands. She should move away. Should minimize the risk of direct interaction. Should protect the revenge plan she and Victoria had executed so meticulously.


Instead, she drifted closer, drawn by something stronger than caution. Not love, that emotion had burned away months ago. Not forgiveness, that was beyond her now. Perhaps simply curiosity about what had become of the people who had once been her world.


She hadn't counted on her mother's uncanny ability to sense when someone was watching. Before Camille could retreat, Margaret turned, eyes sweeping the crowd before settling directly on her.Their gazes locked across the ballroom.


No recognition showed in Margaret's face, only polite interest. But as Camille held her stare a heartbeat too long,something shifted in her mother's expression. A slight furrowing of her brow. A tilt of her head. The look of someone encountering a puzzle.


Camille turned away first, pulse racing. Too much risk. She moved toward a display of artwork,pretending absorption in a landscape painting she barely saw.


"Beautiful brushwork," a voice observed beside her."The artist captures light in a way that reminds me of Turner."



Camille's blood froze. Her mother's voice. So achingly familiar. She turned slowly, face composed in a mask of polite interest.


"You have a good eye," she replied, amazed at how steady her voice remained.


Margaret Lewis stood closer than Camille had realized, elegant in a navy dress that brought out her blue eyes, eyes that had once looked at Camille with love, then disappointment, then grief. 
"Margaret Lewis," her mother introduced herself,extending a hand. "I don't believe we've met, though you look remarkably familiar."


Camille accepted the handshake, the brief contact sending lightning through her body.


"Camille Kane," she responded, the name strange on her tongue when speaking to someone who had once known her by another name entirely.


"Ah! I've seen your photos in the business journals.You've made quite an impression since your public debut."



Camille smiled, Victoria's coaching allowing her to maintain the conversation while emotional earthquakes shook her internal landscape. "I've had excellent guidance."


"Your mother is certainly a force of nature. My husband and I have admired her business acumen for years, though we've never had the pleasure of working directly with Kane Industries,"
The mention drew Camille's gaze past her mother's shoulder. Richard Lewis was watching them,expression unreadable from this distance.


"Perhaps that will change in the future," Camille said carefully. "Kane Industries is always seeking new partnerships."


Margaret tilted her head slightly, that puzzled look returning. "Forgive me for saying so, but you remind me of someone. I can't quite place who."


Danger. Victoria's voice echoed in her memory:"If anyone from your past life shows unusual interest or mentions similarity, end the interaction immediately."


But some reckless part of her couldn't resist pushing further.


"I've been told I have one of those faces," Camille said lightly."Familiar without being recognizable."


"No, it's more specific than that." Margaret studied Camille's features. "Something about your expressions. The way you tilt your head when listening. It's quite striking."


Camille's heart pounded loudly. Dr. Torres had changed her appearance, sharpened cheekbones,refined her nose, altered her jawline, but no surgeon could change the mannerisms engrained since childhood.



"Love." Richard Lewis appeared beside his wife."The Hendersons are looking for us."


His eyes met Camille's briefly, recognition completely absent. The man who had taught her to ride a bike,who had checked her homework, who had walked her dòwn the aisle, looked at her as if she were a perfect stranger.


It cut deeply.


"Richard Lewis," he introduced himself with a quick handshake. "I see you've met my wife."


"Ms. Kane is Victoria Kane's daughter," Margaret explained,still studying Camille. "The one everyone's been talking about." "Ah, of course. Your work with the TechVault acquisition was impressive. Quite a debut into the corporate world."


"Thank you," Camille responded,grateful for the shift to professional territory. "Though much of the credit belongs to the team behind the scenes."


"Modest as well as accomplished," Margaret observed with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes."A rare combination these days."



Something in her mother's tone raised warning flags.That wasn't social pleasantry, it was assessment.Margaret might not recognize her daughter, but something about Camille Kane had triggered her curiosity.


Rebecca materialized at Camille's side. "Ms. Kane,Mr. Harrington is asking about your bid on the Wyeth painting.He seems quite determined to outbid you."


A perfect exit. Camille turned to her parents with her practiced smile. "Duty calls. It was a pleasure meeting you both."
"The pleasure was ours," Richard replied automatically, already scanning the room.


But Margaret caught Camille's arm lightly. The unexpected contact sent a shock through Camille's system, how many times had her mother reached for her exactly this way?


"I hope we'll have a chance to speak again,"Margaret said quietly. "Perhaps at the Metropolitan Museum gala next month? I believe Kane Industries usually sponsors a table."


Not social politeness but a deliberate attempt to establish another meeting. Another opportunity to solve the puzzle Camille represented.



"Perhaps," she managed, withdrawing her arm."Though my schedule stays rather unpredictable."


Margaret nodded, apparently satisfied. "Until next time,then."


As Camille walked away, she felt her mother's gaze following her. Rebecca kept pace beside her, murmuring low.



"That was dangerous. Victoria would not have approved."


"Victoria isn't here," Camnille repeated, though her earlier confidence had faltered. "And sometimes risks yield valuable information."



"What information did you gain besides confirming they don't recognize you?"


"My mother senses something. Not recognition,exactly. More like... familiarity she can't place."


"All the more reason to avoid further contact,"Rebecca pointed out. "If she begins asking questions..."


"She already has questions," Camille interrupted."The question is what she'll do with them."


The evening continued, Camille performing her role flawlessly, bidding on auction items, making small talk with business contacts, donating an additional fifty thousand dollars. Throughout it all, she maintained awareness of her parents, careful to keep adequate distance.


They left early, her father checking his watch with familiar impatience. As they made their way toward the exit, Camille saw her mother pause, turning to scan the room one last time. Their eyes met briefly across the crowd.


Margaret offered a small, puzzled smile before allowing her husband to guide her out. That smile, so familiar, so maternal despite the absence of recognition, sent unexpected pain through Camille's chest.



"Are you alright?" Rebecca asked, noticing the momentary slip in Camille's expression.


"Fine," Camille replied automatically. "Just tired."


Later, in her private car, Camille finally allowed herself to process the emotions she'd carefully contained.Seeing her parents up close. Hearing their voices. Speaking with them as a stranger while memories of a shared lifetime echoed in her mind. It should have felt triumphant, standing before them as Camille Kane, wealthy and powerfuI.They hadn't recognized the daughter they'd sacrificed for Rose's happiness. Hadn't seen past the surgical alterations to the woman who had once been their younger child.



Instead, she felt hollow. Empty in a way that Victoria's coaching hadn't prepared her for.


Her phone buzzed with a text from Alexander: *|heard the Lewis family attended tonight. Are you okay?*



How did he always know? How did he always sense exactly what was happening beneath her controlled exterior?



*Fine,* she texted back, the lie automatic. Then,surprising herself: *No. Not really.*


His response came immediately: *Sometimes the most painful wounds are the ones that don't bleed.I'm here if you need to talk.* Camille stared at the message, throat tight with emotions she'd thought safely buried. Her parents hadn't recognized her. Had spoken with her, and seen only Camille Kane, Victoria's mysterious daughter, a business connection worth cultivating.Not the child they'd raised.



It should have hurt less than Stefan's destruction or Rose's betrayal. They were her parents, but they'd made their choice long ago, chosen the daughter who played their social games perfectly over the one who neverquite fit their expectations.



So why did this cut so deeply? Why did her mother's puzzled almost-recognition hurt more than if she'd shown no interest at all?



The car approached Victoria's mansion, security lights illuminating the manicured grounds. Inside the massive entry hall, silence greeted her. Victoria was in Tokyo. The house staff had retired. For the first time in months, Camille found herself truly alone with her thoughts. She moved to the study, pouring herself a measure of expensive scotch. The familiar burn helped steady her nerves as she sank into a leather chair,kicking off her heels with relief.



Victoria would be furious about tonight's interaction.Would see it as an unnecessary risk to their carefully constructed narrative. To the revenge plan they'd executed with precision.


But something about seeing her parents about her mother's puzzled scrutiny had awakened questions Camille had buried. What was she really achieving with this elaborate revenge? Was destroying Stefan's compàny and Rose's reputation truly healing the wounds they'd inflicted? Or was she simply creating new scars to layer over the old ones?


Her phone buzzed again. Alexander: *Sometimes returning to who we were means facing those who knew us then. It doesn't mean you're weak. It means you're human.*


Camille set down her glass, his words touching something raw inside her. Victoria had trained her to be perfect, untouchable, a weapon of precise destruction. Alexander seemed to see the human beneath, the woman still capable of being wounded by a mother's puzzled gaze.


She scrolled through her phone to the secret album she rarely viewed. Photos from before, Camille Lewis smiling with highschool friends. Camille Lewis on her wedding day. Camille Lewis with her parents at her highschool graduation, their arms around her shoulders, pride evident in their expressions.


A family that no longer existed. Parents who now chatted politely with the stranger their daughter had become.



Margaret's words echoed: "You remind me of someone. I can't quite place who."


What would happen if her mother did place it? If she looked at Camille Kane one day and suddenly saw Camille Lewis beneath the surgical alterations?Would there be joy at discovering her daughter lived?Hurt at the deception? 
Camille closed the photo album. Tonight had opened doors better left shut, awakened questions she wasn't ready to answer. Victoria would say she was losing focus, allowing sentiment to cloud their revenge strategy.


Perhaps she was right.


But as Camille moved through the silent mansion toward her suite, she couldn't shake the image of her mother's puzzled expression. The feeling that somewhere, buried beneath years of manipulation and favoritism, some essential connection remained,some maternal instinct that recognized something familiar in a stranger's face.



In her bathroom, Camille removed her makeup,studying her transformed features in the mirror. Dr.Torres had done masterful work, the changes subtle enough to appear natural while significant enough to create a new identity.


And yet...


As she removed the last traces of mascara, Camille could almost see Camille Lewis peering through Camille Kane's eyes. The woman she'd been still lived somewhere inside the woman she'd become.


She pulled out her phone again, staring at Alexander's message. He alone seemed to understand the war raging beneath her carefully maintained facade.


*You were right,* she texted finally. *Facing the past is harder than l expected.*


His response came immediately: *The phoenix rises from ashes, but first it must acknowledge what burned. Sleep well, Camille. Tomorrow brings new choices.*



As she slipped into bed, Camille wondered what choices tomorrow might bring. Whether the glimpse of her parents would strengthen her resolve for revenge or weaken it. Whether her mother's puzzled recognition would deepen into tue understanding.


And what she would do if Margaret Lewis looked at her someday and said the words that would shatter everything: "Camille? Is it really you?"


Sleep claimed her before she found an answer,dreams filling with her mother's searching eyes and the whispered question that followed her into darkness: "Why do I know you?"
###Chapter 63


Camille's point of view



The morning sun filled my home office,bathing the pristine white furniture in golden light that should have been soothing. Instead, I stared at my tablet screen, my chest so tight I could barely breathe.The headline of the Wall Street Journal's business section screamed at me in bold black letters:



**LEWIS INDUSTRIES TO RESCUE RODRIGUEZ SHIPPING WITH $100M INVESTMENT**


The subheading twisted the knife deeper:


**Wedding Bells to Follow: Rodriguez-Lewis Union Cements Business Partnership**


My coffee cup crashed to the floor as I stood abruptly, hot liquid splattering across imported marble tiles. I didn't care. The words on the screen burned through my mind, erasing months of careful planning, of systematic destruction, of what should have been complete victory.


"NO,"1I whispered, my voice trembling with emotion l rarely allowed myself anymore."No,no,NO!"


I scrolled through the article, each paragraph feeding the fire growing inside me:


*In a surprising turn of events, Lewis Industries has announced a $100 million investment in Rodriguez Shipping's Seattle operations, rescuing the century-old family business from complete collapse following Kane Industries' recent debt acquisition.*



*Sources close to both families confirm that the business alliance will be strengthened by personal ties, with an October wedding planned between Stefan Rodriguez and Rose Lewis, sister of the late Camille Lewis-Rodriguez.*


*"This partnership represents not just a business opportunity, but the joining of two family legacies," Richard Lewis stated in this morning's press conference. "Sometimes tragedy can lead to unexpected new beginnings."*


The tablet flew from my hands before I realized I'd thrown it, shattering against the far wall in a spray of glass and electronics. The destruction wasn't enough. Nothing could quiet the storm raging inside me.



After everything I'd done. After buying his company's debt. After taking his family home. After systematically destroying everything the Rodriguez name stood for.


Stefan was still choosing Rose. Still moving forward with the life they'd planned while I was supposedly dead at the bottom of that river.


And my parents - MY PARENTS - were funding it all.


My intercom buzzed, Rebecca's voice careful and measured: "Ms. Kane? I assume you've seen the news. Victoria is on the secure line." I forced myself to take three deep breaths before responding. "Send the call through."


Victoria's face appeared on my wall screen, her expression controlled but fury evident in the tightness around her eyes. She was in her Tokyo hotel suite, the skyline visible behind her through floor-to-ceiling windows.


"This is unacceptable," she said without greeting."All our careful work, undone by a simple investment deal."



"They can't do this," I replied, pacing the length of my office."We own the debt. We control the assets.How can Lewis Industries possibly..."


"They're not buying the company," Victoria interrupted. "They're creating a new entity, using the few assets we couldn't touch, primarily the Seattle operations we thought were too worthless to bother with. Your father has found a legal workaround that keeps the Rodriguez name alive, if significantly diminished." The word "father" sent fresh pain shooting through me. Richard Lewis was funding the revival of Stefan's business, cementing Rose's triumph, all while having no idea he was destroying his supposedly dead daughter's carefully executed revenge.


"The wedding announcement wasn't coincidental,"Victoria continued, her analytical mind already dissecting the strategy. "It's a deliberate message to investors and clients, a statement of confidence in the new venture. The Rodriguez-Lewis union creates stability, continuity, tradition."


"I want it stopped." My voice came out harder than I'd ever heard it. "All of it. The investment. The business aliance. The wedding. I want it all burned to the ground."


Victoria studied me through the screen, her gaze softening slightly, a rare glimpse of the maternal concern she typically kept hidden beneath her formidable exterior. "This is why l've always cautioned against emotional involvement in business matters. You're taking this personally." "Of course I'm taking it personally!" I slammed my hand against my desk, welcoming the physical pain."It IS personal. It's MY revenge they're unraveling.MY justice being denied."


"Your revenge isn't complete," Victoria said calmly."This is merely an unexpected development requiing tactical adjustment."



"Tactical adjustment?" I laughed, the sound sharp and bitter even to my own ears. "They're getting MARRIED, Victoria. With my parents' blessing and financial support. After everything they did to me.After everything we've done to destroy them."


"And they will still pay. Perhaps more completely than before." Victoria leaned closer to the camera, her expression intensifying. "This development presents new opportunities. They're rebuilding, investing emotions and resources into a future they believe is secure. When we destroy that future, the pain will be magnified considerably."


Her logic should have calmed me. Should have helped me see past the raw hurt to the strategic implications. Instead, I felt something crack inside,some final piece of the woman I'd once been breaking away.


"I feel like everything wNe've done was for nothing," I said, collapsing back into my chair. "They still win in the end."


Victoria's expression shifted, calculation replacing concern. "Perhaps we've been too... indirect in our approach." A small, dangerous smile curved her lips."We need to create a scandal that will completely destroy your sister Rose."


I looked up sharply. "What kind of scandal?"


"The kind that would make your parents reconsider their support. The kind that would make Stefan question his choice." Victoria tapped her fingers against her desk, a habit I knew indicated she was carefully considering her next words.


My breath caught. "That is a good plan"

 
"Recently, I acquired proof and witnesses of all of Rose scandals" Victoria's expression was unreadable. "I held it in reserve, uncertain if such a personal attack would serve our larger goals. But now..."



"Now it's exactly what we need," I finished, a cold clarity replacing the emotional turmoil I'd felt moments before. "Evidence that Rose is not a saint."



"Show me," I demanded, leaning toward the screen."Show me what you have."


"When I return tomorrow. This isn't something to discuss over even our most secure channels."Victoria's expression softened again, nearly imperceptible but there for those who knew how to read her. "For now, maintain appearances. The charity luncheon at the Botanical Gardens is still on your schedule for today."


"I'm not in the mood for smiling at socialites."


"Nevertheless, you will attend." Victoria's tone brooked no argument, maternal authority overlaying business command. "Now more than ever, Camille Kane must appear unaffected by Rodriguez-Lewis affairs. Any reaction could raise questions we don't want asked."


After ending the call, I showered and dressed mechanically,donning a pale blue suit that Rebecca had selected for the luncheon. My outward appearance perfectly matched what was expected of Victoria Kane's heir, polished, professional,poised.


Inside, I was burning.


My car was waiting when I descended the mansion's grand staircase. James stood by the open door, his expression professionally blank as always.


"The Botanical Gardens, Ms. Kane?"


"No," I decided suddenly. "Take me to the Rodriguez estate first."



James hesitated, unusual for him. "Ms. Kane, the property is no longer..."


"I know it's no longer in Rodriguez hands. I know we own it. I just... need to see it."
He nodded, closing my door before sliding into the driver's seat. As the car wound through exclusive neighborhoods where Manhattan's elite maintained their family compounds, I stared out the window without really seeing the passing scenery.


The Rodriguez estate had been in their family for five generations. I'd lived there for three years as Stefan's wife, trying desperately to fit into spaces that had never truly welcomed me. Now it stood empty, another asset in Kane Industries' portfolio,another piece of the Rodriguez legacy stripped away.


Except now Stefan was rebuilding that legacy. With Rose by his side. With my parents' money and blessing.


The car slowed as we approached the private road leading to the estate. James paused at the security gate, showing identification to the guard Victoria had stationed there.



"We're just driving past," he explained. "Ms. Kane wanted to view the property." The guard nodded, raising the barrier to allow us through.


The driveway curved through manicured grounds,revealing the mansion gradually as we approached.Colonial architecture, white columns, windows gleaming in the morning sunlight. It looked exactly as I remembered from my years living there, except for the stillness. No staff moving about the grounds. No cars in the circular drive. Just empty perfection,preserved like a museum exhibit.


"Stop here," I instructed as we reached the front of the house.



"Would you like to go inside, Ms. Kane? I have the access codes."


"No." I wasn't ready for that, wasn't sure l'd ever be ready to walk through rooms filled with memories of my failed marriage. "This is close enough."①


Through the car window, I studied the home that had never truly felt like mine despite my best efforts.Stefan's mother had made sure of that, with her constant remarks about traditions I didn't understand and standards | couldn't quite meet. Even the furniture had belonged to previous Rodriguez wives,selected and arranged generations before I arrived.


Rose would fit perfectly here. Would know exactly how to play the role of Rodriguez wife, just as she'd always excelled at being the perfect Lewis daughter.


The thought sent fresh pain spiraling through me.


"They're not moving back here," I said aloud,decision crystallizing as I spoke. "Even if the new business succeeds. Even if the wedding proceeds.They will never live in this house again."


James met my eyes in the rearview mirror. "What would you like done with the property, Ms.Kane?"



I considered the question, looking at the grand house that represented everything the Rodriguez name stood for, tradition, wealth, unbroken lineage.


"Sell it," I said finally. "Not to another family. To developers. I want it torn down, the land divided into 
smaller lots."


James nodded, making a note on his phone. He didn't question the decision that would erase a historic property, didn't comment on the destructiveness of the order. Victoria hired people who followed instructions without judgment.


"Now the Botanical Gardens," I said, turning away as we pulled back down the driveway. "I have a charity luncheon to attend."
###Chapter 64


Camille's point of view


For the next three hours, I performed flawlessly.Smiled at the right people. Made appropriate small talk. Donated a generous sum when the fundraising total was announced. No one looking at Camille Kane would have suspected the emotional turmoil beneath her composed exterior.



No one except Alexander Pierce, who appeared at my elbow as I waited for my car afterward.


"You're not as good at hiding your feelings as you think," he said quietly, falling into step beside me.


"I don't know what you're talking about."


"The Rodriguez-Lewis announcement." He studied my profile as we walked. "It wasn't part of your plan."

I stopped, turning to face him fully. "How do you always know? What's happening in my life, what I'm feeling, how do you always seem to be one step ahead?"



Instead of answering, he offered his arm. "Walk with me. The gardens are beautiful this time of year."


Against my better judgment, I accepted, allowing him to guide me along a stone path that wound through flowering shrubs and carefully tended beds.


"I had a sister once, she is not my biological sister but my nanny's daughter who i took like a kid sister,"Alexander said after several minutes of silence."Younger. Brilliant. Full of life and promise."


The unexpected personal revelation caught me off guard.Alexander Pierce rarely spoke about himself,his past a carefully guarded mystery despite his public business success.


"What happened to her?" I asked, curiosity momentarily displacing my own troubles.
"She married a man who seemed perfect.Handsome. Wealthy. Well-connected." His voice remained casual, but I felt tension in thearm linked with mine. "He was also controlling. Manipulative.Eventually abusive, though she hid it well."


We reached a secluded bench overlooking a pond.Alexander guided me to sit, then took the space beside me, close but not touching.


"When she finally tried to leave him, his family closed ranks. Used their connections to freeze her assets.Threatened to destroy her professionally if she went public with abuse allegations. Offered a settlemnent that amounted to pennies compared to what she was entitled to."



The story resonated uncomfortably with my own experience, not the abuse, but the sense of powerful families protecting their own, of money and influence used as weapons.


"What did she do?" | asked softly.


Alexander's eyes fixed on the distant water. "She took the settlement. Started over. Built her own success, piece by careful piece." His mnouth curved in what might have been pride. "She's running a tech company in California now. Happy.Free."


"You helped her."


"Every way I could." He turned to look at me directly,his gaze more intense than usual. "I understand the need for justice, Camille. The hunger to make those who hurt you pay for what they've done."


The simple acknowledgment of my feelings unlocked something inside me. With Victoria, emotional reactions always had to be channeled into strategic advantage. Alexander simply accepted the raw hurt driving my actions.


"They're getting everything they wanted," I said, the words spilling out before I could contain them."The business alliance. The society wedding.My parents'blessing. It's like I never existed at all."


"You exist." Alexander's hand covered mine on the bench between us. "More powerfully than they could possibly imagine."


"But they don't know that!" The frustraton that had been building all day finally broke through. "They think they've won. Think they've overcome every obstacle I put in their path. Rose gets to wear white and promise forever to my Ex-husband while my parents watch proudly from the front row."


"And what would change if they knew?" Alexander asked gently. "If Victoria revealed Rose's secrets tomorrow,what would truly change?"



The question stopped me short. I'd been so focused on the idea of revelation, of seeing their faces when they realized who had been orchestrating their destruction, that I hadn't thought beyond that moment.


"Stefan might still choose Rose," Alexander continued when I didn't answer. "Your parents might find ways to justify their support. The question isn't just what secrets Victoria has discovered, but how to use them for maximum effect."
"So I just watch them celebrate? Let them build this future together while I hide in the shadows?"


"No." Alexander's voice hardened slightly. "You use every advantage Victoria Kane's daughter possesses to ensure that future never materializes. Not through obvious attacksthey can defend against, but through subtle maneuvers they won't see coming until it's too late."



His understanding of my situation, of the complex emotions driving me, was uncanny.


"Why do you care?" | asked suddenly. "About me.About my revenge. Why involve yourself in this at all?"


Alexander was silent for a long moment, his expression unreadable. "Let's just say | recognize someone fighting their way back from destruction.Someone refusing to let others define their story."


It wasn't a complete answer, but something in his tone warned against pressing further. Besides, my phone was vibrating with a message from Victoria: *Seattle property records pulled. New venture filing discovered. Wedding details being compiled. Return tomorrow 0800. Prepare for complete strategic overhaul.*



I slipped the phone back into my pocket, a calm certainty replacing the earlier chaos of my emotions.Victoria had never failed me, not since the day she'd found me clinging to life and offered me a path to rebirth. Whatever secrets she'd uncovered about Rose, whatever plan she was formulating, I trusted it would be devastating.


"I should go," I said, rising from the bench. "Victoria returns tomorrow. We have plans to make."



Alexander stood, studying my face with an intensity that should have been uncomfortable but somehow wasn't. "Whatever you're planning, be careful. Some victories come at costs you can't anticipate."


"I've already lost everything once," I replied, meeting his gaze steadily. "There's nothing left they can take from me."

His expression suggested he disagreed, but he merely offered his arm again to escort me back to the main path. As we walked, I found myself wondering what Alexander Pierce really wanted, why this successful, enigmatic man had inserted himself into my life at precisely the moment everything threatened to unravel.


For now, though, I had more pressing concerns. Rose and Stefan had celebrated prematurely. Whatever happiness they'd found would be short-lived.
###Chapter 65


The breakfast tray sat untouched on Rose's nightstand, fresh fruit and pastries growing stale in the morning air. She hadn't moved from the edge of her bed for nearly an hour, eyes fixed on the television screen where her life was unraveling in high definition.


"Fashion designer Rose Lewis faces new allegations today," the entertainment reporter said, her expression a mask of professional concern that barely concealed her delight in the scandal. "Former associates have come forward with evidence that Lewis engaged in multiple affairs during her European apprenticeship, including relationships with married industry leaders who later promoted her work."



Rose's fingers dug into her silk comforter until her knuckles turned white. This wasn't happening. Not now. Not when everything was finally coming together.


The reporter continued, her voice dripping with false sympathy. "Most damaging are claims from British fashion executive Jonathan Hayes, who alleges Lewis used their affair to gain industry access while simultaneously pursuing a relationship with his business partner."


The screen filled with Jonathan's face, older now,silver threading through the dark hair she remembered running her fingers through in London hotel rooms. His expression held no remorse as he detailed their relationship to the waiting cameras.


"She was calculating even then," he said, eyes meeting the camera directly. "Everything was transactional. An affair for introductions. Intimacy for opportunities."


Rose grabbed the remote, hurling it at the screen with a scream of frustration. It bounced harmlessly off the glass, the reporter's voice continuing uninterrupted.


"These allegations come at a particularly sensitive time for Lewis, whose fashion line has been struggling with production delays and canceled orders from major retailers."


The doorbell rang, its cheerful chime a jarring contrast to the destruction playing out on the screen.Rose ignored it, pulling her knees to her chest as more evidence of her past appeared in professionally edited segments.


Lord Hartley, silver-haired and aristocratic, seated in his country estate library: "She made me believe l was special, that our connection was unique. Later l discovered she was seeing my colleague simultaneously, leveraging both relationships for fashion world introductions."


The former assistant to Anton Bessonov, her eyes hard with old resentment: "She lived on his yacht while his wife believed she was attending design conferences. When international authorities began investigating Mr. Bessonov's finances, she disappeared overnight."


Photos flashed across the screen, Rose entering hotels with different men, Rose boarding the infamous yacht in Monaco, Rose at industry events on the arm of designers three times her age. Each image more damning than the last, each time-stamped to create a comprehensive timeline of calculated ambition.


The doorbell rang again, more insistent this time.Rose buried her face in her hands, tears streaming between her fingers. How had they found these people? Who had convinced them to speak after all these years? She'd been so careful, had paid for silence when necessary, had created a narrative of dedicated apprenticeship that everyone had accepted without question.


Until now.


Her phone buzzed with messages from her publicist,her lawyer, her business manager, all demanding to speak with her, all wanting direction on how to handle the crisis. Rose ignored them all, her eyes returning to the television where her carefully constructedlife continued to disintegrate.


"Former classmates from Lewis's fashion program have also come forward," the reporter was saying,clearly enjoying each new revelation. "They allege systematic theft of design concepts that later appeared in Lewis's breakthrough collection."


A photo appeared, Rose's award-winning graduation piece juxtaposed with a nearly identical sketch from a classmate's portfolio, dated months earlier. Side by side, the theft was unmistakable, the minor alterations insufficient to hide the original source.


"No, no, NO!" Rose screamed, grabbing a crystal vase from her nightstand and hurling it against the wall. The glass shattered, water and flowers spraying across imported wallpaper. The destruction wasn't enough to ease the panic rising in her chest.


The reporter was now discussing financial connections between Rose and Anton Bessonov,suggesting that her early design collections had been funded through questionable sources.
"Banking records obtained exclusively by our investigative team show substantial deposits to Lewis's accounts during her time with Bessonov," the woman explained as graphics appeared on screen."These deposits moved through several shell companies before reaching her, a pattern financial experts describe as consistent with money laundering techniques."


The doorbell rang a third time, followed by heavy knocking. Rose pulled herself from the bed on unsteady legs, moving to the window to peer through the blinds. Reporters. At least a dozen of them crowded her building's entrance, cameras ready,faces eager for a glimpse of the fallen fashion darling.



Her phone rang again, her publicist for thefifth time.Rose finally answered, her voice tight with barely controlled fury.


"What the hell is happening, Melissa? How did they get all this? Who's behind it?"
"I don't know," her publicist replied, professional calm cracking under pressure. "It's coordinated,that's all I can tell you. Multiple outlets receiving the same evidence simultaneously. Former associates contacted by someone offering significant money for exclusive interviews. It's... it's unprecedented."


"Make it stop!" Rose demanded, pacing her bedroom like a caged animal. "That's what I pay you for!"


"It's too late for containment. We need to issue a statement immediately. Something addressing the allegations directly while...."


"No! Absolutely not!" Rose cut her off. "We deny everything. Every single thing. Call it a smear campaign by jealous competitors."


"Rose, there are photos. Time-stamped,authenticated photos. There are bank records. There are multiple credible witnesses all telling consistent stories. Denial will make this worse."


Rose swept her arm across her vanity, sending perfume bottles and makeup crashing to the floor."| don't care! Find out who's behind this. Someone orchestrated it. Someone with resources and connections.I want to know who!"


The knocking on her door grew louder. Rose ended the call,moving to the entry and peering through the peephole. Her assistant, Michael, stood there looking terrified.


"Ms. Lewis, please, I need to speak with you." His voice carried through the door, high with anxiety."Vogue just pulled your feature completely. Neiman Marcus is invoking the morality clause in their contract. Your main fabric supplier in Italy just canceled all pending orders."


Rose yanked the door open, pulling Michael inside before slamming it shut again. "Tell me something I don't know!"



He flinched at her tone but continued. "Your investors are calling an emergency meeting this afternoon. The bank froze your business accounts pending review of the money laundering allegations."
"They can't do that!" Rose grabbed his arm, fingers digging in hard enough to make him wince. "That's my money! My business!"


"The freeze is temporary, but... with the production timeline for your fall collection..." Michael trailed off,not needing to finish the thought. Without access to funds, without fabric suppliers, without retail partners, the collection was effectively dead.


Rose released him, moving back to the window where the crowd of reporters had grown. Someone must have tipped them off that she was home.The thought sent fresh rage coursing through her.


"Who did this?" she whispered, more to herself than Michael. "Who has enough power to coordinate something this comprehensive?"


"I don't know, but there's something else." Michael held out his tablet, displaying another news site."They're reporting that an anonymous source provided evidence that some of your early designs weren't original. That you... appropriated them from other designers who never received credit."
Rose snatched the tablet, scanning the article with growing horror. There, displayed side by side, were sketches from her most celebrated collections alongside nearly identical drawings from other designers' portfolios, designers who had worked with her, mentored her, trusted her with their creative process.


"These are lies," she hissed, throwing the tablet onto the sofa. "Distortions. Similar designs happen in fashion all the time. It's called inspiration!"


Michael looked unconvinced but knew better than to contradict her directly. "What do you want me to do?The press is demanding a statement."


Rose paced the length of her penthouse, mind racing through options, through damage control scenarios,through ways to salvage what remained of her reputation and business. Someone had orchestrated this takedown with surgical precision, timing each revelation for maximum impact.


"Find me a list of enemies," she said suddenly,turning to face her assistant. "Everyone I've crossed in the industry. Everyone who might have resources to do this.Everyone who might want to destroy me."


"That... might be a long list," Michael said carefully.


Rose moved to her dressing room, scanning her clothing options with frantic energy. If she had to face this storm, she would at least look impeccable doing it.


"Tell him to focus on the coordinated nature of the attacks. Make it clear this is a deliberate takedown by unnamed competitors threatened by my success.Deny any financial impropriety completely. For the affairs, say my private life is my business and has no bearing on my professional contributions."



"And the design theft allegations?"


Rose yanked a crimson dress from its hanger, the color perfect for projecting confidence and defiance."Similar aesthetic sensibilities are common in creative industries. I was influenced by many designers, as they were by me. I categorically deny stealing anyone's work."
As she dressed, applied fresh makeup, and prepared to face the media circus outside her building, Rose's mind continued turning over possibilities. Who had the reach to find people from her London and Paris days? Who had the connections to access banking records from a decade ago? Who had the patience to compile this evidence slowly, methodically, waiting for the perfect moment to destroy her?


The answer remained elusive, but the question burned with obsessive intensity. Someone had declared war on Rose Lewis. Someone with resources and motivation she couldn't identify.Someone who knew exactly where to find her weakest points, her buried secrets, her carefully hidden past.



"Your car is waiting at the service entrance," Michael reported, ending a call with building security."They've cleared a path, but there are still reporters.Do you want to make a statement or go straight to your lawyer's office?"


Rose checked her reflection one final time, smoothing her hair and straightening her shoulders.The woman in the mirror looked nothing like the panicked, raging figure who had been throwing objects minutes earlier. She looked composed,confident,defiant.


It was the greatest performance of her career.①


"No statement yet," she decided. "Let them speculate. Let them wonder. I won't give them the satisfaction of seeing me break."


As she gathered her purse and phone, another alert appeared on Michael's tablet. He tried to shield the screen, but Rose caught the headline: "EXCLUSIVE:Rose Lewis's Former Mentor Reveals Pattern of Deception,Manipulation."


Her mentor. Eliza Winterbourne. The woman who had taught her not just design but strategy. The woman who had trusted her completely. The woman whose private collection of vintage couture Rose had carefully photographed and replicated without permission. "I want a full report on who's talking by this afternoon," Rose instructed Michael, her voice glacial with suppressed fury. "Every name. Every allegation.Every connection between them. Someone orchestrated this, and I will find out who."


In the elevator descending to the service level, Rose caught her reflection in the polished metal doors.The perfect image of success she'd cultivated so carefully, showing nothing of the ruins beneath.


As the doors opened and she prepared to face the waiting cameras, a single question burned through the shock and rage: who had the power and motivation to destroy her so completely? Who had compiled evidence buried for years, coordinated revelations from people across continents, timed everything for maximum damage?


The answer waited somewhere beyond the flashbulbs and shouted questions. And Rose Lewis would find it, even if she had to burn what remained of her world to the ground in the process.

###Chapter 66



Camille's point of view


I stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows in Victoria's penthouse office, watching the city lights flicker to life as dusk settled over Manhattan. Rain tapped against the glass, a gentle percussion accompanying the victory drumming through my blood.


On six massive screens behind Victoria's desk,Rose's destruction played out in real-time. Every major news channel, every entertainment show,every social media feed, all consumed with the spectacular downfall of fashion's rising star.


"More champagne?" Victoria asked, appearing at my side with the bottle of Dom Pérignon we'd opened when the first reports broke this morning. Her smile,rare and genuine, made her look younger.
"Please," I said, holding out my crystal flute.


Victoria clinked her glass against mine. "To justice,"she said, voice warm with satisfaction. "Long overdue."



"To justice," I echoed, turning back to the spectacle on the screens.


A reporter stood outside Rose's apartment building,rain dampening her hair as she struggled to maintain her professional demeanor despite the obvious joy in delivering the news.


"Fashion designer Rose Lewis remained inside her penthouse apartment all day as more allegations surfaced about affairs with married men, stolen designs, and questionable financial ties to figures under investigation for money laundering. Sources close to Lewis say she is 'devastated' by what her legal team is calling a 'coordinated character assassination."


I couldn't help but laugh. "Devastated. I wonder if that's how she described me to Stefan when they were planning my replacement."


Victoria squeezed my shoulder. "This is only the beginning.By tomorrow, every major retailer will have canceled their orders. By next week, her investors will pull out completely. By next month, Rose Lewis will be nothing but a cautionary tale."


The satisfaction I felt should have been pure and sweet. This was what we'd worked toward for nearly two years, the systematic destruction of the woman who had stolen my husband, my life, my identity. The woman who had orchestrated my "Attack," leaving me for dead. This was justice, served cold and precise.



So why did victory taste so complex? Why did the champagne feel both sweet and slightly bitter?


On the center screen, footage played of Rose leaving her building through a service entrance, head high,crimson dress a slash of defiance against the gray day.Even in her downfall, she performed the role of wronged innocent perfectly.
"Look at her," I said, unable to keep the bitterness from my voice. "Still playing to the cameras. Still manipulating perceptions."


Victoria moved to her desk, pressing a button that muted the screens. "That performance won't save her.Not this time."


I turned away from the windows, studying the woman who had rescued me, rebuilt me, guided me through the transformation from broken victim to powerful avenger.


"How did you find them all?" I asked, settling into a leather chair facing her desk. "Jonathan Hayes, Lord Hartley, Anton Bessonov's assistant... they all disappeared from her life years ago."



Victoria's smile turned almost predatory. "Money opens many doors, but information is the true currency of revenge. For nearly one years, I've had investigators tracking down everyone Rose ever used, betrayed, or discarded. Most were eager to talk once they understood they weren't alone."
"And the banking records? The evidence of money laundering?"


"More challenging, but nothing is truly hidden from those who know where to look." Victoria studied me over her glass. "You're troubled. Why? This is what we've worked toward."



I sighed, frustrated by my own complicated emotions. "I should feel only happiness seeing her suffer. Only satisfaction watching her world crumble.But there's something else... something I can't quite name."



Victoria leaned forward, her expression turning serious. "Don't confuse justice with vengeance,Camille.What we've done isn't about making you feel better. It's about balance. About consequences for actions.About ensuring Rose Lewis finally faces the truth of who she is."



"I know," I said, standing to pace. "But part of me expected to feel... more. Some profound sense of closure or healing."

"Healing doesn't come from what happens to others," Victoria said quietly. "It comes from what happens within you. Rose's destruction is simply/the external manifestation of justice. Your healing is a separate journey."


Her words settled over me, wisdom I hadn't expected from a woman whose focus had always been strategic rather than emotional. Perhaps there were depths to Victoria Kane I still hadn't fully discovered.


My phone buzzed. Alexander's name appeared on the screen, sending an unexpected flutter through my chest.


*The lioness watches her prey fall. Satisfaction or emptiness? Perhaps both. Call when you're ready to discuss what comes after revenge.*


How did he always know my mind so precisely?slipped the phone back into my pocket without responding, not ready to examine what Alexander Pierce represented in my life.


Victoria watched me with that penetrating gaze.
"Alexander?"



I nodded, not bothering to deny it.


"He remains a complication," she observed,her tone neutral but her eyes sharp. "A variable we didn't account for in our planning."



"He's not a threat to what we've accomplished," I said, more defensively than intended.


"Perhaps not. But his interest in you goes beyond business. He wants something from you, Camille.Something he hasn't yet revealed."


Victoria pressed another button, switching the largest screen to a financial news channel. The analyst was discussing the impact of Rose's scandal on the fashion industry, specifically how several designers' stock prices had jumped as retailers looked to fill the gap left by her toxic brand.


"We should consider acquiring her manufacturer in Milan," Victoria said. "With their contracts canceled,they'll be desperate. We could get their facilities and workforce for pennies on the dollar."


The suggestion was perfect Victoria, seeing opportunity in destruction. Yet something in me resisted.



"Let someone else have it," I said, surprising both of us. "We've taken enough."


Victoria's eyebrows rose slightly. "That's...unexpected. I thought you wanted complete dismantling of everything she built."


"| did. I do." I struggled to articulate my shifting emotions. "But there's something about picking through the remains that feels...beneath us."


A small smile played at Victoria's lips. "Us. Not me.Us. You've truly become a Kane."


The observation should have pleased me. For months, becoming Victoria Kane's daughter had been my focus, my purpose, my new identity. Yet something about it now felt constricting, as if the perfect vengeance we'd achieved had opened space for questions I hadn't allowed myself to ask before.


Who was I, when not defined by revenge? What would drive me, when Rose and Stefan had been thoroughly destroyed? What filled the void when hatred no longer consumed every thought?


Victoria joined me by the windows again, her reflection appearing beside mine in the darkened glass.


"You're evolving," she said, her voice gentler than usual. "That's natural. For months, every decision has been filtered through the lens of justice for what they did to you. Now that justice is being served,you're at a crossroads."


"What comes next?" I asked, the question directed partly at her, partly at myself.


"That depends entirely on you." Victoria turned to face me directly. "When I found you half-dead on that garage, I offered you a choice, disappear into a new life somewhere far away, or rise from the ashes transformed. You chose transformation. Now you face another choice."


"Which is?"



"Whether Camille Kane exists only as an instrument of revenge, or as someone with a future beyond it."


Her words struck deep, touching uncertainties I'd been avoiding since our plan began yielding results.Since the single-minded focus on destruction began making room for other possibilities.


"I don't know who I am without this," I admitted,gesturing toward the screens. "Without the goal of making them pay."


Victoria studied me, her gaze thoughtful rather than calculating. "Perhaps that's the next ###Chapter of your journey. Discovering Camille Kane beyond revenge.Beyond the past. Beyond even my careful molding."


The suggestion surprised me. Victoria had always been directive, strategic, clear about who I should become.This open-ended possibility, this freedom to define myself beyond our shared purpose, was unexpected.


"You would support that?" | asked carefully. "Even if it meant choices you didn't plan for?"


Something flickered in Victoria's eyes, an emotion l couldn't identify. "I saved you, Camille. Rebuilt you.Gave you the tools to achieve justice. But I never intended to own you."


She moved back to her desk, picking up a thick folder I hadn't noticed earlier. "Which brings me to something I've been considering."


I followed her, curiosity momentarily displacing my existential questions. Victoria handed me the folder,its weight substantial.


"What is this?"



"Open it," she said simply.


Inside were legal documents. I flipped through them,understanding dawning slowly.


"You're giving me controlling interest in Kane Industries' Tech division," I said, looking up in shock."Thirty percent ownership. Board chairmanship.Final approval on all acquisitions."


Victoria nodded. "Consider it your graduation present. You've learned everything I can teach you about business, strategy, and power. Now it's time for you to build something of your own."


I stared at the documents, their implications staggering. This wasn't just a gift, it was independence. Authority. Identity beyond being Victoria Kane's creation or Rose Lewis's destruction.



"Why now?"


"Because revenge is ending," Victoria said simply."And your life needs to be beginning. Rose Lewis built her career stealing from others. I want you to build yours creating something uniquely yours."


Emotion tightened my throat, unexpected gratitude mixing with something like awe. For all her calculated coldness, Victoria Kane had given me more than tools for revenge. She had given me a future. "Thank you," I said, the words inadequate for the gift she was offering.


Victoria waved away my gratitude. "Don't thank me.Show me what you'll build. Show me who Camille Kane becomes when not defined by her past."


My phone buzzed again. Another message from Alexander: *Dinner tomorrow? Something to celebrate your victory, and perhaps discuss what comes after.*



This time, I found myself smiling as | typed: *Yes.8pm. You choose the place.*


Victoria noticed, of course. "Alexander Pierce represents a choice too," she observed. "One I hope you'll make with your eyes fully open."


"Meaning?"


"Meaning he has his own agenda, as everyone does.Including me." Victoria's honesty was refreshing and slightly alarming. "Just be certain you understand what you're choosing before you choose it."On the screens, a new headline scrolled: "DESIGNER ROSE LEWIS: FORMER EMPLOYEES ALLEGE TOXIC WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT." The destruction continued its inexorable march, gathering momentum without requiring our further intervention.


"I believe I'll understand mny choices better now," I said, looking at the documents in my hands. "Now that I have something to look forward to, not just something to avenge."


Victoria raised her champagne glass. "To the future,then. And to the woman you're becoming."


"To the future," I echoed, clinking my glass against hers.



As night settled over Manhattan, the city lights blazed against the darkness. I studied my reflection in the window, Camille Kane looking back at me,Victoria's creation but increasingly my own as well.The surgical alterations, the careful training, the strategic positioning had transformed me physically and socially. But something else was happening now,something neither Victoria nor I had fully anticipated.

I was transforming internally too. Becoming someone neither Camille Lewis nor Victoria's carefully crafted heir,but someone new. Someone undefined by either past trauma or present revenge.


My phone buzzed one final time. Alexander again:*Looking forward to tomorrow. The phoenix rises not just from ashes, but toward something greater.*


For the first time since the Rose's men had nearly claimed my life, I found myself genuinely curious about what that "something greater" might be.

###Chapter 67


Stefan Rodriguez stared into his whiskey glass,watching the amber liquid catch the dim bar light.This was his fourth drink of the night, or maybe his fifth. He'd lost count somewhere between the endless news alerts about Rose's scandal and the memories that wouldn't stop haunting him.


The bar was nearly empty on this rainy Tuesday night. Just him, the tired-looking bartender who had stopped trying to make conversation hours ago, and a couple in the far corner who seemed too wrapped up in each other to notice anything else. Perfect. The last thing Stefan wanted right now was recognition,questions, or worse, pity.


He took another long swallow, letting the burn travel down his throat. The television above the bar played footage of Rose leaving her apartment building, surrounded by reporters shouting questions about her affairs, her stolen designs, her connections to questionable money. The sound was muted, but Stefan could almost hear her practiced denials, her careful performance of wronged innocence.


"Turn that off," he muttered to the bartender, who glanced up at the screen and reached for the remote without comment.


The sudden silence felt heavier somehow. Without the distraction of Rose's public disgrace, Stefan was left alone with thoughts that had been circling his mind for days. How had he been so blind? So easily manipulated? So completely fooled by a woman whose entire existence, it seemed, was built on calculation and lies?


The bartender set another whiskey in front of him without being asked. "On the house," he said,his eyes reflecting something that might have been understanding. "You look like you need it."


Stefan nodded his thanks, too exhausted for words.

The past week had hollowed him out. First the collapse of his family's shipping empire, then the discovery of Rose's deception, and now this public spectacle of her unraveling life. He should feel vindicated seeing her carefully constructed image crumble. Instead, he felt only a bone-deep weariness that no amount of alcohol seemed to touch.


His phone buzzed on the bar top. His father, again.The third call tonight. Stefan silenced it without answering. What could he possibly say to the man whose legacy he had failed to protect? Whose family name now stood tarnished by association with Rose Lewis?


The small Rodriguez Shipping operation in Seattle was still functioning, but barely. The employees who had remained loyal deserved better than a broken man drowning his failures in whiskey. They deserved a leader with focus, with drive, with some plan for rebuilding from the ashes.


Stefan ran a hand through his disheveled hair,remembering when he had been that man. When he had believed himself worthy of the Rodriguez name.

 When he had thought himself in love with a woman who turned out to be a stranger.


No, not a stranger. A predator.


The emails the investigator had uncovered had revealed the truth with brutal clarity. Rose wasn't a kind and good woman. She had been plotting,manipulating, calculating for years. The calls from London. The "chance" encounters when she returned to New York. The perfectly timed comfort offered when his marriage to Camille had struggled.


All deliberate. All strategic. All focused on achieving what she wanted, regardless of who suffered in the process.


Including Camille.


Stefan closed his eyes as memories of his wife flooded back. Camille, with her gentle smile and quiet determination. Camille, who had loved him despite his flaws, despite his family's cold welcome,despite the distance he had placed between them as Rose's influence grew.Camille, whose car had gone off that bridge two nights after he had asked for a divorce. The night after he had chosen Rose.


The guilt was a physical pain in his chest, sharper than any business failure, any public humiliation. The knowledge that he had thrown away something genuine for a carefully crafted illusion felt like swallowing broken glass.


"You okay, buddy?" the bartender asked, pausing in his task of wiping down glasses.


Stefan opened his eyes, surprised to find his vision blurred. "Fine," he managed. "Just... thinking."


"Dangerous activity after midnight," the bartender said, not unkindly. "Especially with that much whiskey involved."


Stefan attempted a smile that felt more like a grimace. "Some thoughts follow you no matter how much you drink."


The bartender nodded knowingly. "Those are the ones worth listening to,usually."


The simple wisdom hit harder than it should have.Stefan had spent nearly two years not listening to his thoughts, not about his failing marriage, not about Rose's convenient timing, not about the business decisions that had left Rodriguez Shipping vulnerable to hostile takeover. He had silenced every warning,ignored every red flag, dismissed every instinct that might have saved him from where he sat now.


His phone buzzed again, not a call this time, but a news alert. Stefan knew he should ignore it, spare himself whatever fresh humiliation the media had uncovered about Rose or their relationship. But some masochistic impulse made him pick up the device and check the notification.


"ROSE LEWIS SCANDAL DEEPENS: FORMER CLASSMATE PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF DESIGN THEFT"


Accompanying the headline was a photo of Rose from her fashion school days, standing proudly beside what had been her breakthrough design, a design that, according to the article, had been stolen from a fellow student who never received credit.


Stefan scrolled through the story, a strange numbness spreading through him. Every new revelation about Rose should have shocked him,but instead, each one simply confirmed what he now understood. The woman he had believed himself in love with, the woman he had been prepared to marry,had never actually existed. She had been a character played by a skilled manipulator who saw people as stepping stones to what she wanted.


And what was most disturbing wasn't how thoroughly she had fooled him, but how easily he had allowed himself to be fooled.


When had he become this man? This gullible, shallow person who had discarded a genuine wife for the flashier, more calculated attention of her sister?When had ambition and appearance begun to matter more than substance and truth?


The questions burned through the alcohol haze,demanding answers he wasn't ready to face.
Stefan signaled for another drink, needing to dull the sharp edges of his self-recrimination. The bartender hesitated, clearly weighing his professional responsibility against the desperation in Stefan's eyes.


"Last one," he said firmly, pouring a smaller measure than before. "Then I'm calling you a car."


Stefan didn't argue. He had lost the right to make good decisions for himself somewhere between signing divorce papers on his anniversary and watching Kane Industries systematically dismantle his family company.


Kane Industries. The name triggered something in his foggy mind. A connection he had been trying to make for days now. Victoria Kane had no history in shipping, no previous interest in Rodriguez Shipping assets. Yet her company had moved with surgical precision to acquire their debt, seize their assets,and block every attempt at recovery.


Why? What had prompted such targeted destruction?
And more puzzling was her daughter, Camille Kane.The mysterious heiress who had appeared less than two years ago, with no background information beyond vague references to a European education.The woman whose dark eyes had seemed almost familiar when they had briefly met at that charity function months ago.


There was something there, some connection he couldn't quite grasp through the whiskey fog. Some explanation for why Kane Industries had singled out Rodriguez Shipping for such complete destruction.


"Time to go, Mr. Rodriguez."


Stefan looked up, surprised to find the bartender standing before him with his coat. The bar was empty now, the couple in the corner long gone, the night pressing dark against the windows.


"What time is it?" Stefan asked, voice rough from whiskey and silence.


"Nearly two. And you've had enough."Stefan nodded, not trusting himself to stand without assistance. The bartender's steady hand helped him to his feet, guided him into his coat, and steered him toward the door.


"Your car's outside. Already paid for."


"Thanks," Stefan managed, fumbling in his pocket for his wallet. "Let me...."


"It's covered." The bartender waved away his attempt to pay. "Someone called. Said to put it on their account."


Stefan frowned, confused."Who?"


"Didn't say. Just that you shouldn't be driving."


The mystery benefactor was probably his father, still monitoring him despite being ignored all evening.The thought should have annoyed him, but instead, it simply added to the weight of failure pressing down on his shoulders. Even now, Eduardo Rodriguez was taking care of problems his son couldn't handle alone. Outside, rain fell steadily, turning the city streets into rivers of reflected light. A black town car waited at the curb, driver standing patiently beside the open rear door. Not his father's usual service, Stefan noted distantly. Something more expensive. More discreet.


"Mr. Rodriguez," the driver said with a slight nod."Where can I take you tonight?"


Stefan hesitated. Not back to the empty penthouse he had shared with Rose, still filled with her things despite her hasty departure days ago. Not to the family estate that now belonged to Kane Industries.Not to the Seattle offices where his presence wvould only remind everyone of how far the mighty Rodriguez Shipping had fallen.


"Just... drive," he said finally, sliding into the car's leather interior."Anywhere."


The driver nodded again, closing the door and returning to the wheel without further questions.The car pulled smoothly into the rain-slicked street,wipers creating a hypnotic rhythm against the windshield. Stefan leaned back against the seat, letting exhaustion and alcohol pull him toward unconsciousness. The car moved smoothly through nearly empty streets, wipers still keeping their steady beat.Stefan felt consciousness slipping away despite his attempt to understand the strange events of recent weeks.


As sleep finally claimed him, his mind still wrestled with unanswered questions. Why had Kane Industries targeted him so precisely? What had triggered such a thorough destruction of everything he valued? And why did he still feel there was something important he was missing, some connection just beyond his grasp?


The car continued its journey through the rain-washed city, carrying its unconscious passenger toward a destination neither of them yet knew.

###Chapter 68


The executive boardroom of Kane Industries buzzed with restrained energy as financial analysts and legal experts gathered around the massive oak table. All eyes focused on the presentation screen where Fabio Moretti's company logo, Moretti Global Logistics, dominated the display.


Victoria Kane sat at the head of the table, silver hair swept into her signature severe bun. To her right,Camille Kane studied the financiaI projections,occasionally making notes on her tablet.


"Mr. Howard, please begin," Victoria said, nodding to the head of acquisitions.


Daniel Howard cleared his throat. "Moretti Global Logistics is the primary shipping partner for Rose Lewis Designs, or what remains of it. They handle eighty-seven percent of the brand's global transportation needs, plus warehousing and fulfillment."


He clicked to the next slide showing a world map dotted with distribution centers. "Moretti has built impressive infrastructure across twenty-three countries, specializing in high-end fashion logistics.Their client list includes Chanel, Versace, and numerous luxury brands."


"And their financial situation?" Victoria prompted.


"Overleveraged," Howard replied, advancing to a declining profit graph. "They expanded aggressively last year, taking on significant debt. With Lewis Designs' collapse, they've lost thirty percent of expected revenue. Their stock has dropped eighteen percent in the past week alone."


Victoria turned to legal. "Ms. Chen, the ownership structure?"


Eleanor Chen opened her folder. "Fifty-one percent owned by Fabio Moretti himself. Twenty-two percent public shareholders. The remaining twenty-seven percent held by various private investors, including a fifteen percent stake belonging to Rose Lewis, who joined their board last year."


A murmur ran through the room. Victoria silenced it with a glance before turning to her daughter.


"Camille,your assessment?"


All eyes shifted to the younger Kane, who set down her tablet with deliberate care.



"Moretti Global represents a strategic opportunity on multiple levels," Camille began coolly. "First, their infrastructure complements our existing holdings.Second, their client relationships give us immediate entry into luxury fashion shipping. Third, their vulnerability makes this the optimal moment to acquire them below market value."



She paused, meeting her mother's gaze. "And fourth,Fabio Moretti is Rose Lewis's godfather and most loyal business ally. The last person still standing beside her."
The significance settled over the room. Everyone understood this wasn't purely business. This was personal, another calculated move in the systematic dismantling of Rose Lewis's world.


"Thank you, Camille," Victoria said. "Mr. Howard, the takeover strategy?"


Howard clicked to a flowchart. "We've prepared a two-pronged approach. First, quietly acquire available public shares through subsidiaries.Simultaneously, approach private investors,excluding Ms. Lewis, with offers fifteen percent above current value."


"And Moretti himself?" Victoria asked.


"That's where we'll face resistance," Howard admitted. "He's known for loyalty. His connection to the Lewis family goes back decades. He's unlikely to sell willingly."


Victoria turned to research. "Dr. Patel, what vulnerabilities have you identified?"

 Dr. Patel touched her tablet, bringing new information to the screen.


"Fabio Moretti has three pressure points. First, his son Marco's struggling startup has been kept afloat through his father's cash infusions. Second, Moretti Global's expansion into South America encountered regulatory issues that could be reopened. Third, his youngest daughter is launching a fashion brand next season and needs manufacturing and distribution partners."



"Excellent," Victoria said. "Leverage without anything too aggressive."


"Implementation timeline?" she asked Howard.


"We could have controlling interest within thirty days."


Victoria shook her head. "Too slow. Rose Lewis resigned yesterday. The embezzlement evidence becomes public tomorrow. Moretti will be preparing contingency plans. We need to move faster." She turned to Chen. "Legal implications of an immediate tender offer?"


"We'd pay a premium and telegraph our intentions,but there's no legal obstacle."


Victoria nodded. "Prepare the offer at twenty percent above current value, contingent on acceptance within forty-eight hours."


She looked around the table. "Any other considerations?"


Camille spoke. "Fabio Moretti has been a second father figure to Rose since childhood. Taking his company will hit her differently than other business losses. This is personal for her."


Victoria studied her daughter. "Does that concern you?"


"No," Camille replied steadily. "Just an observation.We should prepare for a more emotional response than her previous losses triggered."


Victoria stood. "I want the tender offer ready by market close. And ensure Ms. Lewis's stake is completely isolated in the new structure. I want her investment rendered worthless."



The executives filed out, leaving Victoria and Camille alone.


"You're quiet," Victoria observed. "Having second thoughts?"


Camille shook her head. "No. Just appreciating the precision of it all. How each piece fits so perfectly into the larger strategy."


Victoria smiled slightly. "Like chess. The key is thinking multiple moves ahead while your opponent is still reacting to your last action."


"And Rose Lewis is definitely reacting now," Camille said with satisfaction. "Her public statement yesterday was a disaster. All that talk about 'industry norms' made her sound completely unrepentant."


"As expected," Victoria replied. "Rose Lewis has never taken responsibility for anything in her life." Camille gazed out at the city. "After Moretti Global,what's left? What else does she have to lose?"



Victoria joined her at the window. "Her penthouse.Her investments. The remaining shreds of her social standing. But those are merely material losses. The real victory comes when she finally understands."


"Understands what?"



"That someone deliberately orchestrated her destruction. That it wasn't bad luck or media bias.That someone with patience, resources, and intimate knowledge of her weaknesses methodically took everything she valued."


"And when will we reveal that someone was us?"


Victoria smiled with genuine pleasure. "When it will hurt the most. When she has nothing left but questions about who destroyed her and why."


The intercom buzzed. "Ms. Kane, Mr. Moretti is on line one. He's asking about unusual trading activity in his company's stock."

Victoria and Camille exchanged glances, showing slight surprise.


"Tel him I'll speak with him shortly," Victoria replied.


"He suspects already," Camille observed. "That complicates things."


Victoria shook her head. "It accelerates things.Suspicion creates anxiety. Anxiety leads to poor decisions."



"You want him to panic," Camille realized admiringly.


"Fear makes the simplest solution more attractive,"Victoria confirmed. "In this case, accepting our offer before he fully understands our intentions."


They moved to Victoria's office for the call. As Victoria settled behind her desk, Camille took the chair beside her.


"Remember," Victoria said, "this is business. Not personal. At least as far as Fabio Moretti knows."


Camille composed her features as Victoria initiated the video call. Fabio Moretti appeared, a distinguished Italian man in his sixties with worried eyes.


"Victoria," he began without preamble, "what are you doing with my company's stock?"


Victoria remained pleasantly neutral. "Good afternoon,Fabio.I see news travels quickly."


"Don't play games," he replied,accent thickening with emotion. "Three banks have called about unusual trading patterns. Are you behind this?"


"Kane Industries is always exploring acquisition opportunities in complementary sectors," Victoria replied smoothly. "Your company's recent expansion aligns with our interests."


Moretti's eyes narrowed. "This isn't about strategic interests. This is about Rose Lewis."


Victoria raised an eyebrow. "I'm not sure l understand the connection."


"You understand perfectly," Moretti countered angrily. "First Rodriguez Shipping. Then the Lewis brand. Now my company. You're systematically destroying everyone connected to Rose."


Camille leaned forward. "Mr. Moretti, business isn't personal. Our interest in your company is based on infrastructure and client relationships, not personal connections."


Moretti studied her with sudden intensity. "You're Victoria's daughter. The one who appeared so suddenly last year."


"Camille Kane," she confirmed. "I've been overseeing our expansion into luxury retail distribution."


Something flickered in Moretti's eyes, a flash of recognition quickly masked. "And now you want my company."


"We want to discuss a mutually beneficial arrangement," Victoria interjected. "Your company faces significant challenges after the Lewis brand collapse. We're prepared to offer stability and growth opportunities."
Moretti's face hardened. "My family's interests include supporting my goddaughter during the worst crisis of her life."



"Again, you misunderstand our intentions," Victoria replied cooling. "But since you've raised the subject,what do you plan to do with Rose Lewis's fifteen percent stake now that her business has collapsed and embezzlement charges are forthcoming?"


Visible shock crossed Moretti's face."Embezzlement? What embezzlement?"



"It hasn't hit the news yet," Camille said, almost sympathetically. "But financial irregularities at Lewis Designs have been discovered. Significant funds diverted to personal use. The board will announce tomorrow."


Moretti seemed to age before their eyes. "I don't believeit. Not Rose."



"The evidence is quite clear," Victoria said with false compassion. "I understand this puuts you in a difficult position. Your goddaughter's reputation in tatters.

Her stake now a liability. And Kane Industries making inquiries about acquisition."


She paused. "Perhaps we should discuss how to move forward in a way that protects what matters most to you."


Moretti's expression showed the beginning of resignation.


"What are you offering?" he asked finally.


"A premium on current share values. Continued operational autonomy. And a special consulting contract that would allow you to step back while maintaining influence and income." Victoria outlined efficiently. "Plus a guaranteed position for your daughter's new fashion line in our retail distribution network."


The mention of his daughter's busness caught Moretti's attention, exactly as intended.


"And Rose's shares?" he asked, voice heavy with conflicted loyalty.
that payment would be structured to trigger immediate tax liabilities for Rose while limiting her access to the funds.


"I need time to consider," Moretti said, though his tone suggested defeat.


"Of course," Victoria agreed. "However, our offer is time-sensitive. The formal details will be delivered within the hour, with a forty-eight-hour acceptance window."


Moretti nodded distractedly. "I'll review it with my board."


After ending the call, Victoria turned to Camille with t.fobo troubles."


"Of course he did," Victoria replied. "He's known Rose since childhood. What he doesn't know is that her downfall isn't random justice but calculated destruction."


She sent a quick mnessage to the acquisition team."Proceed with the formal offer immediately.Emphasize the benefits to Moretti's daughter."


Camille watched afternoon light glitter against Manhattan's towers. "Rose will contact him the moment she hears about our offer."


"Undoubtedly," Victoria agreed. "But by then, it will be too late."


"And Rose loses another person who might have helped her rebuild," Camille said with satisfaction tinged with complexity. "Another pillar knocked away."


Victoria studied her protégée. "Does that trouble you? The systematic isolation?"
Camille met her mentor's gaze directly. "No.It feels like justice."


Victoria nodded, pleased. "Precisely. This isn't merely revenge. This is the universe rebalancing.Every person who enabled Rose Lewis's deceptions,who helped her build success on lies, they all face consequences now."


"Including Fabio Moretti," Camille concluded.


"Especially Fabio Moretti," Victoria confirmed."He knew exactly who Rose Lewis was, yet gave her legitimacy. Made her theft and deception possible through his support."


She glanced at her watch. "By this time tomorrow,we'll own controlling interest in Moretti Global Logistics. And Rose Lewis will have lost her godfather's support, both emotional and financial."


Camille moved toward the door. "Should I prepare a statement for when the acquisition is announced?"


Victoria smiled slightly. "Yes. Something about nd when she realizes what we've done?"


She'll rage. She'll threaten. She may even try to ght back," Victoria's smile widened. "But with what sources? With what allies? With what reputation or redibility?"


he answer hung unspoken between them. Rose ewis had nothing left. No company. No supporters.Jo credibility. Nothing but the growing realization hat her destruction had been meticulously planned y someone with intimate knowledge of her ulnerabilities.


'I'll draft the statement," Camille said, "and prepare for tomorrow's announcements about the who had never faced consequences for her actions.


Until now.


###Chapter 69


Rose point of view


I paced my penthouse living room, phone clutched so tightly in my hand that my knuckles turned white.The news notification still glowed on the screen:"Kane Industries Acquires Moretti Global Logistics in Surprise Takeover."


Uncle Fabio's company. My last financial lifeline.Gone.




The vodka bottle on the bar called to me, promising temporary relief from the suffocating pressure crushing my chest. Three weeks of systematic destruction had left me raw, exposed, and increasingly desperate. First my company. Then my reputation.Now my godfather's business.


The doorbell rang, its shrill tone slicing through my spiraling thoughts. I ignored it, just as l'd beer ignoring most intrusions from the outside world.Probably another reporter hoping to document my "fall from grace" with carefully choreographed photos of the disgraced fashion designer.


The bell rang again, followed by pounding that made the door shake.


"Rose! I know you're in there!"


Stefan. I froze, glass halfway to my lips. I hadn't seen him since the embezzlement news broke, since he'd looked at me with such disgust in my father's office.


The pounding continued. "Open this door, Rose! We need to talk!"



His voice held something I'd never heard before,not just anger, but a dangerous edge that sent shivers down my spine. Against my better judgment,I moved to the door and pulled it open.


Stefan looked terrible. His normally perfect appearance had deteriorated into something almost unrecognizable, wrinkled shirt, dark circles unde:bloodshot eyes, hair uncombed. But it was his expression that truly shocked me, a mixture of fury and something that looked disturbingly like hatred.


"Why aren't you answering my calls?" he demanded,pushing past me into the apartment.


"Hello to you too," I said, trying for sarcasm but achieving only a thin, brittle tone. "Please, come in."


"This isn't a social visit." He spun to face me. "I just got off the phone with your father."


My stomach dropped."And?"


"He wanted to warn me that you were being difficult about the joint statement. Said you were refusing to sign the paperwork canceling our wedding plans."


I crossed my arms defensively. "Why should I? This will all blow over eventually. The media will find someone else to destroy. We can postpone the wedding,not cancel it."


Stefan stared at me like I'd grown another head. "Are you serious? After everything that's happened? After the lies, the affairs, the stolen designs, you still think there's a future for us?"


"Of course there is," I insisted, moving toward him."People have short memories, Stefan. In six months,no one will care about these ridiculous scandals."


"Ridiculous scandals?" He backed away from my approach. "You stole other designers' work. You slept with married men to advance your career. You embezzled from your own company!"


"Those are just business realities!" Frustration made my voice rise. "Everyone does these things! They only look bad when someone packages them in the most negative light possible!"


Stefan shook his head, disgust plain on his face. "I don't even know who you are anymore. The woman I thought I was going to marry wouldn't recognize these things as 'business realities."


"The woman you thought you were going to marry never existed!" I snapped, anger suddenly boiling over. "She was a character I played because that's what men like you want, some perfect, supportive accessory who makes you look good at parties!"


"That's not fair...."


"Fair?" I laughed, the sound verging on hysterical."None of this is fair! Someone with unlimited resources has systematically destroyed everything I've built! My company, my reputation, my financial security, all gone because someone decided deserved punishment!"


"Maybe you do," Stefan said quietly.


The simple statement stopped me cold. "What?"


"Maybe you deserve exactly what's happening,"he repeated, voice hardening. "Maybe these 'ridiculous scandals' are just your past catching up with you.Maybe this is what justice looks like."


"Justice?" The word tasted bitter on my tongue. "Is that what you think this is? Someone appointed themselves judge and jury of my life because they "I don't know what else to call it," Stefan replied."Every revelation seems perfectly calculated to expose exactly who you really are. Someone who takes what they want regardless of who gets hurt."


"You're one to talk about hurting people!" The words burst from me as my control finally shattered. "You were married when we started sleeping together again! You signed divorce papers on your anniversary! You stood beside me at her funeral acting heartbroken when we both knew you were already planning our future!"


Stefan stepped back as if l'd physically struck him."That's different. I never...."


"Never what? Never lied? Never manipulated? Never caused pain?" | advanced on him, years of carefully hidden resentment suddenly pouring out. "You were so eager to believe the worst about your marriage.So ready to think Camille was boring, unambitious,unsuited to your precious Rodriguez lifestyle. All I had to do was suggest it and you accepted it as truth!"



"Stop it," Stefan warned, his expression darkening."Don't try to make this about our past. This is about who you are now. What you've done."


"Who I am?" I laughed, the sound sharp and bitter."I'm exactly who l've always been! The only difference is that now everyone knows it!"


"That's not true," Stefan said quietly. "The Rose I thought | knew wouldn't have stolen designs.Wouldn't have embezzled money. Wouldn't have..."


"Wouldn't have what?" I challenged, stepping closer until we were inches apart. "Wouldn't have done everything necessary to get what she wanted?Wouldn't have removed obstacles in her path?Wouldn't have made sure her sister's accident cleared the way for the life we deserved?"


The words hung in the air between us, impossible to retract. Stefan's face drained of color as he stared at me, horror gradually replacing anger in his expression.
"What did you just say?" he whispered.


Too late, I realized what I'd admitted in my fury.My mind raced for explanations, for clarifications, for ways to walk back the implication in my words.


"I didn't mean.... that came out wrong...." I stammeredd, cold fear replacing hot anger.


"Her accident," Stefan repeated, backing away from me. "You said her accident cleared the way. Like you knew it would happen. Like you arranged it."



"No! That's not...."


"Did you have something to do with Camille's death?" His voice was barely audible, but each word struck like physical blows.


"It wasn't supposed to be death!" The truth burst from me before I could stop it, the pressure of weeks of destruction finally breaking my control completely."He was just supposed to scare her! To make her understand she needed to leave! To give up the life that should have been mine!"
Stefan looked at me as if seeing a stranger, or worse,as if seeing a monster wearing the face of someone he thought he knew.


"You..." he whispered, horror evident in every syllable. "You arranged the accident that killed her?"


"He went too far," I said desperately, reaching for him. "It wasn't supposed to happen that way! She was just supposed to be frightened enough to leave New York, leave you, leave the fashion world I belonged in!"


Stefan recoiled from my touch, stumbling backward until he hit the wall. "You had your own sister run off the road?"



"She was ordinary!" The words tore from someplace dark and ugly inside me. "She didn't deserve you!Didn't fit into your world! She was holding you back,making you settle for less than you were meant for!"


"Less than I was meant for," Stefan repeated, his voice hollow. "And who decided what I was meant for?You?"
"We belonged together!" I insisted, desperation making me reckless. "We always did! Everything I did was for us!"


Stefan shook his head slowly, revulsion plain on his face. "There is no 'us.!' There never will be again."


He moved toward the door, each step putting more distance between us.


"Stefan, wait!" Panic overwhelmed me. "You can't just leave! We need to talk about this!"


"There's nothing to talk about," he replied, not looking back. "Our engagement is over. Whatever connection we had died the moment you admitted what you did."


"Please," I begged, all pride abandoned in the face of complete loss. "I love you! Everything I did.....everything...... was because I love you!"


Stefan paused at the door, turning to look at me one last time. The expression on his face would haunt my nightmares for years to come, not anger, not hatred,
but something worse. Something like pity mixed with profound disgust.


"Love?" he said quietly. "You don't know the meaning of the word."


The door closed behind him with a soft click that somehow hurt more than any slam would have.I stood frozen in the middle of my beautiful penthouse as the full impact of what had just happened crashed over me.


I had admitted my role in Camille's accident.


I had lost Stefan forever.


And whoever was systematically destroying my life now had the final piece they needed to complete my ruin.
###Chapter 70


Camille's point of view


I stood in Victoria's darkened office, staring at the files spread across her massive desk. The penthouse windows behind me reflected my silhouette against Manhattan's nighttime skyline, a solitary figure surrounded by the evidence of a secret alliance I'd never suspected.


Victoria was in Tokyo closing the Moretti Global acquisition, leaving me alone with access to her private servers, supposedly to prepare for my new role heading Kane Industries' fashion division.Instead, I'd stumbled across a hidden folder labeled simply "Pierce."



Now my world was tilting on its axis.


The first document had seemed innocent enough,a standard background report on Alexander Pierce and his business holdings. But the next had stopped my breath in my lungs: detailed accounts of Alexander's behind-the-scenes manipulation of markets to prevent Rose's company from securing emergency financing last month.



And it didn't stop there.


Email exchanges between Alexander's chief of security and private investigators tracking down Rose's former lovers in London. Financial records showing how Alexander's shell companies had purchased controlling interest in Rose's major retail partners shortly before they canceled her contracts.Even transcripts of calls where Alexander personally convinced fashion editors to run stories about Rose's stolen designs.


For more than a year, Alexander Pierce had been secretly advancing our revenge plan, removing obstacles, closing escape routes, ensuring that Rose and Stefan's destruction was absolute and inescapable. All without ever telling me.


My hands trembled as I picked up the most damning document of all, a detailed memo from Alexander to his chief financial officer, dated three weeks after l'd first appeared publicly as Camille Kane.


"Proceed with liquidation of all Rodriguez Shipping stock," it read. "Strategically release holdings to drive share price down. Coordinate timing with Kane Industries' debt acquisition plan. Maintain maximum deniability."


I sank into Victoria's chair, mind spinning with implications. Had Alexander been using me? Had his apparent interest been just another manipulation,another way to advance his own agenda? Or was there something deeper driving his secret campaign against Rose and Stefan?



My fingers hovered over my phone, torn between fury at his deception and a strange, growing warmth at the thought of what his covert assistance might truly mean. Before I could decide how to respond, the office door swung open.


"I see you found my Alexander file."


Victoria stood in the doorway, coat stilI on, clearly just returned from the airport. Her face revealed nothing as she moved into the room, setting her bag on a side table with deliberate calm.


"You're supposed to be in Los Angeles," I said, not bothering to hide the evidence spread across her desk.


"The Moretti signing finished early. I took the company jet back." She poured herself a scotch from the bar cart without offering me one. "So. Now you know."



"Know what exactly? That Alexander Pierce has been secretly helping destroy Rose and Stefan? That he was the mysterious benefactor closing financial doors and buying up their business connections?That he's been working alongside us this entire time without either of you telling me?"

 Victoria sipped her drink, studying me over the rim of her glass. "All of that, yes. The question is what you plan to do with this information."



I stood, gathering the documents into a neat pile."I don't know yet. Depends on why everyone's been lying to me."


"Not lying," Victoria corrected. "Selectively withholding."


"Explain the difference," I challenged, anger finally breaking through my shock.


Victoria moved to the windows, looking out at the city spread beneath us. "When I proposed our plan to destroy Rose and Stefan, you agreed under one condition, that it would be strategic, not emotional.Business,not personal. Justice, not vengeance."


"I remember."



"Alexander Pierce complicated that clean narrative."Victoria turned back to face me. "His involvement wasn't part of our original strategy. His assistance, while valuable, introduced variables I couldn't fully control."



"So when he suddenly appeared at that charity gala..."


"It wasn't sudden at all," Victoria finished for me."He'd been monitoring your progress for months.Watching Rose and Stefan's destruction from a distance. Helping accelerate it in ways | couldn't track until recently."


I sank back into the chair, trying to process this new reality. "Why? What does he get out of this?"


Victoria's expression softened almost imperceptibly."That's a question better asked directly to Alexander."



"Did you know? When we started this? Did you know about his interest in our plan?"


Victoria shook her head. "Not until three months ago.His security is remarkably thorough, but my people are better. Once I discovered his assistance in our project, I confronted him directly."


"And?"


"And we came to an understanding." Victoria finished her scotch. "His help was valuable. His resources extended our reach. His motivation, while personal,didn't interfere with our objectives."


"His motivation," I repeated. "Which was?"


"As I said, that's his story to tell." Victoria moved toward the door. "I've arranged for James to drive you to Pierce Tower tomorrow evening at eight.Whether you go is your choice."


She paused, hand on the doorknob. "For what it's worth, Camille, Alexander Pierce is perhaps the only person I've ever met whose strategic thinking matches my own. But his actions regarding our plan,regarding you, aren't strategic at all. They're something much rarer in our world."


"Which is?"


"Genuine." Victoria's mouth curved into a brief, almost sad smile. "Now that is truly valuable. Far more than revenge."


She left me alone in her office, surrounded by evidence of Alexander's secret assistance, a partnership that had been advancing my goals without my knowledge or consent.


My phone buzzed. Alexander, as if summoned by my discovery: *Dinner tomorrow? I have news about our Rose situation.*


Our Rose situation. As if we'd been partners all along. As if he hadn't been secretly orchestrating her downfall without ever mentioning his involvement.


I stared at the message, torn between the sense of betrayal at being manipulated yet again and the undeniable truth that Alexander had committed extraordinary resources to advancing my revenge against Rose and Stefan, all without taking credit, all without my knowledge.


I typed back: *We need to talk. I know everything.* His reply came immediately: *| expected you would,eventually. Would you like to hear my side of the story?*


*Tomorrow. 8pm. Your place.*


As I gathered the documents into Victoria's confidential file box, one thought kept circling in my mind: Why would Alexander Pierce, one of the world's wealthiest and most powerful men, secretly dedicate a year of his resources, his influence,and his strategic brilliance to helping a woman he barely knew destroy her enemies?


Tomorrow night, I would finally get my answers.
###Chapter 71



The elevator climbed toward the penthouse of Pierce Tower, each floor ticking by on the digital display as my stomach tightened with a mix of anger and nervous anticipation. I wore a simple black dress,nothing flashy, nothing designed to impress, and carried the folder containing evidence of Alexander's secret involvement in my revenge.


When the doors opened, I stepped into a space unlike anything I'd expected. Not the cold, modernist showcase typical of billionaire penthouses, but a warm, wood-paneled sanctuary with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and comfortable leather furniture.Classical music played softly in the background. The wall of windows offered a breathtaking view of Manhattan at sunset, the city transformed into gold and shadow. Alexander stood by a small bar cart, his back to me.He'd removed his suit jacket and rolled up his shirtsleeves, looking more approachable than I'd ever seen him.



"Scotch? Wine? Something else?" he asked without turning.


"Answers," I replied, my voice steadier than I felt.


He turned then, a slight smile on his face that didn't quite reach his eyes. "Straight to business. One of the many things I admire about you."


I tossed the folder onto his coffee table. Papers spilled out, financial records, surveillance reports,market manipulation evidence, all documenting his shadow campaign against Rose and Stefan.



"Explain this," I demanded, remaining standing even as he gestured toward a seat. "Explain why you've been secretly helping destroy Rose and Stefan for the past year without telling me."


Alexander studied me for a long moment, then moved to a bookshelf and pulled out a small wooden box. "Perhaps we should start at the beginning."


He placed the box on the table between us and finally, I sat down across from him. He opened it carefully, removing what looked like a hospital ID bracelet,faded and worn.


"Boston Memorial Hospital. Five years ago." He set the bracelet gently on top of the scattered papers."The night that changed everything."


I stared at the plastic band, confusion replacing some of my anger. "What does this have to do with Rose and Stefan?"



"Everything." Alexander sat opposite me,his eyes never leaving my face. "Five years ago, I was in a car accident on the Massachusetts Turnpike. Multiple vehicles. Three fatalities. I was trapped in the wreckage of my car, overlooked by first responders dealing with more visible victims."


A chill ran through me as fragments of memory stirred, a rainy night, flashing emergency lights, a medical conference in Boston I'd attended alone because my parents was too busy with work and perfect Rose.


"I was bleeding internally," Alexander continued."The doctors later said I hadminutes left, at most.Until someone insisted they check the less damaged vehicles. Someone who refused to leave until every person was accounted for."


My breath caught. "That was you? In the black sedan?"



Alexander nodded, something soft and vulnerable crossing his face. "That was me. And you were the one who found me. Who rode in the ambulance. Who gave her information as emergency contact when no family came forward."


The memory crystallized, the barely conscious man,face bloody and unrecognizable. The hospital forms I'd filled out while waiting for news of his condition.The nurses telling me he had no visitors, no one asking about him.

 "I stayed in Boston three extra days," I whispered,the past rushing back. "I visited your room. Read to you while you were unconscious."


"RISING EX WIFE : Love Me Again Mrs Graves,"Alexander said softly. "You said it was your favorite and the Author Annypen, was also your favorite"


Tears stung my eyes unexpectedly. "I never knew your name. The hospital just had a case number.And when I had to return to New York, to my family, l..."


"You left flowers. And a note." Alexander reached into the box again, removing a faded piece of hospital stationery. "'Whoever you are, I hope you heal completely. Someone is thinking of you,even if you're alone right now."


My throat tightened at the sight of my own handwriting from years ago. "I don't understand.If that was you, why didn't youtell me when we met?"


Alexander moved to the window, gazing out at the darkening city. "After I recovered, I tried to find you.AII I had was a name, Camille Lewis, and the knowledge that you'd attended a medical conference in Boston. It took months, but I finally tracked you down."


He turned back to me, his expression both tender and pained. "I came to New York, intent on thanking the woman who'd saved my life. But when I arrived..."


"I was married," I finished for him, understanding dawning.


"To Stefan Rodriguez. Living what seemed to be a perfect life with a successful husband and budding design career." Alexander's smile held no bitterness,only a gentle resignation. "It didn't seem right to intrude on that life, to complicate it with a stranger's gratitude."


"So you left?" The thought of how different things might have been made my heart ache.


"I left. But Ikept track of you from a distance. Just...checking occasionaly to make sure the woman who'd shown such kindness to a stranger was happy." His voice dropped lower. "Until I started noticing things. The way your husband looked at your sister when you weren't watching. The business trips that coincided with her visits from London.The gradual distance growing between you."


A cold realization washed over me. "You knew.Before it happened. You knew Stefan was betraying me with Rose."


Alexander nodded, regret clear in his eyes. "I was making arrangements to return to New York, to somehow warn you, when news broke about your accident. Your car going off that bridge. Your body never recovered."



He moved back to the sofa,sitting closer to me this time. "I didn't believe it. Couldn't accept it. I hired investigators, had them looking into every aspect of that night. But then, A week later,I discovered something unexpected. You were alive."


My head snapped up. "What do you mean? How could you possibly have known?"


"I have resources that most people can't imagine," Alexander said simply. "My security team tracked you and VVictoria leaving the cementry, after seeing the pictures i was relieved that you were alive."


Shock rippled through me. "You knew? Before Victoria ever presented me as her daughter? Before the surgeries were complete?"


Alexander nodded. "I knew Victoria had found you.Saved you. Was helping you recover and transform.But I didn't know why, or what you planned to do with your new identity."


"So all this time," I said slowly, trying to process what he was telling me, "you've known exactly who I was.Even through the surgical changes. The new identity.Everything."


"Yes," he admitted. "From the beginning."


"And you said nothing. For fifteen months." Anger briefly flared again. "You watched me build this new life, plan my revenge, and said nothing."


"What should I have said?" Alexander asked quietly. "When Victoria finally introduced you as her daughter, when you emerged with a new face and a new purpose, it was clear you'd chosen a specific path. It wasn't my place to interfere with that choice."


"Until you did interfere," I said, gesturing to the evidence on the table. "Until you started manipulating events behind the scenes, helping destroy Rose and Stefan without my knowledge."


"Not interfere," Alexander corrected gently."Support. Remove obstacles. Ensure your plan succeeded." He leaned forward, his eyes intent on mine. "I saw what they did to you, Camille. Watched helplessly as your husband betrayed you with your sister. Learned what happened the night of your 'assasination.' You deserved justice."


The raw sincerity in his voice made it impossible to maintain my anger. He had helped advance my revenge without seeking credit. Had used his considerable resources to ensure Rose and Stefan's destruction without revealing his involvement until l discovered it myself. "Why come forward now?" I asked. "Why let me discover your involvement?"



"Because revenge is ending," Alexander said simply."Rose company is destroyed. Stefan's shipping empire is in ruins. The justice you sought has largely been served."



He reached across the table, not quite touching me."And because I couldn't bear to remain in the shadows any longer, watching you wonder what comes next without offering another possibility."



"Whichis?"



"A future not defined by vengeance. By destruction."Alexander's gaze held mine steadily. "A future built on creation instead. On moving forward rather than looking back."



I studied him, this man who had known my true identity all along, who had silently supported my quest for justice without ever revealing his own connection to my past. "Why would you help me like this?" I asked, needing to hear it directly. "Commit resources, time,influence, all to help someone take revenge?"


Alexander's expression softened. "Because five years ago, a stranger showed kindness to a broken man when no one else bothered. Because I watched from afar as that same woman's life was torn apart by those who should have protected her. And because now, I find myself hoping she might allow me to be part of whatever she chooses to bouild next."


The simple sincerity in his voice broke through defenses I hadn't even realized I'd constructed. For nineteen months, Victoria had been my only ally, her strategic brilliance guiding my transformation from victim to avenger. But Victoria's help always came with calculation, with cost-benefit analysis, with emotional distance.


Alexander offered something different, support without agenda, alliance without conditions.


"I don't know what comes next," I admitted,surprised by my own vulnerability. "For nineteen 
months, revenge has been my only purpose.I never planned for after."


"Then perhaps we figure it out together," he suggested, his voice gentle. "One day at a time."


As the last rays of sunlight faded from the sky,casting the room in soft shadows, I realized something had fundamentally shifted inside me. For nineteen months, my world had contained only destruction, taking apart the lives of those who had taken mine. But sitting here, with Alexander's quiet support, I glimpsed something I hadn't dared imagine.


A future defined by what I might build, not what I had torn down.


"Why now?" I asked softly. "Why reveal yourself at this moment?"



"Because I see you standing at a crossroads,"Alexander replied. "Victory achieved, revenge nearly complete. And I wanted you to know that when you decide what comes next, you won't be facing it 
alone. Unless you want to be."


The offer hung between us, unspoken but clear.Partnership. Support. Perhaps something more, if I chose it.


"Tell me more," I said softly, "about this future you imagine."


Alexander's smile reached his eyes this time, warm and genuine. "How about over dinner? I happen to know an excellent chef who prepares meals in that kitchen over there."


For the first time in longer than I could remember, I smiled without calculation, without strategy, without performance.


"I'd like that," I said.


As Alexander led me toward the kitchen, his hand lightly touching the small of my back, I realized I was taking my first step into the unknown territory of after.

 ###Chapter 72


Camille's point of view


I stood in Victoria's office, staring at the meticulously crafted guest list on the desk between us. Names neatly typed in three columns, people whose lives would forever change in exactly two weeks' time.Rose. Stefan. Fashion industry leaders. Business rivals. Society reporters. All unknowingly summoned to witness the final act of a drama two years in the making.


"Are you certain about this?" Victoria asked, her voice carrying none of its usual commanding certainty. "Once we take this step, there's no going back."


I traced my finger down the list, stopping at Richard and Margaret Lewis. The parents who had raised me,then forgotten me when Rose's manipulation had proven more compelling than their love.


"I'm certain," I said, surprised by the steadiness in my voice. "It's time for everyone to know the truth."


After two years of careful planning, of strategic destruction, of watching from the shadows as Rose's empire crumbled piece by methodical piece, the moment had arrived for the final revelation. Camille Lewis wasn't dead. She had been reborn as Camille Kane, and she had orchestrated the systematic destruction of those who had betrayed her.


Victoria studied me, her sharp eyes missing nothing."And your motivation? Is this about justice, or is it personal satisfaction?"


The question hung between us, more significant than it might seem. For two years, Victoria had guided my transformation from broken victim to powerful avenger with one consistent warning: emotion clouds judgment. Strategic revenge required cold calculation, not heated passion.


"Both," I admitted, honesty winning over performance for perhaps the first time since my rebirth. "I want justice. But I also want to see their faces when they realize what's happened. Who's been behind their destruction."


Something like approval flickered in Victoria's eyes."At least you're honest about it. That's progress."


I moved to the windows overlooking Manhattan's skyline. Somewhere in that sprawling city, Rose was hiding in her penthouse, her fashion empire destroyed, her reputation in tatters, her fiancé gone,her godfather's company seized. Stefan was fighting to save the last remnants of his shipping business,his family legacy reduced to a single struggling office in Seattle. Both experiencing exactly the helplessness I had felt when they destroyed my life.


"Alexander thinks I should reconsider," I said, still facing the window.


Victoria's reflection appeared beside mine in the glass. "Does he now? And what are his reasons?"


"He believes revealing myself will give Rose power she currently doesn't have. Knowledge of who's been orchestrating her downfall." I turned to face Victoria. "He thinks it's smarter to let her suffer without ever knowing why."



"And what do you think?"


I considered the question carefully. Alexander's concern wasn't groundless. Rose was dangerous,manipulative, ruthless. Giving her information was giving her a weapon. But something in me needed this final confrontation, needed to stand before her,unveiled, and claim responsibility for her destruction.



"I think some victories need to be witnessed to be complete," I said finally. "Some truths need to be spoken aloud."



Victoria nodded, moving back to her desk to review the event plans. "Then we'll proceed. The Phoenix Gala, two weeks from tonight at the Kane mansion.Ostensibly to announce your appointment as president of our new Tech division."



"And actually to reveal that Camille Lewis has returned from the dead," I finished, a shiver running through me despite my resolve.


Victoria's hand paused over the papers. "There's another factor to consider. Once your true identity is revealed, there will be questions. Investigations.Legal complications. The narrative we created about your 'drowning' will undergo intense scrutiny."


I'd thought about this, of course. The police would want statements. Lawyers would raise questions about identity fraud, about insurance claims processed after my "death," about the legality of assuming a new identity.


"I'm prepared for that," I said, more confidently thanl felt. "The truth about Rose hiring someone to run me off the road will redirect most of the attention.And you have enough legal influence to handle the rest."


Victoria's slight smile acknowledged the truth of this.With her resources and connections, any legal complications would ultimately be managed, if not eliminated entirely.
  "Then there's only one question remnaining," she said,fixing me with her penetrating gaze. "After the reveal.After the satisfaction of seeing their faces. After justice is served. What then?"


The question hit harder than I expected. For two years, every thought, every action, every decision had been filtered through the lens of revenge. I had become Camille Kane for the sole purpose of destroying Rose and Stefan. What happened when that purpose was fulfilled?


"I don't know," I admitted, the vulnerable truth surprising us both.


Victoria rose, moving to stand directly before me."Two years ago, I found you in that parking garage.Beaten. Bleeding. Those men Rose had hired to 'teach you a lesson' had nearly killed you."


I nodded, remembering that night with painful clarity.The brutal attack that Rose had arranged after l'd confronted her about Stefan. Victoria appearing like some avenging angel, her driver scattering my attackers, her calm voice directing paramedics even as she offered me a choice I'd never imagined possible.


"| offered you a choice," Victoria continued."Disappear into anonymity and lick your wounds, or rise transformed and claim justice."


"I chose transformation," | said softly. "|I chose strength over victimhood. Strategy over emotion."


"We created the drowning story together," Victoria reminded me. "A way to explain your disappearance while giving us time for your recovery, for the surgeries, for your training. No one ever questioned it because no one was truly looking for you."


The painful truth hung between us. No search parties. No desperate appeals from my parents. No reward offered for information. Just a tasteful memorial service and life continuing for everyone who should have cared that I was gone.


"The drowning story served its purpose," I said,pushing away the hurt that still lingered beneath my carefully constructed exterior. "And now the truth will serve an even greater one."


Victoria touched my shoulder briefly, a rare physical gesture from a woman who typically maintained careful distance. "Don't lose your strength now that victory is within reach."


"I won't," I promised, drawing myself straighter. "But I need to figure out who Camille Kane becomes after revenge is complete."


Victoria returned to the guest list, studying the names with calculating eyes. "Each person on this list will react differently to your revelation. Rose with fury and denial. Stefan with shock and guilt. The business community with fascination and reassessment of your capabilities."


"And my parents?" I asked, the question slipping out before I could stop it.


Victoria's expression hardened slightly. "They forfeited any right to your consideration when they accepted your death so easily. When they didn't question the convenient story. When they embraced Rose as their remaining daughter without eve demanding a proper investigation."


She was right, of course. Among all the betrayals,my parents' easy acceptance of my disappearance had cut perhaps the deepest. Their grief had been real but brief, their focus quickly returning to Rose's achievements, her fashion career, her engagement to my husband.


"They'll be there," I said, studying the guest list again. "Front row seats to understand exactly what their choices cost."



Victoria nodded approvingly. "The event planning team needs final approval on the stage design. I've scheduled them for three o'clock."


"Perfect. I want everything exactly right." I moved toward the door, then paused. "Victoria? Thank you.For finding me that night. For offering me a choice when I had none."


Something almost soft flickered across her typically impassive features. "We all deserve the chance to write our own endings, Camille. Even if that means first tearing apart someone else's carefully constructed story."


I left her office with renewed determination, the guest list for the Phoenix Gala burning in my mind like a promise. Two weeks. Two weeks until masks fell away. Until truth emerged from carefully crafted lies. Until Rose and Stefan and everyone who had harmed me understood exactly who had orchestrated their destruction.



The elevator carried me down to the design department, where samples of invitation designs awaited my approval. I studied each option, finally selecting a sleek black card with a single gold phoenix rising from flames. No explanation. No hint at the true nature of the event. Just a symbol of rebirth that only I would fully understand until the night itself.


"Perfect," I told the waiting designer. "Send these out immediately. Priority delivery to everyone on the approved list."
As the designer hurried away to execute my instructions, I allowed myseIf a rare, genuine smile.In two weeks, society's elite would gather,expecting another lavish Kane industry announcement. Instead,they would witness the return of a woman everyone believed dead. Would see the mask of Camille Kane fall away to reveal Camille Lewis, transformed,empowered, and finally claiming the justice she deserved.



Rose would understand at last who had systematically destroyed everything she valued.Stefan would finally face the consequences of his betrayal. And the world would learn that sometimes,the dead don't stay buried. Sometimes, they rise from ashes, transformed into something more powerful than anyone could have imagined.


The Phoenix Gala wouIdn't just be a revelation. It would be my declaration of existence. My reclaiming of a life that others had tried to erase. And perhaps,though I wasn't ready to admit it even to myself, the first step toward discovering who I might become when revenge no longer defined my every thought and action.


Two weeks. The countdown had begun.
###Chapter 73


Camille's point of view


The Kane mansion gleamed like a jewel against the night sky, every window ablaze with light, every entrance adorned with arrangements of fire lilies and black orchids. Limousines lined the circular driveway,depositing New York's elite in a parade of designer gowns and custom tuxedos. Security guards with earpieces and impeccable suits directed the flow of guests toward the grand ballroom, where waiters circulated with champagne and delicate hors d'oeuvres.


I watched it all from Victoria's private study, a closed-circuit feed showing me every entrance,every reaction, every whispered speculation about why Kane Industries had gathered such an illustrious crowd on this particular evening.
"They're calling it the event of the season," Victoria said, adjusting the diamond clip in my hair."Everyone who matters in New York is here, wondering what magnificent announcement Camille Kane plans to make."



I barely heard her, my eyes fixed on the feed showing the main entrance. Rose had just arrived, looking thinner than I remembered but still maintaining that perfect poise that had once made me so jealous. Her designer dress, likely one of the few remaining from her collapsed fashion line, was a study in understated elegance. No one watching her would guess that her company had failed, her reputation was in tatters, and her engagement had ended in scandal.


Only I could see the strain around her eyes, the slightly too-tight smile, the carefully hidden desperation of a woman clinging to the last threads of her social standing.


"She almost didn't come," Victoria noted, following my gaze. "The invitation was returned twice before being finally accepted yesterday."


"Pride," I said softly. "She couldn't bear being excluded from an event everyone would be talking about. Even if it meant facing the woman she believes orchestrated her downfall."



Victoria nodded. "And Stefan?"



| switched to another camera feed, scanning the growing crowd until I found him. Stefan Rodriguez stood near a pillar, looking uncomfortable in his tuxedo, a glass of champagne untouched in his hand.The past months had aged him visibly, his once confident posture now slightly stooped, his face lined with stress and failure.



"Southwest corner," I said. "Alone. Watching."


Victoria studied the feed, a small smile of satisfaction curving her lips. "Perfect positioning for what's to come." She turned to me, her expression growing serious."Are you ready?"


Was I ready? After two years of planning, of careful transformation, of systematic revenge, was I ready for the moment when everyone would finally know the truth?



"Yes," I said, surprised by the steadiness in my voice."It's time."


Victoria nodded once, then moved toward the door."I'll make the introductory remarks at nine o'clock precisely. You'll enter from the left side of the stage.Everything is prepared exactly as we discussed."


After she left, I stood before the full-length mirror,taking in my appearance one final time. The woman who looked back at me was both familiar and strange, Camille Kane's surgically perfected features overlaying Camille Lewis's expressions. My midnight blue gown was simpler than the elaborate designs worn by many guests, its clean lines emphasizing the transformation of my body from soft to strong.At my throat, a simple phoenix pendant, Victoria's gift when I chose rebirth over disappearance.


"Ready or not," I whispered to my reflection.
The hidden door connecting Victoria's study to the backstage area of the ballroom opened silently. 1moved through the passage, hearing the murmur of three hundred voices growing louder with each step.At the stage entrance, I paused, watching as Victoria approached the microphone set center stage.


The crowd quieted immediately, all eyes turning to the woman whose business acumen and ruthless strategies had built an empire few dared to challenge.


"Distinguished guests," Victoria began, her voice commanding complete attention without apparent effort. "Thank you for joining us on this special evening. For those who know Kane Industries'history, you understand that we rarely host events of this magnitude without significant purpose."


I watched the crowd from my hidden position, noting how they leaned forward slightly, anticipation building. My eyes found Rose again, standing now near the bar, her expression a careful mask of polite interest that couldn't quite hide her resentment at Victoria's success contrasted with her own recent failures.



"Two years ago," Victoria continued, "I made a decision that would transform not only Kane Industries but my personal life as well. Tonight, we celebrate not just a business evolution, but a more meaningful transformation, one of identity, purpose,and justice."



A murmur rippled through the crowd. This wasn't the standard corporate announcement they had been expecting.


"Most of you know my daughter, Camille Kane,"Victoria said, her voice warming slightly. "Since her introduction to New York society, she has demonstrated exceptional business acumen and strategic vision. What none of you know is her true story. Her true identity. Her true purpose in assuming the Kane name."


The murmuring grew louder. I saw confusion on many faces, calculation on others. Rose had gone perfectly still, her champagne glass frozen halfway to her lips.


"Tonight," Victoria said, her voice dropping to ensure complete attention, "the masks come off. The truth emerges. And justice, long deferred, is finally acknowledged."


She turned toward where I stood waiting. "Ladies and gentlemen, I give you not Camille Kane, but Camille Lewis."


My cue. I stepped onto the stage, the spotlight finding me instantly, three hundred faces turning in perfect unison to stare in my direction. For a moment, complete silence filled the ballroom, a collective intake of breath as the implications of Victoria's introduction registered.



Then chaos erupted.


Gasps. Exclamations. The crash of a dropped champagne glass. Voices rising in shock and disbelief. Through it all, I walked calmly to center stage, taking my place beside Victoria, accepting the microphone she handed me with steady hands.
 

###Chapter 74


The ballroom fell silent as Camille stepped onto the stage. The crystal chandeliers above cast a glow that seemed to highlight her transformation, her posture straight and confident, her chin raised,her eyes clear and focused. Gone was the woman who had once shrunk herself to make others comfortable. In her place stood someone new, someone forged in fire.


She took the microphone from Victoria, her fingers steady despite the hundreds of wide eyes fixed on her. Whispers rippled through the crowd: "It can't be..." "She's dead..." "How is this possible?"


The faces that mattered most to her stood frozen in shock. Her mother clutched her father's arm,her mouth hanging open. Stefan had gone deathly pale,as if seeing a ghost. And Rose.... Rose's face had drained of color, her perfectly manicured nails

digging into her palms.


"Thank you all for coming tonight," Camille began,her voice carrying across the stunned silence. "Some of you knew me as Camille Lewis. Others have come to know me as Camille Kane. The truth is, I am both."


She paused, allowing her words to sink in. Camera phones were raised throughout the ballroom,recording every moment. This was not just a private revelation; it would become public knowledge within minutes.



"Eighteen months ago, I discovered divorce papers on my anniversary. My husband, Stefan Rodriguez..."she gestured toward him, and the crowd's eyes followed ".....had decided our marriage was over because he had fallen in love with my sister, Rose."


Stefan flinched visibly, taking a half-step back as if trying to disappear into the crowd.


"What I didn't know then was that this wasn't a recent development. You see, Rose and Stefan had a relationship for years before I ever met him. I was simply a placeholder, a convenient detour on their path to being together."


Gasps echoed through the ballroom. Camille took a slow breath, centering herself. She wouId not rush through this moment she had prepared for so long.


"On the night I signed those divorce papers,something inside me broke. I thought I had lost everything. Little did I know that loss was just the beginning."


She looked directly at Rose now, whose face had shifted from shock to something darker, a mixture of rage and fear.


"After I left, I was attacked in a parking garage. Men who were hired to deliver a message. They beat me until I could barely stand. They told me to leave New York and never come back, that I wouldn't survive a second warning."


Her mother let out a low moan, covering her mouth with trembling hands. "I would have died that night if Victoria Kane hadn't found me." Camille turned to Victoria, who stood like a sentinel at the side of the stage. "She saved me,not just by stopping the attackers, but by showing me that I could transform my pain into power."


Victoria gave her a subtle nod, her face showing rare public emotion.


"The question, of course, is who would want me gone so badly? Who would pay to have me attacked?Who would benefit most from my disappearance?"


All eyes shifted to Rose, who had begun to back away,looking for an exit.


"Rose Lewis arranged my murder," Camille stated,her voice cutting through the room like a blade. "My sister, the person who claimed to love me,orchestrated an attack meant to frighten me into leaving or.... if necessary... ensure | never spoke again."


The crowd erupted in murmurs. Security guards subtly moved to block the exits.
"I have evidence," Camille continued once the noise died down. "Bank transfers, phone records,testimony from the men who were hired. Everything has been provided to the district attorney's office."



Rose lunged forward suddenly, her mask of sophistication entirely gone. "You lying bitch!" she screamed, her voice raw with fury. "You had everything! Everything was handed to you while I had to fight for scraps!"


Security moved toward Rose, but Camille raised a hand to stop them. This confrontation had been years in the making. She wouldn't cut it short now.


"I never wanted to hurt you," Camille said, keeping her voice steady. "But you plotted against me my entire life. You manipulated everyone around me.You took joy in my pain."


"I only wanted what should have been mine!" Rose shouted, tears streaming down her face now,smearing her perfect makeup. "Do you know what it's like to watch someone else live the life you deserved? I was the one who fought my way out of
foster care! I was the one who clawed my way into this family! And you.... you were always the favorite,the precious daughter, while I was just the charity case they took in!"


The ballroom was utterly silent now, the crowd watching the scene unfold with horrified fascination.


"So yes, I arranged for those men to scare you,"Rose continued, past caring about the consequences of her confession. "You were supposed to run away,not die. And when your car was pulled from the river, I thought...." She stopped abruptly, realizing what she was admitting.


"You thought your plan had worked too well," Camille finished for her. "You thought I was dead, and you celebrated while pretending to mourn."


Her mother stepped forward then, her face ashen."Rose... tell me this isn't true. Tell me you didn't try to hurt your sister."


Rose's laugh was hollow. "Sister? She was never my sister. She was an obstacle, a roadblock standing between me and everything I wanted."


"And what exactly did you want, Rose?" Camille asked, though she already knew the answer.


"Everything that was yours," Rose spat. "Stefan, your family, your social standing. I deserved it all more than you ever did."



Stefan finally found his voice, stepping away from Rose as if she were toxic. "You told me Camille left because she couldn't handle us being together. You said she ran away..."



"And you believed me because it was convenient,"Rose shot back. "Don't pretend you're innocent in this, Stefan. You were all too happy to move on with me the minute she was gone."


Camille watched the man she had once loved crumble under the weight of his guilt. There was a time when she had dreamed of this moment, of seeing him broken. Now, she felt nothing but a distant pity.
Her father approached the stage, his shoulders hunched with shame. "Camille, my Godd...we didn't know. We should have known, but we didn't see..."


"No, you didn't see," Camille agreed, her tone gentle but firm. "You never saw me. Not really. And you certainly never saw who Rose truly was, despite all the signs."


Her mother was weeping openly now. "Please,Camille. Please forgive us. We can be a family again.We can make this right."


For a moment, Camille felt a flicker of her old self, the young woman who had always sought approval, who had always tried to keep the peace. But that woman was gone, burned away in the transformation that had created who she was now.



"I'm afraid that's not possible," she said. "Camille Lewis died that night in the parking garage. The woman who stands before you is Camille Kane.Victoria has legally adopted me, and I am her heir.That ###Chapter of my life is closed forever."
"You can't just erase us!" her mother cried,desperation in her voice. "We're your parents!"


"You stopped being my parents the moment you chose to believe in Rose's lies rather than seeing the truth that was right in front of you," Camille replied,sadness coloring her words despite her resolve. "I don't hate you. I simply don't need you anymore."


Stefan moved toward the stage, his eyes pleading."Camille, I know I can never undo what I did. But I've changed. Seeing what Rose really is, understanding what happened to you, it's opened my eyes. Please,just give me a chance to show you how sorry l am."


Camille studied his face, remembering how she had once thought he was the center of her world.How small that world had been.


"I forgive you, Stefan," she said finally. "Not because you deserve it, but because I refuse to carry the weight of hating you any longer. That forgiveness doesn't mean reconciliation. It means freedom, my freedom from you."
Rose had been watching this exchange with growing fury, her entire body rigid with anger. "You think you've won?" she hissed. "You think this grand display changes anything? This isn't over. You took everything from me, and I'll make you pay for it."


Camille met her gaze evenly. "No, Rose. I took back what was mine.... my dignity, my power, my life.Everything else, you lost all on your own."


Rose looked around wildly, seeing all eyes on her,seeing her carefully constructed world collapsing.Her face contorted with rage as she pointed a trembling finger at Camille.


"This isn't over," she hissed, loud enough for everyone to hear. "You think you've won? You think you can just come back from the dead and destroy everything I've built? I'll make you pay for this,Camille. You have no idea what I'm capable of."


With that, Rose stormed toward the exit,shoving past guests who quickly moved out of her way. The heavy doors slammed behind her with an echoing finality.

As Rose disappeared, Camille felt a peculiar lightness spreading through her chest. This moment that she had imagined for so long... it wasn't bringing the savage triumph she had expected. Instead,there was something quieter,something like peace.


Victoria joined her on stage, placing a steady hand on her shoulder. "You did well," she said quietly.


"Is it over?" Camille asked, suddenly uncertain.


"The revenge is over," Victoria replied. "But your life.... your real life...... is just beginning."


Camille turned back to face the crowd, many of whom were still recording every moment on their phones. The story would be everywhere by morning.There would be legal battles, public scrutiny,endless questions. But for the first time since that night in the parking garage, Camille felt truly free.


"Thank you for coming tonight," she said to the crowd, her voice strong and clear. "This event marks not just the revelation of the truth, but the beginning of something new. The phoenix doesn't rise from the ashes to return to what it was. It rises transformed,stronger than before."


She felt Alexander Pierce's eyes on her from somewhere in the crowd, and for the first time,she allowed herself to acknowledge the possibility of a future beyond this moment, a future not defined by the past but open to new possibilities.


"The Phoenix Foundation will provide support for victims of domnestic abuse and those who have been betrayed by the people closest to them," she continued. "Sometimes the deepest wounds come from those we trust the most. But tonight proves that even from complete destruction, something beautiful can emerge."


As she stepped away from the microphone, the room erupted in applause.... whether from genuine support or simply the spectacle of it all, she couldn't tell. But as Victoria led her from the stage, Camille knew that whatever came next, she would face it not as the woman who had been discarded and betrayed, but as someone entirely new.

Camille Kane had risen from the ashes of Camille Lewis's destruction. And unlike the old fairy tales,this phoenix wasn't interested in happy endings with false princes or fractured families. She was interested in building something true, something that was entirely her own.


The revenge story had ended. Her real story was just beginning.

###Chapter 75


Rose slammed her apartment door with such force that a framed photo crashed to the floor, glass shattering across the marble entryway. She didn't bother to pick it up. Instead, she kicked off her heels,sending them flying across the room where one knocked over a crystal vase, water and flowers spilling onto the pristine white carpet.


She didn't care. Nothing mattered anymore.


Her hands shook as she poured herself a drink,missing the glass entirely on the first try. Amber liquid pooled on the counter, but she ignored it,finally managing to fill the tumbler on her second attempt. She drained it in one guIp, the burn in her throat nothing compared to the inferno raging inside her chest.


"She's alive," Rose whispered, her voice raspy and strange to her own ears. "AlI this time... she's been alive."


The reality of what had happened at the gala crashed over her in waves. Camille, her pathetic, weak,doormat of a sister, had orchestrated her downfall.Camille, who had always been the good daughter,the perfect wife, the helpless victim, had been playing them all.


Rose hurled her empty glass across the living room where it exploded against the wall, leaving a dark stain on the cream-colored paint like a Rorschach test of her rage.


"AAAGGHH!" The scream that tore from her throat sounded animal, primal. Rose grabbed the nearest object, a glass paperweight, and smashed it into the mirror above her fireplace. Her reflection fractured into a thousand broken pieces.


Better. That felt better.


She moved through her apartment like a tornado,destroying everything in her path. Photo frames, vases, dishes, all shattered against walls, floors,windows. She tore designer clothes from her closet,ripping fabrics that had cost thousands, snapping heels off shoes, pulling jewelry apart until beads and gems scattered across the floor like tiny marbles.


When she reached the bedroom, she froze. There on the nightstand sat a photo of her and Stefan,happy,smiling,victorious. She had won him. She had taken him from Camille. He was supposed to be her prize.


Rose lifted the frame with trembling fingers.Stefan's face stared back at her, the face she had desired for so long, the man who had been part of her meticulous plan.


"You let her do this to us," she hissed at his image."You coward. You stood there and let her destroy everything!"


She smashed the frame against the edge of the marble nightstand, glass cutting into her palm. Blood dripped onto the photo, staining his face red.Perfect. That's what he deserved.
Rose sank onto the edge of her bed, suddenly exhausted. Her anger momentarily gave way to the crushing weight of what she had lost. Her business.Her reputation. Stefan. Even her place in the Lewis family seemed uncertain now, the way her mother had looked at her at the gala, with such disgust and disappointment.


She had spent years carefully building this life,crafting her image, positioning herself at the top of New York society. And in one night, Camnille had taken it all away.


Rose pulled her knees to her chest, a sob rising in her throat. But no, she wouldn't cry. Crying was weakness, and she wasn't weak. She had survived foster homes where no one wanted her. She had fought her way into the Lewis family. She had built a fashion brand from nothing.


She was Rose Lewis. She didn't break. She got even.


Rising from the bed, Rose went to her closet and pulled out the one box she hadn't destroyed. Inside was a burner phone, cash, a passport with a different name, and account numbers for money she had hidden away years ago, her emergency escape plan.She had always been prepared for disaster, always had a backup plan. That's how she had survived.


But she wasn't going to run. Not this time.


Rose walked to her bathroom, ignoring the trail of destruction behind her. Blood still dripped from her cut palm, but she paid it no mind as she turned on the cold water and splashed her face. Mascara ran down her cheeks in black rivers, her carefully applied makeup washing away to reveal the woman beneath,harder, colder, more determined than the polished socialite she presented to the world.


She stared at herself in the mirror, water dripping from her chin.



"This isn't over," she whispered, echoing her words from the gala. "Not by a long shot."


The shock was wearing off now, her mind beginning to work again, analyzing, calculating. Camille had help, that much was obvious. Victoria Kane. The powerful billionaire had taken Camille in, trained her,given her the resources to carry out this revenge.


Rose laughed, a harsh sound in the quiet bathroom.


"So that's who you are now, Camille? Victoria Kane's pet project? Her weapon against me?" She shook her head. "She doesn't know who she's dealing with."


Rose wrapped a towel around her bleeding hand and returned to the living room, stepping over broken glass and torn fabric. She found her laptop buried under a pile of shredded documents and opened it.


First, she needed to understand how bad the damage was. Her fingers flew across the keyboard as she checked news sites, social media, financial reports. It was worse than she thought.#CamilleReturns was trending. Videos from the gala had gone viral. Her own screamed confession was being shared millions of times.


Her fashion line was officially dead. Her remaining business partners had all issued statements distancing themselves from her. Her bank accounts were indeed frozen pending investigation.


She had nothing left. Almost nothing.


Rose clicked on a news story about Victoria Kane.

The woman was powerful, yes, but not untouchable.

Everyone had weaknesses. Everyone had secrets.


Including Camille.


Rose leaned back, her mind racing. Camille had faked her death. There would be legal implications to that. Insurance fraud, perhaps? And what about Victoria's role in the deception? There had to be something there, one angle Rose could exploit.


She pulled out a notebook and began to write,ignoring the blood that occasionally smeared the page. She listed everyone connected to Camille and Victoria. She noted possible vulnerabilities, potential allies. She mapped out scenarios, strategies, points of attack.



By dawn, Rose had filled dozens of pages. Her eyes burned from lack of sleep, her hand throbbed where the glass had cut her, but her mind was clear. The path forward was taking shape.


She stood and stretched, surveying the destruction of her apartment in the gray morning light. It looked like a war zone, which was fitting, because that's exactly what this was now. War.


Rose walked to the window and looked out over the Manhattan skyline, the sun just beginning to rise behind the skyscrapers. Somewhere out there,Camille was celebrating her victory, thinking she had won.



"Enjoy it while it lasts, sister," Rose whispered against the glass. "You took everything from me.Now I'm going to take everything from you. And this time,I won't fail."


She turned from the window, a cold calm settling over her. The initial storm of rage had passed,leaving behind something more dangerous,calculated,patient vengeance.


Rose stepped over the broken glass and torn fabric without a backward glance. She needed a shower,fresh clothes, a new phone. She needed to contact the few people who might still be loyal to her. She needed to start rebuilding.


Because this wasn't the end of her story. It was merely the beginning of a new ###Chapter, one where she would no longer be fighting for Stefan or social status or a fashion empire.


Now, she was fighting for pure survival. And there was nothing more dangerous than a woman with nothing left to lose.


Rose smiled as she stepped into the shower, letting hot water wash away the blood and tears and makeup. Let Camille think she had won. Let Victoria Kane believe they had destroyed her completely.


They had no idea what she was capable of.


As steam filled the bathroom, Rose struggled to formulate a plan. She had no leverage against Victoria Kane or Camille. She had no hidden information to use as a weapon. Her finances were her burning desire for revenge and the stubborn refusal to accept defeat.

She shut off the water and wrapped herself in a towel, suddenly feeling more energized than she had in months. There was clarity in complete destruction.Freedom in having nothing left to protect.

Rose looked at herself in the mirror, her appearance disheveled but her eyes burning with determination.She splashed cold water on her face again, washing away the last traces of mascara.


"This isn't finished," she whispered to her reflection."Not by a long shot."


She returned to the living room, stepping through the wreckage of her former life. The broken glass Victoria Kane, the woman was too powerful,too protected. She had no dirt on Camille that hadn't already been exposed. She had no money, no allies,no escape plan that would truly work.


But she had her rage. And her determination. Arre the knowledge that she had rebuilt herself once before, when she had nothing.


"I will find a way," she said to the empty room. "I don't know how yet, but I will."


Rose curled up in the chair as dawn broke over Manhattan, illuminating the destruction around her.She had no plan yet, no clear path forward. But one thing was certain, this wasn't over. Not while she still drew breath.



She would wait. She would watch. And eventually she would find Camille's weakness.


The game had changed, but in Rose's mind, it wasn't over.


Not even close.
###Chapter 76


The lobby of Kane Industries gleamed with polished marble and sleek glass. Camille stepped out of the elevator on the top floor, her heels clicking against the floor as she walked toward her office. Three days had passed since the Phoenix Gala, and her mind still buzzed with the memory of Rose's face as the truth was revealed, the shock on Stefan's features, the horror in her parents' eyes.



Now the world knew who she really was. The media couldn't get enough of the story: the supposedly dead wife who had returned as a powerful executive,the systematic destruction of her ex-husband's company and her sister's reputation. Somne painted her as a victim-turned-hero, others as a manipulative schemer. Camille didn't care which version they believed.
 
She pushed open the glass door to her office and stopped short. A massive arrangement of white roses sat on her desk, their scent filling the room. A knot formed in her stomach. She knew who they were from before she even read the card.


"Ms. Kane," her assistant Rebecca said from behind her, "I'm sorry. He sent them before | arrived this morning. Security checked them thoroughly."


Camille nodded, finding her voice. "It's fine,Rebecca. Could you please take them away? Donate them to the hospital across the street."


Rebecca quickly removed the flowers while Camille settled at her desk, turning her attention to the documents awaiting her signature. She had just begun reviewing the first contract when Rebecca's voice came through the intercom.


"Ms. Kane, Stefan Rodriguez is in the lobby requesting to see you. Security wants to know if they should turn him away."


Camille's pen stilled above the paper. She had expected this, of course. It was only a matter of time before he would try to reach out. Still, her heart hammered uncomfortably against her ribs.


"Tell them to send him up," she said after a moment."And Rebecca, please stay close by. If I need you, I'll call."


"Of course, Ms.Kane."


Five minutes later, Stefan stood in her doorway.He looked awful, shadows beneath his eyes, his normally perfect suit slightly rumpled, his face drawn with exhaustion. There was a time when seeing him like this would have torn at her heart, when she would have done anything to comfort him.


Now she just felt... nothing.


"Come in and close the door," she said, gesturing to the chair across from her desk. She remained standing, unwilling to cede even that small advantage.


Stefan stepped inside, his eyes never leaving her name. "I still can't believe it's really you."

sn't," she replied coolly. "Not the woman you N,anyway."

linched at her tone, then moved closer, stopping n she held up a hand. "Please, Camille. I just t to talk. I've been going crazy since the gala.I t sleep, I can't eat...."

at do you want, Stefan?" Camille cut him off, her e steady despite the storm inside her. "Why are nere?"


eded to see you." He ran a hand through his hair,ng it slightly disheveled in a way that once would made her heart skip. "To explain..." maintain.


"I was a fool," Stefan said, his eyes filling with tears." was blind and stupid and selfish. Rose... she manipulated me, fed me lies about you,about us..."


"Stop." Camille raised her hand again. "Don't blame Rose for your choices. You weren't hypnotized. You weren't drugged. You looked me in the eye and lied to me for months. That was all you."


Stefan seemed to collapse within himself, sinking into the chair. "You're right. I'm not trying to escape responsibility. What | did was unforgivable."


"And yet here you are, seeking forgiveness." Camille finally sat down, keeping her desk between them like a shield.


"Not just forgiveness." Stefan leaned forward, his eyes suddenly burning with intensity. "A second chance. Camille, I never stopped loving you.Even with Rose, even after I thought you were gone...there was always something missing. It was you. It's always been you."
A bitter laugh escaped her throat. "Are you serious?You think after everything you've done,everything that's happened, we could just... what? Get back together? Resume our marriage like none of this ever occurred?"


"Not right away, of course," Stefan rushed to say. "I know it would take time, years maybe. But we could start over. I could prove to you that I've changed, that I understand what I threw away." He reached across the desk, trying to take her hand, but she moved it away. "Camille, please. The company, the money,none of that matters. I'd give up everything just for the chance to make things right wwith you."


Camille studied him, this man she had once loved beyond reason. She could see the desperation in his eyes, the genuine misery. There was a time when his pain would have been her pain, when she would have done anything to ease his suffering.


That time was gone.


"Do you know what I remember most about our marriage, Stefan?" she asked quietly. "Not the happy moments. Not the trips or the gifts or the fancy dinners. I remember sitting alone on our anniversary,waiting for you to come home. I remember making excuses for you to my friends when you canceled our plans. I remember the way you would look through me sometimes, like I wasn't even there."


"I was a terrible husband," Stefan admitted, his voice breaking. "But people change.I've changed."


"Have you?" Camille tilted her head. "Or have your circumstances changed? You've lost your company.Your reputation is in tatters. Rose has shown her true colors. And suddenly, conveniently, you remember your lòve for me?"


Stefan flinched asif she'd slapped him. "That's not fair."


"Isn't it? Tell me something, Stefan. If none of this had happened, if I hadn't 'died,' if your business was still thriving, if Rose was still the woman you thought she was, would you be here right now, begging for a second chance? Or would you be planning your wedding with her?"

His silence was answer enough.


Camille stood up, smoothing her skirt with steady hands. "You don't love me, Stefan. You never did.Not really. You loved the idea of me, the supportive wife, the pretty accessory, the woman who never challenged you or made you uncomfortable. That woman doesn't exist anymore. She died the night l found your divorce papers."



"You're wrong," Stefan said, standing too, his voice gaining strength. "Yes, I was blind and selfish then.But these past months without you... thinking you were dead... it changed me, Camille. And seeing you again, knowing what you went through because of me...."



"Because of Rose," she corrected.



"Because of both of us," he insisted. "I may not have hired those men, but I created the situation that led to it. I share the blame. And I have to live with that for the rest of my life."


For a moment, Camille saw something genuine in his eyes, real remorse, real pain. But it wasn't enough.It would never be enough.


"I believe that you're sorry," she said finally. "And I meant what I said at the gala, I forgive you. Not for your sake, but for mine. I refuse to carry the weight of hating you anymore."


Hope flickered across his face."Then...."


"But forgiveness isn't the same as forgetting," she continued. "And it certainly doesn't mean a second chance. There are some things that, once broken,can never be fixed."


"Camille, please." Stefan moved around the desk,dropping to his knees beside her chair. The gesture was so unexpected, so unlike the proud man she had known,that she didn't back away. "I'll do anything.Anything at all. Just tell me what I need to do to make things right. I can't lose you again."


Looking down at him, Camille felt a strange mixture of pity and disgust. "You already lost me, Stefan. A long time ago. You just didn't notice until it was too late."


She stood, forcing him to rise as well. "Our story is over. It ended the moment you decided Rose was more important than our vows. What came after, my 'death,' my transformation, your company's downfall,none of that changes the simple truth that we're done."


"I don't accept that," Stefan said, a flash of his old stubbornness showing through. "I know I hurt you.I know I don't deserve another chance. But I also know what we had was real. And if there's even a tiny part of you that remembers what we meant to each other..."


"What we had wasn't real," Camille cut him off,her voice gentle but firm. "It was a lie. You were with my sister before me, during our marriage, and you'd stil be with her now if the truth hadn't come out. That's not love, Stefan. That's convenience."


Her words seemed to hit him physically, and he staggered back a step. "You can't mean that. You can't believe that everything we shared was false."
"What I believe doesn't matter anymore." Camille moved toward the door, making it clear the conversation was ending. "What matters is that l've moved on. I've built a new life, a new identity. And you have no place in it."


Stefan didn't move, his shouldersslumped in defeat."I won't give up, Camille. Not this time. I'll prove to you that l've changed, that I can be the man you deserve."


A small, sad smile touched her lips. "That's the thing,Stefan. I no longer need a man to make me whole.I don't need you, or anyone, to 'complete' me.The woman who defined herself by her husband died in that parking garage. The woman standing before you is complete on her own."


She opened her office door, where Rebecca was waiting as instructed. "Rebecca will show you out.Please don't send any more flowers. Don't call. Don't come here again. It's over, Stefan. Accept that and move on with your life. I already have with mine."


Something in her tone must have finally reached him, because the fight seemed to drain from his body. He walked toward the door, then paused beside her.


"I really did love you, Camille," he whispered. "In my own flawed, selfish way. I just wish I had realized what that meant before it was too late."



Camille met his gaze one last time, seeing the ghost of the man she had once thought would be her forever."Goodbye,Stefan."


He nodded once, accepting her dismissal, and followed Rebecca toward the elevator. Camille watched him go, waiting for some flicker of regret,some pull of old feelings.


There was nothing.


Back in her office, she walked to the window overlooking the city. The woman she had been,Camille Lewis, devoted wife, perfect daughter,loving sister, would have crumbled at Stefan's pleas. She would have forgiven him instantly, welcomed him back with open arms, grateful for the second chance. But that woman was gone, burned away in the fire of betrayal and reborn as someone stronger, someone who valued herself too much to accept scraps of affection from a man who had discarded her so easily.


Camille Kane turned back to her desk, to the contracts awaiting her signature, to the empire she was helping to build. The past was finally, truly behind her. Whatever came next, whether it was success or failure, joy or pain, it would be on her terms, not defined by the people who had once claimed to love her.


For the first time since the night everything changed,Camille felt truly free.
###Chapter 77


Rain pounded against the windows of Camille's office, matching her mood as she stared at the notification on her phone. The message was brief:her parents were waiting in the lobby. No warning, no call ahead. They had simply shown up, expecting her to drop everything and see them.


Some things never changed.


"Ms. Kane?" Rebecca stood in the doorway,her expression concerned. "Your.., the Lewises are downstairs. They're insisting on seeing you."


Camille set down her pen, her fingers surprisingly steady despite the storm brewing inside her. "How long have they been waiting?"


"Almost an hour. They refuse to leave without speaking to you."

Of course they did. Margaret and Richard Lewis had always believed doors should open for them, that their demands warranted immediate attention. Even now, after everything that had happened, they expected their daughter, the daughter they had failed so completely, to bend to their will.


"Send them up in fifteen minutes," Camille said,turning back to her computer. "Not a second earlier."


Rebecca nodded and disappeared, leaving Camille alone with thoughts she had tried to bury since the Phoenix Gala. Unlike with Stefan, whose visit she had anticipated and prepared for, this confrontation caught her off guard. She had hoped her parents would respect her wishes, would understand that some bridges couldn't be rebuilt.


But hope had always been her weakness where family was concerned.


Camille stood and walked to the window, watching raindrops race down the glass. The sky had turned nearly black, thunder rumbling in the distance. A perfect backdrop for the scene about to unfold.

Fifteen minutes later, Rebecca's voice came through the intercom. "They're here,Ms.Kane."


"Send them in," Camille replied, remaining by the window, her back to the door.


She heard them enter, heard her mother's sharp intake of breath, heard her father clear his throat,that familiar sound that had always preceded his lectures. Camille didn't turn around.



"Camille," her mother's voice broke on her name."Please look at us."



Slowly, Camille turned. They looked smaller somehow, diminished. Her mother's carefully maintained appearance showed cracks, hair not quite perfect, makeup slightly smudged from the rain or perhaps tears. Her father stood straight as always,but new lines marked his face, and his eyes held none of their usual confidence.


"Why are you here?" Camille asked, her voice flat.


"Because you're our daughter," her father said, as if that explained everything, as if the word "daughter"still meant anything between them.


"We've been going out of our minds," her mother added, taking a step forward. "Ever since the gala,we've been trying to process everything. To understand how...."


"How I survived?" Camille finished for her. "How I became someone new? Or how your precious Rose tried to have me killed?"


Her mother flinched. "All of it. Please, Camille. We need to talk about this."


"There's nothing to talk about." Camille moved back to her desk, putting the solid oak barrier between them. "I said everything I needed to say at the gala."


"You can't mean that," her father insisted,moving closer. "We're your parents. Whatever mistakes we've made...."


"Mistakes?" Camille's laugh held no humor. "Is that what you call it? A mistake?"

Her father faltered, then straightened his shoulders."We had no idea what Rose had done. How could we possibly have known?"


"Because I told you," Camille replied, her voice rising despite her efforts to stay calm. "I stood in our family home and told you both that Rose was having an affair with Stefan. That she had manipulated both of us. And what did you do? You defended her. You chose her."


"We didn't believe it because it seemed impossible,"her mother said, tears spilling onto her cheeks."Rose has been part of our family since she was thirteen.We raised her, loved her..."


"You didn't raise her," Camille cut in. "You adopted a teenager who had already formed her worldview,who saw our family as a prize she had won, not a gift of love. And you didn't just love her, you favored her.You always did."


"That's not true," her father protested, but the doubt in his eyes betrayed him.

"Isn't it? When Rose got a B in math, you hired a tutor and praised her efforts. When I got an A-,you asked why it wasn't an A. When Rose wore something you didn't approve of, it was 'expressing herself. When I did the same, I was 'embarrassing the family.'"


The memories rushed back, a lifetime of small cuts that had bled her confidence dry. "And it wasn't just when we were young. When I told you Stefan was cheating,your first instinct wasn't to comfort me or protect me, it was to question whether I had somehow caused it."


Her mother shook her head desperately."We didn't mean to hurt you. We loved you both equally..."

"No," Camille said softly. "You didn't. And deep down, you know that's true."


Silence filled the room, broken only by the thunder outside and her mother's muffled sobs.


"Camille," her father finally said, his voice rough."We've made terrible mistakes. Unforgivable ones.

But you're alive, our daughter is alive. Surely that's a second chance, a miracle. Can't we at least try to heal this?"


"Heal what, exactly?" Camille asked. "The fact that you never truly saw me? That you believed the worst of me and the best of Rose, no matter the evidence?That when I needed you most, you abandoned me for the daughter you preferred?"


Her father's face crumpled, his carefullymaintained facade finally breaking. "We were wrong.So terribly wrong. When we heard about your... your death, it destroyed us. We've spent the last year living with the knowledge that our last conversation with you was an argument, that you died believing we didn't love you."


"And now that I'm not dead, you want absolution."Camille's voice remained steady, though her heart pounded painfully inher chest. "You want me to tell you it's okay, that I forgive you, so you can sleep at night."


"We want our daughter back," her mother pleaded, moving around the desk to reach for Camille's hand Camille stepped away, maintaining the distance between them.


"Your daughter is gone," she said quietly. "Camille Lewis died that night in the parking garage. The woman standing before you is someone else entirely."


"No." Her mother shook her head fiercely. "You might have a different name, a different life, but you're stil our child. Nothing can change that, not even what Rose did."



"This isn't about Rose," Camille said. "Not entirely.Yes,she was my executioner. But you handed her the tools."



Her parents flinched as if physically struck.


"Every time you praised her at my expense, every time you dismissed my feelings, every time you made it clear she was the daughter you truly wanted,you gave her more power to hurt me. You taught her that she was special, exceptional, deserving of everything she wanted. And you taught me that my pain didn't matter, that my instincts couldn't be trusted."


Camille walked back to the window,watching lightning streak across the darkened sky. "When Stefan gave me those divorce papers, do you know why I didn't come to you? Because I already knew what you would say. That I must have done something wrong. That I hadn't tried hard enough.That perfect Stefan couldn't possibly be at fault."



"That's not true," her father protested weakly.


"Isn't it?" Camille turned to face them again."When I finally did tell you about his affair with Rose, that's exactly what happened. You defended them both.You questioned my sanity rather than their integrity."


Her mother sank into a chair, her body shaking with sobs. Her father stood helplessly, his eyes revealing the truth he couldn't bring himself to admit, that every word Camille spoke was accurate.


"We've lost everything," her mother whispered."Rose is gone. The family name is ruined. And now you... you won't even give us a chance to make amends."


"Some things can't be fixed," Camille said, a hint of gentleness entering her voice despite her resolve to remain detached. "Some betrayals cut too deep. This isn't a Hollywood movie where the estranged family has a tearful reunion and everything is magically healed. Real life doesn't work that way."


"So that's it?" her father asked, his voice breaking."Twenty six years of family just... erased? You're throwing away your entire past?"


"My past was already taken from me," Camille replied. "The night I discovered my husband and sister had betrayed me. The night men attacked me in a parking garage and left me for dead. The night I realized my parents would never believe me over their precious Rose,"



She moved back to her desk, signaling that the conversation was ending. "I don't hate you.I don't wish you ill. I simply don't have room in my new life for people who couldn't love me as I deserved to be loved."


"Please," her mother begged, rising from the chair."Just give us a chance. We can start over. We can do better."


"It's too late," Camille said, her voice final. "Ispent my entire life trying to earn your approval, your love.I'm done trying."


Her father approached the desk, his proud posture now bent with grief. "What can we do? There must be something. Some way to reach you."


Camille looked at them both, these people who had given her life but failed to nurture her spirit,who had provided material comfort but withheld emotional security. For a moment, she felt a flicker of the old longing, the desperate need for their approval that had driven so many of her choices.


But that flicker died quickly, smothered by the memory of their betrayal.


"There's nothing you can do," she said softly.

"Except respect my wishes and leave me alone Don't call. Don't visit. Don't reach out through friends or colleagues. Consider Camille Lewis dead,because that's what she is to me."


"You can't mean that," her mnother whispered. "We're your parents. That bond can't just be severed."


"It already was," Camille replied. "You severed it years ago, piece by piece, with every dismissal, every criticism, every time you chose Rose over me. I'm just acknowledging what has long been true."


Her father's face hardened, his grief giving way to anger, his typical response when he couldn't control a situation. "So that's it? After everything we've givenyou,everything we've sacrificed..."


"This isn't about what you gave me," Camille interrupted, her voice sharp. "It's about what you didn't give me. Protection. Trust. The benefit of the doubt. Unconditional love. The things parents are supposed to provide."


She pressed the intercom button. "Rebecca, could you please come in? The Lewises are leaving."


"You can't dismiss us like employees," her father protested.


"I can and I am." Camille stood firm, her resolve unshaken. "I told you at the gala that our relationship was over. I meant it. The only reason I agreed to see you today was to make that absolutely clear."


Rebecca appeared at the door, her expression professionally neutral despite the obvious tension in the room.


"Please escort Mr. and Mrs. Lewis to the lobby,"Camille instructed.


"Camille, please..." her mother reached for her one last time.


"Goodbye," Camille said firmly. "I wish you well, but I don't want you in my life. Not now. Not ever."


Her father's face twisted with a mixture of grief and indignation. "You'll regret this. Someday, when you're older, when you have children of your own,you'll understand that family is all that matters in the end."


Camille met his gaze unflinchingly. "You taught me exactly what family means, that it's conditional, that love can be withdrawn if you don't meet expectations, that blood ties don't guarantee protection or support. It's the most valuable lesson you ever gave me, and I won't forget it."


Her mother let out a strangled sob as Rebecca gently guided them toward the door. Her father looked back once, his eyes filled with a pain Camille recognized all too well, the agony of rejection, of not being enough. She had lived with that pain her entire life.



When the door closed behind them, Camille remained standing, her body rigid with tension. She had expected to feel triumphant, or at least relieved.Instead, a hollow ache spread through her chest, not regret, exactly, but mourning for what could have been, for the parents they might have been in another life, for the daughter she might have been if they had truly loved her. Outside, the storm intensified, rain lashing agains the windows as if nature itself shared her turmoil.Camille watched the water blur the city lights,transforming them into smears of color against the darkness.


She had survived Rose's betrayal. She had faced Stefan and sent him away.Now she had severed the last ties to her old life.



Camille Kane stood alone in her office, surrounded by the trappings of her new existence, the power, the prestige, the freedom to define herself on her own terms. She had won. She had reclaimed her life from those who had tried to destroy it.


Why,then,did victory taste so much like ash?


Her phone buzzed with a message from Victoria:"Dinner tonight? We should celebrate your clean break."


Camille stared at the words, realizing that while she had lost one family, she had gained another, not perfect, not traditional, but hers by choice rather than blood.


"Yes," she typed back. "I'm ready to move forward."


And as the storm outside began to subside, Camille felt something shift within her, the first tentative release of a burden she had carried for too long.Not forgiveness, not yet. But perhaps, eventually, peace.


###Chapter 78


Camille stared at the presentation on her tablet,numbers and projections swimming before her eyes.Three weeks had passed since the Phoenix Gala,since her confrontations with Stefan and her parents.The media frenzy had begun to die down, replaced by speculation about her next moves as Victoria Kane's heir and rising tech executive.



She swiped through the slides once more,trying to focus on the upcoming meeting. Kane Industries was launching its most ambitious project yet, a revolutionary clean energy system that could transform entire cities. The investment required was staggering, the risks enormous. Victoria had surprised her by putting Camille in charge of the entire operation, calling it her"graduation project."


Her office door opened, and Rebecca appeared with a concerned expression. "Ms. Kane, Mr. Pierce here.He's early."


Camille checked her watch. Twenty minutes early, to be exact. Typical Alexander, always operating on his own schedule.



"Send him in," she said, smoothing her skirt as she stood.



Alexander Pierce entered with his usual quiet confidence, dressed in a simple black suit that somehow looked more expensive than anything Stefan had ever worn. His dark eyes found hers immediately, thatpiercing gaze that always made her feel like he could see straight through her carefully constructed walls.



"You're early," she said, gesturing to the chair across from her desk.



"I wanted to see your reaction to the proposal before the formal meeting." He remained standing, hands in his pockets."Have you read it?"

"Every word. Three times." She tapped her tablet "It's ambitious."


"It's revolutionary," he corrected, moving closer."This isn't just another tech project, Camille. This could change everything, how cities function,how we approach climate change, how people live."


The passion in his voice caught her off guard.Alexander usually maintained a cool exterior, much like she did, a protective shield against a world that had taught them both harsh lessons about vulnerability.


"Victoria thinks we should proceed cautiously,"Camille said, watching his reaction. "Test the technology in smaller markets first."


Something flashed in his eyes, frustration, perhaps,or disappointment. "And what do you think?"


The question hung between them. Alexander wasn't asking about her business opinion. He was asking if she could still think for herself, if she was just Victoria's puppet or her own woman.
"I think," Camille said slowly, "that caution is what keeps you alive, but boldness is what makes you feel alive."



A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. "And which would you prefer?"


"Both have their merits." She moved to the window,looking out at the city below. "Victoria saved my life.Her caution, her planning, her strategies, they gave me a second chance when I had nothing. I owe her everything."


"You owe her respect and gratitude," Alexander said,joining her at the window. "You don't owe her your independence."


Their reflections stared back at them in the glass,two figures standing close but not touching, both shaped by pain, both transformed by their own private fires.


"Why this project?" Camille asked, turning to face him. "You have dozens of successful businesses.Why partner with Kane Industries now?"
"Because it matters,"' he said simply. "Because it's bigger than both of us. And because I think you need something to build, not just something to destroy."


His words struck a chord deep within her. The revenge that had fueled her for so long was complete. Rose was ruined. Stefan was broken. Her parents had been sent away. But the emptiness that followed victory had surprised her, a void where purpose once lived.


"The board meeting starts in fifteen minutes," she said, stepping away from him. "Victoria will expect solid numbers, not just inspiring visions."


"I have those too." Alexander moved back to the center of the room, maintaining a respectful distance. "But I wanted to speak with you privately first. This partnership isn't just between our companies. It's between us."


Camille felt a flutter of something unfamiliar in her chest, not quite fear, not quite excitement, but something in between. "What exactly are you proposing,Alexander?"
"A true collaboration. Equal partners. My resources and your vision. We've both proven we can tear things down when necessary. Now let's see what we can build together."


The air between them seemed to vibrate with possibility. In another life, Camille might have dismissed his offer immediately, retreated to the safety of Victoria's guidance. But the woman she had become, Camille Kane, was learning to trust her own instincts again.


"Why me?" she asked, the question simpler and more vulnerable than she intended. "You could partner with anyone. Why choose someone still learning the business?"


Alexander's expression softened slightly. "Because I've watched you transform from victim to victor.Because you understand what it means to lose everything and rebuild. And because you're the only person I've met who might truly comprehend why this matters so much to me."


Before she could respond, Rebecca appeared at the door. "Ms. Kane, the board is assembling in the main conference room."


"We'll be right there," Camille replied, gathering her materials.


Alexander watched her movements, his gaze thoughtful. "Whatever you decide in that room,remember this is your project now. Your future. Not Victoria's, not mine.Yours."


They walked togetherto the conference room, where Victoria waited with the full board of directors.The older woman's eyes narrowed slightly at their simultaneous arrival, but her face revealed nothing as they took their seats.


"Let's begin," Victoria said, her voice commanding immediate attention. "Mr. Pierce has proposed a partnership between Pierce Innovations and Kane Industries for what he's calling the Phoenix Grid."


Alexander stood, activating the display wall with a flick of his wrist. "Thank you for this opportunity.What I'm proposing isn't just abusiness venture, it's a complete reimagining of how cities power themseIves."


Images appeared on the screen, sleek designs for solar collection systems, wind turbines disguised as architectural elements, underground heat exchange networks.


"The Phoenix Grid combines all existing renewable technologies into one seamless system, with our proprietary Al optimizing energy flow in real-time."Alexander moved through the presentation with practiced ease. "Initial investments are high, but projected returns exceed anything currently on the market."


Victoria interrupted. "The financial risk is significant.My advisors suggest a phased approach, beginning with smaller test markets."


Alexander nodded respectfully. "A reasonable concern. However, limited implementation will limit results. The system works because it's comprehensive, each component supports the others."
The board members exchanged glances, clearly divided. Victoria turned to Camille. "As head of our tech division and project lead, what's your assessment?"


Every eye in the room turned to her. Camille felt the weight of the moment, her first major decision as Victoria's heir, her first chance to demonstrate whether she would simply echo her mentor or chart her own course.



She stood, moving to the front of the room beside Alexander. Their shoulders nearly touched as she addressed the board.



"I've reviewed Mr. Pierce's proposal extensively," she began, her voice steady. "The technology is solid.The financial models are sound. Yes, there are risks,significant ones. But there's something more important than the financial projections."


Victoria's eyebrow raised slightly, a warning,perhaps,or a test.


"This project represents exactly what Kane Industries claims to value, innovation that improves lives."Camille met Victoria's gaze directly. "We can proceed cautiously and be one more company making incremental improvements. Or we can be bold and change the world."


The room fell silent. Alexander remained perfectly still beside her, neither helping nor hindering,allowing her to stand on her own.


"What exactly are you proposing?" Victoria asked,her tone neutral.


"A full-scale implementation in one major city. NNot a test, not a pilot, the complete system." Camille activated her own presentation, showing modified projections. "I've adjusted Mr. Pierce's models to account for increased initial costs and slower adoption rates. Even with these conservative estimates, the project remains viable."


The board members leaned forward, studying the numbers with renewed interest.


"And the risk?" one of them asked. "Substantial," Camille acknowledged. "But calculated. And shared equally with Pierce Innovations."


Alexander nodded his agreement. "We're prepared to match Kane Industries' investment dollar for dollar.Equal risk, equal reward."


Victoria's expression remained unreadable as she studied Camille. Something passed between them,an understanding, perhaps, or a shift in their relationship. Mentor and protégé, but also two women who had rebuilt themselves from ashes.


"The board will need time to consider," Victoria said finally. "We'll reconvene tomorrow morning for a vote."


As the meeting adjourned, board members surrounded Alexander, asking technical questions about the proposal. Victoria motioned for Camille to follow her into a private office adjacent to the conference room.


"That was quite a presentation," Victoria said once Camille met her gaze steadily. "You asked for my assessment.I gave it."


"You contradicted me in front of the board."



"I offered a different perspective," Camille corrected gently. "Isn't that why you put me in charge of this project? To bring new ideas?"


Victoria studied her, those sharp eyes missing nothing. "Alexander Pierce is dangerous. Brilliant, but dangerous.He plays games within games."


"So do you," Camille replied. "So do l,now."


A small smile touched Victoria's lips. "Yes, you do.That's what worries me."



"You don't trust him."



"I don't trust anyone completely." Victoria moved to the window, looking out at the city below. "That's how I've survived this long. But this isn't about trust,it's about you."
"What about me?"


Victoria turned back to face her. "You've completed your revenge. Rose is destroyed. Stefan is broken.Your parents have been cast out. The fire that drove you has burned its fuel. Now you need something new to live for."


Camille felt exposed suddenly, as if Victoria had read her most private thoughts. "And you think this project with Alexander is that something?"


"I think Alexander Pierce sees in you what I saw,tremendous potential. But his motivations may not be as altruistic as they appear."


"You mean he might be using me to get to you,"Camille said.



Victoria shook her head. "No. I mean he might genuinely care for you. And that could be far more dangerous."


The words hung between them as Camille processed their meaning. Victoria wasn't worried about business rivalry, she was concerned about Camille'heart, about the possibility of new pain for someone who had already endured so much.


"I'm not the same person who fell for Stefan's charm," Camille said quietly. "I've learned to see beneath surfaces."


"Have you?" Victoria's voice held no judgment,only genuine concern. "Alexander's not Stefan. He's infinitely more complex, more careful. If he's showing you vulnerability, it's because he's chosen to."


Before Camille could respond, a knock at the door interrupted them. Alexander stood in the doorway,his expression carefully neutral.


"Excuse the interruption. The board has some additional questions about the financial structure."


Victoria nodded. "We'll continue this discussion later," she said to Camille, her tone making it clear this wasn't a request.



As Victoria left to rejoin the board, Alexander remained in the doorway, watching Camille with those perceptive eyes.


"She's warning you against me," he said, not a question but a statement.


"She's being cautious," Camille replied. "It's her nature."



"And what's your nature now, Camille Kane? Caution or boldness?"



The question echoed their earlier conversation,but with new meaning. They both knew he wasn't just talking about business strategy.


"I'm still figuring that out," she admitted.


Alexander stepped into the room, closing the distance between them. "For what it's worth, I believe in this project. But more than that, I believe in your ability to lead it."


"Why?" The question escaped before she could stop it. "Because you understand what it means to be reborn," he said simply. "To rise from destruction.This isn't just about clean energy or profit margins for me. It's about transformation, giving cities the chance to shed their old, destructive patterns and become something better."


For the first time, Camille saw beyond Alexander's carefully constructed persona, the brilliant businessman, the strategic competitor. What she glimpsed instead was someone shaped by his own private pain, someone who had also rebuilt himself from ruins.


"The Phoenix Grid," she said softly, understanding the name's significance now. "It's not just a marketing term for you."


"No," he agreed. "Just as 'Camille Kane' isn't just a name for you."


They stood in silence for a moment, each recognizing in the other a kindred spirit, someone who understood transformation from the inside out. "The board will approve the project," Camille said finally. "Victoria's concerns are valid, but the potential outweighs the risk."


"And after they approve it?" Alexander asked. "Will you truly lead it as you see fit, or will you follow Victoria's vision?"


The challenge in his voice was clear. He wasn't just offering a business partnership; he was offering her a chance to step fully into her own power, to move beyond Victoria's shadow.


"I'll lead it," Camille said, surprising herself with the certainty in her voice. "My way."


Something shifted in Alexander's expression,respect, perhaps, or satisfaction. "Then I look forward to our collaboration, Ms. Kane."


He extended his hand, and after a moment's hesitation, she took it. His grip was warm and firm,the contact sending an unexpected current up her arm.
"To new beginnings," he said quietly.


As their hands remained joined a moment longer than necessary, Camille felt something stir within her that she had thought dead forever, not just purpose or ambition, but possibility. The chance to create rather than destroy. The potential for a future defined not by what she had lost, but by what she might build.


"To new beginnings," she echoed, and for the first time in longer than she could remember, the smile that curved her lips reached her eyes.
###Chapter 79


The sunlight streaming through the windows of the Rodriguez Seattle family/ estate felt like a mockery to Stefan. Once, this light had illuminated generations of family success. Now, it merely highlighted the dust gathering on furniture that would soon belong to strangers.


Stefan sat alone in his father's study, nursing a glass of whiskey despite the early hour. The room still smelled of Eduardo's cigars and leather-bound books, a scent that had once meant security and legacy. The carved mahogany desk where his father had taught him to review shipping manifests seemed smaller now, diminished like everything else in his life.



The sound of tires on gravel jolted him from his stupor. He moved to the window, watching the black town car rol to a stop. His stomach tightened. His parents were home.


Eduardo Rodriguez emerged first, his once-commanding posture now slightly stooped. The past weeks had weathered him visibly. He helped Emily from the car with practiced tenderness, his hand at the small of her back. Stefan's mother looked thinner, her designer outfit hanging loosely where it once fit perfectly. The Italian retreat meant to shield them from the public humiliation of their family's downfall had clearly failed to provide sanctuary.


Stefan took a long swallow of whiskey, steeling himself, and strode to the foyer.


"Mother. Father." His voice echoed in the entrance hall.


Emily's eyes found his, hardening instantly. "Where is she? That woman who destroyed us?"



No greeting. No embrace. Stefan expected nothing less. Eduardo sighed heavily, passing their luggage to the remaining housemaid. "Emily, please. Let's at least sit down first."


Stefan led them to the sitting room, once the pride of his mother's decorating prowess. The crystal decanters caught the light as he poured drinks with shaking hands.


"Camille isn't here," he answered finally. "She has no reason to be."


Emily snatched the glass from his offering hand."She has every reason! To gloat, to witness our suffering. Isn't that what she wanted?"


"That's not who she is," Stefan said quietly.


"Who she is," Emily spat, "is a vengeful,manipulative...."


"Enough!" Eduardo's palm struck the side table,rattling the decanters. "Our son betrayed her, Emily.Or have you conveniently forgotten that part?"


The silence that followed felt volatile. Stefan sank into an armchair, suddenly exhausted.


"The board called an emergency meeting," Eduardo said flatly. "While we were away, they voted to accept Kane Industries' offer to purchase our remaining assets."


Stefan nodded numbly. "I know."


"You know?" Emily's voice rose. "And you did nothing to stop it?"


"What would you have me do, Mother? The debt they've acquired gives them controlling interest. It was always going to end this way."


Emily's face flushed with rage. "This estate has been in the Rodriguez family for four generations! Your great-grandfather built it with his bare hands after arriving with nothing but determination."


"And I lost it with nothing but arrogance," Stefan finished bitterly.


Eduardo moved to the window, gazing out at the gardens his wife had meticulously designed. "We have three weeks before we must vacate."



The finality of those words hung in the air like smoke.


"I tried to speak with Camille," Stefan admitted. "She wouldn't reconsider."


Emily's laugh was brittle. "Of course she wouldn't!She's Victoria Kane's puppet now. That woman has orchestrated this entire nightmare."


"No," Stefan said, meeting his mother's gaze directly."Camille orchestrated this. Victoria gave her the tools,but the vision was hers."



"And you admire her for it?" Emily's voice dripped with disbelief.


Stefan considered the question. Did he admire Camille for methodically dismantling everything he'd taken for granted? For revealing herself not as a victim but as an architect of justice?


"Yes," he said finally."I do."


Emily's glass shattered against the wall, amber liquid "This is what happens when you marry beneath you,"she hissed. "I warned you about her. She was never good enough for this family. No class, just a pretty face with ambition from a rich family."


Stefan felt something shift inside him, a quiet rage replacing the self-pity he'd wallowed in for weeks.


"Mother," he said slowly, "if anyone wasn't good enough, it was me. Camille gave everything to our marriage while I treated her as an accessory. She built herself from nothing through hard work and integrity, while I simply clung to a family name."


Emily recoiled as if slapped.


"And let's not forget," Stefan continued, "how you fawned over Rose. How you practically pushed-me into her arms with your constant praise of her sophistication, her fashion sense,her social graces."His voice grew bitter. "Her manipulation."


"Don't you dare blame your mother for your failings,"
Eduardo interjected, but his reprimand lacked conviction.


Stefan stood, suddenly unable to remain still. "I don't. The blame is entirely mine. But I won't let you rewrite history to make Camille the villain."


Emily turned away, her shoulders rigid. "She's ruined us."


"No, Mother. I ruined us. Rose helped. All Camille did was make us face the consequences."


Eduardo crossed to the bar and refilled his glass. The silence between them stretched painfully before he spoke again.


"The night before your wedding to Camille," he said quietly, "I had doubts. Not about her,about you.l wondered if you deserved her devotion." He took a measured sip. "I should have spoken them aloud."


Stefan felt the unexpected truth of those words like a physical blow.


"We still have the property in Madrid," Eduardo continued. "It's modest by our standards, but it's paid for. Your mother and I will go there next week."


"And me?" Stefan asked, though he already knew the answer.


Eduardo's expression was uncharacteristically gentle."You need to fix this."


"Eduardo!" Emily protested. "There's nothing to fix!That woman has...."


"That woman," Eduardo interrupted firmly,"has shown more backbone than anyone who's ever married into this family. If our son has any hope of salvaging his future, it lies with her."


"She won't take me back," Stefan said. "I've already tried."


"Of course she won't take you back," Eduardo scoffed. "Why would she? But there might be a path to redemption that doesn't involve reconciliation."


Emily collapsed onto the sofa, burying her face in her hands. "This is a nightmare. My son, begging for scraps from that woman's table."


"That woman," Stefan said quietly, "has a name. The same name she had when you welcomed her into this family, before you decided Rose was the superior choice."


Emily's head snapped up, her eyes flashing. "Rose was one of us! She understood our world, our obligations. She wasn't going to embarrass us at every turn, she doesn't lack refinement."


Stefan stared at his mother, truly seeing her perhaps for the first time. The shallow values, the obsession with appearances, the brittle pride masquerading as strength.


"Rose hired men to kill Camille," he said flatly."Did you know that? She paid them to attack her own sister in a parking garage and make it look like an accident."


Emily's face drained of color. "You're lying."


"She admitted it. In front of me. She wanted Camille gone so badly she was willing to have her murdered."


Eduardo slumped heavily into a chair. "Dios mío."


"So tell me again, Mother, about Rose's superior refinement."



Emily's mouth opened and closed, no words emerging.



"The irony," Stefan continued, a bitter smile twisting his lips, "is that if Rose had simply waited, she would have had everything she wanted. I gave Camille divorce papers on our anniversary and she signed it.I betrayed her, but Rose had to arranged to have her killed."



The weight of this confession seemed to press the oxygen from the room. Eduardo covered his eyes with one hand, the gesture of a man who could no longer bear to witness his son's disgrace.



"I need you to leave the estate early," Stefan said,surprising himself with the steadiness of his voice."Both of you. Take what matters and go to Madrid by the end of the week."



"You're throwing us out?" Emily's voice rose incredulously.


"I'm asking for space to do what needs to be done."Stefan moved to his father's desk and pulled out a folder containing papers he'd drafted with his remaining lawyer. "I've outlined a plan to salvage a fraction of our holdings. It won't restore our fortune,but it might preserve something of our legacy."



Eduardo took the folder with a weary nod. "And what will you do?"


Stefan looked out the window at the carefully tended gardens that had surrounded his childhood. Soon,they'd belong to strangers or, worse, be bulldozed for development. The thought should have devastated him, but instead, he felt an odd lightness.


"I'm going to help Camille," he said finally.


"Help her?" Emily sputtered. "Help her do what?

Destroy what little we have left?"
"Help her build something worthwhile." Stefan turned back to his parents. "Her Phoenix Foundation, it's going to help women trapped in abusive relationships, women who've been betrayed by those meant to protect them."


Eduardo studied his son's face. "And you think she'll accept your help?"


"Probably not. But I have to try."


Emily stood abruptly, smoothing her wrinkled traveling clothes with trembling hands. "I don't recognize you anymore."


Stefan smiled sadly. "That's because I'm finally becoming someone worth recognizing, Mother."


She turned and left the room without another word,her footsteps echoing on the marble floors.


Eduardo lingered, fatigue etched in every line of his face. "There's a fine line between atonement and self-destruction, hijo.Be careful you know which side you're on."
Stefan nodded, watching his father follow his mother upstairs. The house fell silent except for the ticking of the grandfather clock in the hallway, counting down the moments of the Rodriguez family's final days in their ancestral home.


He returned to the window, gazing out at the property that had defined him for so long. The setting sun cast long shadows across the lawn, like fingers reaching for something just beyond grasp.


Tomorrow,he would contact the Phoenix Foundation.Not to beg Camille for forgiveness, he'd attempted that already and understood its futility. Instead, he would offer the one thing he had left that might matter: his complete surrender to her cause.


She might reject him. She probably would. But in that rejection, he might find the path to becoming the man he should have been from the start, a man worthy not of possessing Camille Lewis, but of inhabiting the same world as her.


Stefan lifted his glass in a silent toast to the dying light. To endings that might, with work and grace,become beginnings of a sort.





###Chapter 80


Rose huddled in the corner booth of Café Obscura, a dingy establishment where celebrities went to be forgotten, not spotted. The hood of her oversized sweatshirt cast shadows across her face as she clutched a chipped mug of lukewarm coffee. Gone were the designer clothes and perfect makeup that had been her armor for so long.



Three weeks had passed since Camille's dramatic resurrection at the Phoenix Gala. Three weeks of hiding from reporters, dodging process servers, and watching her carefully constructed world crumble into dust. Each day brought new humiliations as her business partners abandoned her, her accounts were frozen, and her reputation dissolved in a flurry of scandalous headlines.



The bell above the café door jingled. Rose didn't look up, having learned not to make eye contact with anyone. But then a shadow fell across her table, and she sensed someone sliding into the seat opposite her.


"Ms. Lewis, I presume?" A deep voice with ahint of old money in its practiced casualness.


Rose's head snapped up, fear flooding her veins.Had they found her? Was it police? Press? The man before her was neither.



He was perhaps thirty-one, with the kind of handsome features that aged well-strong jawline,piercing gray eyes, salt-and-pepper hair cropped short. His clothes were expensive but understated.Nothing flashy, nothing that screamed wealth. But Rose had spent her life studying people with money.This man had it, and lots of it.


"Who are you?" she whispered, already calculating the distance to the exit.


"Someone with a mutual problem." He didn't offer his hand. Instead, he placed a small manila envelope on the table between them. "My name is Herod Preston."



Rose didn't touch the envelope. "How did you find me?"



A smile touched his lips but didn't reach his eyes."Finding people is a specialty of mine. Especially people who've fallen from grace."


The waitress approached, and Herod ordered black coffee without looking at the menu. After she shuffled away, Rose leaned forward.


"What do you want with me? I have nothing left to offeranyone."


"That's where you're wrong, Ms. Lewis." Herod tapped the envelope with one manicured finger. "You have something incredibly valuable: a burning hatred for Victoria Kane and her new pet project."


Rose's breath caught in her throat. Her fingers curled into fists beneath the table. With trembling hands,she pulled the envelope toward her and peeked inside. Photographs. The first showed a younger Victoria Kane standing beside a beautiful young woman with golden hair. The next showed the same young woman with a handsome man in his thirties,his arm around her waist.



"My brother," Herod explained, his voice suddenly tight. "Charles Preston."


Rose looked up sharply. "Preston... as in Preston Shipping Lines?"


Herod nodded once. "The very same. Once the third largest shipping empire in the world." His jaw tightened. "Before Victoria Kane decided to destroy us."



The waitress returned with his coffee. He didn't touch it.



"I don't understand," Rose said, though a cold feeling of recognition was spreading through her chest.



"Ten years ago, my brother was engaged to Sophia Kane," Herod began, his voice low and controlled.
"Victoria's daughter. Our families weren't exactly thrilled. Old rivalries, competing interests. My father particularly opposed the match."


Rose studied the photograph again. The couple looked happy, their smiles genuine. "What happened?"


Pain flashed across Herod's face, quickly masked."There was an accident. Sophia's car went off the road on a rainy night. She diedinstantly."


Rose remembered Victoria's words at the gala: *My daughter was taken from me through treachery and lies. I know the pain of loss better than most.*


"Victoria blamed your family?"


Herod's laugh was hollow. "Victoria didn't just blame us, she crucified us. Within a year of Sophia's death,Kane Industries had leveraged us out of every major shipping lane. Within two years, our stock was worthless. Within three, my father had drunk himself to death, and my brother..." His voice faltered."Charles couldn't live with the guilt and grief. He took his own life on the anniversary of Sophia's death."


Rose tried to swallow but found her mouth dry. "Why are you telling me this?"


Herod leaned forward, his eyes suddenly alive with intensity. "Because history is repeating itself. Victoria Kane has found herself a new daughter to replace the one she lost. And once again, she's using that daughter as a weapon to destroy anyone who stands in her way."


The truth of his words struck Rose like a physical blow. "Camille," she whispered.


"Yes. Your sister. The woman you wronged." Herod's gaze was piercing. "The woman who is now systematically dismantling your life piece by piece,just as Victoria once dismantled mine."


For weeks since the gala, Rose had been reeling from the revelation that Camille was not only alive but had been systematically destroying everything Rose had built. The coordinated attacks on her reputation, her business, her relationships, all orchestrated by the sister she thought she'd eliminated.


"The Phoenix Gala," Rose murmured, the humiliation of that night washing over her anew. "Camille standing there, revealing herself to everyone. All this time,she was plotting with Victoria Kane."


"Yes, quite the dramatic resurrection," Herod agreed."Victoria has always had a flair for the theatrical.A fitting phoenix story, wouldn't you say?"


Rose's stomach twisted with nausea. She remembered the men she'd hired to scare Camille, to send a message. They had clearly failed, and Victoria Kane had somehow found Camille afterward.



"I didn't mean for her to die," Rose whispered, more to herself than to Herod. "I just wanted her gone."


"And now she's back to ensure you suffer the same fate.Unless we stop her."


Rose's head snapped up. "We?"


"Victoria Kane destroyed my family because she believed we took something precious from her. Now, she's using your sister to do the same to you."Herod's voice was even, reasonable. "I've spent years rebuilding what Victoria took from the Prestons. I have resources, connections.What I need is someone who knows Camille, her weaknesses,her pressure points."①



"And what exactly are you proposing?" Rose asked,caution warring with desperate hope.


"Victoria has made Camille into a weapon. But even the most carefully crafted weapons have flaws in their design."


"You want to hurt her?" Rose asked, surprised by the protective instinct that flared despite everything.


"I want to separate her from Victoria's influence,"Herod clarified. "Victoria Kane is using your sister as her personal weapon, but she's also Victoria's greatest weakness."



"What are you suggesting?"


"I'm suggesting we join forces." Herod's voice dropped lower. "Victoria destroyed my family because of her daughter. Now she's found a replacement in Camille, and together they've devastated your life. They've both earned our vengeance."


Rose studied him, calculating. "You want to hurt Camille to get to Victoria?"


"I want to destroy them both," Herod said flatly."Victoria took everything from me. And Camille.." He gestured at Rose's disheveled appearance. "Well, I believe you have your own score to settle with your sister."



Rose felt a rush of dark satisfaction at his directness.Finally,someone who understood the depth of her hatred without judgment.


Herod placed a business card on the table beside the photographs. "Think about it. You've lost everything,Ms. Lewis. Your business, your reputation, your fiancé. But you haven't lost your intelligence or your instinct for survival." He buttoned his jacket with practiced ease. "Call that number when you're ready to fight back."


He moved toward the door, then paused,looking back at her with an inscrutable expression.


"One more thing," he said. "Victoria believes my family arranged Sophia's death. That's why she destroyed us." The muscle in his jaw tightened. "She was right."


Before Rose could process this confession, Herod was gone, the bell above the door marking his exit.


Rose sat frozen, the business card clutched in her trembling fingers, the photographs spread before her. Her mind raced with possibilities, with plans,with understanding. For weeks since the Phoenix Gala, she'd been running, hiding, licking her wounds.Now she understood the full scope: Victoria Kane had been the architect behind Camille's transformation, teaching her how to engineer Rose's downfall with surgical precision.


Outside, the evening air was cool against her flushed skin. For the first time in weeks, Rose stood straight, no longer hunching to avoid recognition. A plan was forming in her mind, nebulous but growing clearer by the moment.


Victoria Kane and Camille hadtaken everything from her. But Rose knew Camille better than anyone, her fears, her insecurities, the weak points in her armor.And now, with Herod's resources and insider knowledge about Victoria, they could strike back where it would hurt most.


Rose hailed a taxi, her decision made. She would call Herod Preston. Together, they would devise a plan to bring down both Victoria and Camille.



"You think you've won," Rose whispered to the night air, imagining Camille's face. "But I'm not finished yet.Not even close."


As the taxi pulled away from the curb, Rose's fingers closed around the business card in her pocket. A small smile tugged at her lips, the first genuine one in weeks. The game wasn't over yet. It had only just begun.
###Chapter 81

Camille's phone buzzed on her nightstand, pulling her from a dreamless sleep. The screen glowed with Alexander's name. Not a text message, but an actual call at, she squinted, 5:36 AM.

"Hello?" Her voice was rough with sleep.

"Look out your window." Alexander's voice held an energy that made her sit up straight.

"It's not even dawn," she protested, but was already moving to the floor-to-ceiling glass that showcased the Manhattan skyline.

"East. Toward the water,"

Camille pressed her forehead against the cool glass, eyes searching the horizon where night was reluctantly giving way to morning. "What am I looking for?"

"Wait for it."

As if on cue, the first ray of sunlight broke across the water, igniting the glass towers of the financial district in gold and fire. But it wasn't just the buildings that caught the light. An enormous structure floated in the harbor, a ship unlike any Camille had seen before. Its vast deck gleamed with what appeared to be thousands of mirrored panels catching the sunrise.

"Is that...."

"RISING EX WIFE. My company's first fully solar-powered cargo vessel." Pride shimmered in Alexander's voice. "She dropped anchor twenty minutes ago after her maiden voyage from Rotterdam. Zero emissions.Zero fossil fuels."

Camille stared at the vessel, understanding immediately what this meant for their Phoenix Grid project. "You didn't tell me it was ready."
"Some surprises are worth keeping." A pause. "Get dressed. I'm sending a heficopter to the roof in thirty minutes. Bring shoes you don't mind getting wet."

Before she could respond, the line went dead.

Victoria would disapprove, Camille thought as she showered quickly. This kind of impulsivity wasn't in the careful script they'd crafted for Camille Kane's public persona. But as warm water cascaded over her shoulders, Camille realized she didn't care what Victoria would think. For the first time in two years,she wanted to make a choice simply because it felt right.

The helicopter touched down exactly thirty minutes later. Alexander waited inside, dressed in worn jeans and a light sweater, looking nothing like the billionaire CEO the world knew. The silver rose pendant she'd returned to her at their dinner hung around her neck, a small weight against her collarbone.

"You're going to upend the entire shipping industry with this,"Camille said as they lifted off, gesturing toward the gleaming vessel growing larger as they approached.

"We're going to upend it," Alexander corrected. "RISING EX WIFE is just the beginning. With the Phoenix Grid providing charging stations in every major port, we'll make dirty shipping obsolete within a decade."

The confidence in his voice stirred something in Camille, not the cold, calculated determination that had driven her revenge, but something warmer, more vital. This was creation, not destruction. Building, not tearing down.

They landed on the massive ship's helipad, where a small group of engineers waited to greet them. As Alexander made introductions, Camille noticed something unusual about the team, their easy camaraderie with him, the absence of the typical deference shown to billionaire CEOs, the way they rolled their eyes at his technical questions.

"You worked on this personally," she realized aloud.

Alexander's cheeks flushed slightly. "I have a degree in engineering most people don't know about. This project was too important to delegate entirely."

One of the engineers, a woman with steel-gray hair and weathered hands, snorted. "He means he drove us crazy for three years, sleeping in the lab and redoing our calculations at 3 AM."
They toured the vessel from bow to stern. Alexander explained how the flexible solar panels that covered the deck could capture energy even in cloudy conditions, how the hydrogen fueI cells stored power for nighttime sailing, how the Al navigation system optimized routes based on weather patterns to maximize efficiency.

"It's revolutionary," Camille said as they stood at the ship's bow, the Manhattan skyline spread before them."But the cost must be astronomical. How will shipping companies afford to convert their fleets?"

Alexander's eyes sparkled with something that looked like mischief. "They won't have to.... we'll do it for them."

"What do you mean?"

"I've created a separate foundation with five billion in initial funding. We'll convert existing cargo ships to solar at no cost to the companies, in exchange for a small percentage of their increased profits for five years.After that, the technology belongs to them completely."

Camille stared at him. "That's... that's not how business usually works."

"Maybe it should be." Alexander turned to face her fully. "Some innovations are too important to be held hostage by traditional profit models. Climate change won't wait for quarterly earnings reports."

Something shifted in Camille's chest, a recognition of the man standing before her. Not the calculated helper who had assisted her revenge, not the powerful CEO, but someone who had taken his own pain and transformed it into something that would heal rather than hurt.

"You're not who I thought you were," she said softly.

"Neither are you." His gaze was steady. "Camille Lewis had compassion that saved a stranger on a dark road. Camille Kane has the power to reshape industries. I'm interested in the woman who combines both."

The morning sun had fully risen now, bathing them in light that felt almost too bright, too revealing.Camille turned away, overwhelmed by the intensity in his eyes.

"Come on,",Alexander said, sensing her discomfort. "There's one more thing I want to show you."
He led her to asmall cabin tucked away from the bridge. Inside, a simple desk held a oomputer and a framed photograph. Camile recognized Alexander, several years younger, standing beside a petite woman with kind eyes.

"This was Ruth Chen," he said, touching the frame gently. "The engineer who developed the original flexible solar technology we're using. She died of cancer three years ago, before she could see her work implemented. Her last request was that we name the first vessel after her favorite childhood book."

"RISING EX WIFE BY ANNYPEN" Camille murmured.

"A ship that sails to the edge of the world and beyond." Alexander's voice was quief. "Ruth believed innovation should serve humanity, not just shareholders. The week before she died, she made me promise that when this ship finally sailed, I'd remember why we were building it, not for profit or prestige, but because it was right."

Camille felt tears pricking her eyes, unexpected and unwelcome. She blinked them away.that why you were so determined to help me? Because it was right?"

Alexander considered this, then shook his head. "No. I helped you because | owed you a debt. But somewhere along the way, it became about more than that."

"What did it become about?" Camille's heart hammered in her chest.

Instead of answering directly, Alexander opened a drawer and removed a worn leather journal. "Ruth kept this during the development process. Her technical notes, but also her philosophy." He handed it to Camille."Page seventy-three."

Camille carefully opened the journal to the marked page, where a single paragraph had been highlighted:

*True power isn't in what we take from others, but in what we create. Destruction is easy, a match can burn down a forest in hours that took centuries to grow. But creation? Creation is the real magic. It requires faith that what doesn't yet exist can be brought into being through persistence and vision."

Camille's hand trembled slightly as she closed the journal."Why are you showing me this?"

"Because you stand at a crossroads." Alexander's voice was gentle but firm. "Your revenge is complete.
Rose and Stefan are destroyed. Your parents are cut from your life. Victoria has given you everything she promised. But now comes the harder part."

"What's that?"

"Deciding who you want to be when you're not defined by what was done to you." He took the journal and returned it to the drawer. "Ruth taught me that our greatest power lies not in defeating enemies, but in creating something they could never imagine."

Camille walked to the cabin's small window, watching seagulls wheel above the water. "Victoria would say you're trying to manipulate me."

"Victoria transformed your pain into a weapon. I'm suggesting you transform it into something else."

"Like what?"

Alexander moved to stand beside her, close but not touching. "The Phoenix Foundation you announced at the gala, it could be more than just a symbolic gesture. You could build something that helps women rebuild after betrayal, that creates real protection and opportunity."

"With your help, I assume?" Camille couldn't keep the edge from her voice.

"With or without me. That's your choice." Alexander's eyes held hers. "But I'd like it to be with me."

The directness of his statement caught her off guard."Why?"

"Because I've spent five years watching you from a distance, first with gratitude, then with concern,then with admiration. Because I've never met anyone who could walk through fire and emerge stronger. Because when I'm with you, I remember that business and power are means, not ends."

He stepped closer, still not touching her. "And because when you look at me, you see Alexander, not the Pierce fortune or the company legacy. Just as I see Camille, not the woman who saved me or the avenger Victoria created."

The cabin suddenly felt too small, too intimate. Camille moved past him to the door."I need to think."

"I know." Alexander didn't try to stop her. "Take all the time you need."
Back on the deck, Camille breathed deeply, trying to steady herself. New York gleamed in the morning light,its towers reaching toward the sky like ambitions made concrete and glass.

The helicopter pilot approached, asking if she was ready to return to the city. Camille hesitated, looking back toward the cabin where Alexander remained.

"Ms. Kane?" the pilot prompted.

"Not yet," she said, surprising herself. "I have something to discuss with Mr. Pierce first."

As she walked back toward the cabin, Camille felt the weight of the silver rose pendant against her skin,a small reminder of who she had been before pain and betrayal, before revenge and rebirth. Not a blueprint to follow, but a foundation to build upon.

She paused at the cabin door, her hand on the handle, aware that whatever choice she made now would shape not just her relationship with Alexander, buut the woman she would become after the flames of revenge had cooled.

Camille took a deep breath and opened the door.
###Chapter 82

The cabin door opened with a soft click. Alexander looked up from Ruth's journal, his fingers still resting on the worn leather cover. His expression shifted from surprise to something more guarded, hope held carefully in check.

Camille stood in the doorway, backlit by the morning sun. The ocean breeze had loosened strands of her hair from its perfect arrangement, giving her a wildness that contradicted the careful image she'd maintained since her transformation. She stepped inside, letting the door close behind her.

"I sent the helicopter back," she said, her voice steadier than she felt.

Alexander set the journal aside. "You're staying?"

"For now." Camille moved further into the cabin, noticing the small details she'd missed before, the coffee mug with a chipped rim, the wrinkled shirt hanging by the tiny bathroom, the scattered notes in Alexander's handwriting. Signs of actual living, not just performing.

The silence between them stretched, filled with unspoken questions.

"The view from the bow is incredible," she finally said. "You can see the whole city. All those buildings, all those lives. From here, they look so small."

"Perspective changes everything." Alexander remained seated, giving her space.

Camille touched the silver rose pendant at her throat. "When I was little, I used to imagine who l might become. A doctor, a teacher, an astronaut. Normal dreams." Her mouth curved in a sad smile. "Then I became Stefan's wife. Then Rose's victim. Then Victoria's creation."

"And now?" Alexander asked quietly.

"Now I want to be someone new." The words felt strange on her tongue,frightening and liberating all at  once. "Someone who makes her own name, not just wears someone else's."

Alexander's face remained calm, but his knuckles whitened slightly as his hands gripped the edge of the desk. "What does that look like for you?"

Camille turned to the window, watching the waves catch sunlight. "I don't know exactly. But I know what it doesn't look like." She took a deep breath. "It doesn't look like spending my life feeding a hunger for revenge that never gets satisfied. It doesn't look like measuring my worth by how successfully I destroy others."

She faced him again."When I was in that parking garage, bleeding and broken, I thought I'd lost everything.Victoria showed me I was wrong, I'd lost things, but not everything. Not myself."

"She gave you a path," Alexander acknowledged.

"Yes. A path of fire." Camille's voice grew stronger. "But fire does two things, it destroys and it transforms.I've done enough destroying. I want to transform now."

Alexander stood, his movements careful, measured, as if approaching something precious and easily startled. "The Phoenix Foundation you announced, it could be real, not just a public relations move.Something that actually helps women rebuild after betrayal."

"Not just women," Camille said, surprising herself. "Anyone who's been discarded, anyone who's been told they're nothing after giving everything. People like I was. People like you were, alone in that hospital."

The words hung between them,raw and honest.

"It won't be easy," Alexander said. "Building something meaningful never is."
0
"I know." Camille's fingers nervously traced the edge of Ruth Chen's photograph on the desk. "Victoria won't understand. She might see it as weakness, as forgetting wvhat Rose did to me."

"What will you tell her?"

"That Rose tried to murder my body, but staying consumed by hate would murder my soul." Camille's voice cracked slightly. "That I'm done letting her destroy any more of my life."
Alexander took a single step closer. "You'll still run Kane Industries?"

"The tech division, yes. Victoria gave me that." A hint of steel entered Camille's voice. "I earned it. And I'l use it to build the grid, to fund the foundation, to create something lasting."

"And Rose and Stefan?"

Camille's jaw tightened. "They've lost everything. They'll face legal consequences for what they did. But l won't spend another day thinking about them. They're just... done."

The weight of her words seemed to physically lighten her. She stood taller, breathed deeper.

"l want to help," Alexander said simply. "In whatever way you'll let me."

"Why?" The question was direct, without Victoria's trained suspicion or Camille Lewis's naive trust. Just a woman asking for truth.

Alexander's eyes never left hers. "Because l've spent years watching you from a distance,first with gratitude, then with worry, then with admiration. Because I've never met anyone who could walk through such darkness and still carry light inside them."

He moved closer until barely a foot separated them. "Because the woman who sat with a stranger in a hospital room is the same woman who stands here now, finally free to decide who she wants to be."

Camille felt heat rise to her cheeks. "You make me sound better than l am."

"No." Alexander shook his head. "I just see what you've been too hurt to remember."

The ship swayed gently beneath them, a living thing carrying them forward. Through the window,Camille could see the horizon line where sky met water, clean and sharp as a fresh start.

"I'll help you," Alexander continued. "Every step, in any way you need. But only if that's what you want."

Camille studied his face, the sincerity in his eyes, the tension in his jaw, the careful way he held himself,offering without demanding. She'd forgotten what it felt like to be offered something with no debt attached.

"Yes," she whispered. Then stronger: "Yes.I want your help."
The word hung between them, an offering, not a surrender.

Alexander's shoulders relaxed, a smile breaking across his face like sunrise. "Then we'll build something extraordinary together."

He held out his hand, palm up, not grabbing, just offering connection. Camille looked at it for a long moment before placing her hand in his. His fingers were warm, solid, his grip gentle but secure.

"I should warn you," she said, a hint of humor in her voice, "I have no idea what I'm doing. All my plans ended with revenge."

"That's the beautiful part." Alexander's thumb moved gently across her knuckles."You get to discover what comes next. And speaking as someone who watched you systematically dismantle two empires, I'm fairly confident you can handle building a new one."

The touch of his hand grounded her, steadied her against the vertigo of possibility. But it was his words that reached deeper, past the armor Victoria had helped her build, past the wounds Rose had inflicted,past the love Stefan had withdrawn. For the first time in years, someone saw her, not what she could give them or do for them, but her.

"I'm scared," she admitted, the words barely audible.

"Good." Alexander's voice held no judgment. "Fear means you're doing something that matters."

A knock at the cabin door broke the moment. One of the engineers stood there, awkwardly holding a tablet."Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Pierce, but we've got some anomalous readings from the starboard cells. Might be nothing,but...."

"I'll be right there," Alexander said, releasing Camille's hand reluctantly.

The engineer nodded and disappeared, leaving them alone again.

"Duty calls," Camille said.

"Unfortunately." Alexander hesitated. "Have dinner with me tonight. Not as Kane Industries and Pierce Enterprises. Just as Camille and Alexander."
The invitation seemed to hang in the air between them, weighted with possibility.

"I'd like that," Camille said, surprised by how much she meant it.

Alexander's smile deepened. "I'Il send a car at eight."

He moved toward the door, then paused, turning back."Camille?"

"Yes?"

"Whatever you decide to build, whoever you decide to become,it will be magnificent."

The door closed behind him, leaving Camille alone in the cabin. She touched the silver rose pendant again,feeling its cool weight against her skin. Outside, the ocean stretched toward infinity, constantly changing yet somehow eternal.

She thought of Rose, plotting revenge with Herod Preston. Of Stefan, facing the ruins of his legacy. Of Victoria, who had given her the tools for destruction but perhaps not the vision for creation.①

None of them had imagined this moment, this possibility. None of them had seen that after the flames of revenge burned out, something new could rise from the ashes.

Camille walked to the cabin door and stepped out onto the deck. The wind immediately caught her hair,pulling it completely free from its careful arrangement. She didn't fix it. Instead, she lifted her face to the sun,feeling its warmth seep into her skin.

Far above, seagulls wheeled against the blue sky, their cries carrying across the water. The massive solar panels that covered the ship's deck captured the sunlight, transforming it into power, into movement, into future.

Transformation, not destruction.

Creation, not revenge.

For thefirst time since that night in the parking garage, Camille felt something unfamiliar expanding in her chest,not satisfaction or vindication or even triumph. Something quieter but infinitely more powerful.
Hope.

Not hope tethered to another person's love or approval. Not hope pinned to seeing enemies suffer. But hope rooted in possibility, in becoming, in the dawn of something entirely new.

Camille Lewis had died in that parking garage.

Camille Kane had risen for revenge.

But the woman standing on this ship, face to the sun, hands open to the future, she was just beginning to lve.
###Chapter 83

The late afternoon sun slanted through the tall windows of the Lewis family estate, casting long shadows across the polished floors. Margaret Lewis sat alone in the east wing parlor, surrounded by open photo albums. Her trembling fingers traced a photograph of seven-year-old Camille, beaming with a missing front tooth and holding a science fair ribbon.

"First place," Margaret whispered to the empty room, her smile crumpling.

She turned a page. Camille at ten, sitting with Margaret on marble steps, their heads bent over"The Secret Garden." Margaret remembered how Camille had begged to read two ###Chapters that night.

The memories washed over her in waves. These were all from before Rose had arrived when Camille was thirteen. Before everything changed.

With shaking hands, she pulled out a photo tucked between pages: Camille at ten in the kitchen with Margaret, making Christmas cookies despite the chef's protests. Flour dusted their faces, laughter frozen in time. They had been inseparable then.

"We were happy," Margaret said to the photograph. "We were so happy."

She hadn't realized she was crying until a tear splashed onto the plastic sleeve. Margaret wiped it away carefully, then pressed the album to her chest.

The fifteen-thousand-square-foot mansion felt too vast now, too quiet. Since the day the visited Camille and she cut ties with them, Margaret had moved through each day like a ghost.

Richard's voice echoed in the hallway as he spoke to Bradford, their butler.

"No calls, Bradford. Not even from the board."

"Very good, sir. Shall I have Mrs. Peters prepare dinner for two in the small dining room?"
"That would be fine. And tell her no seafood tonight. Margaret isn't up to it."

Margaret turned another page. Camille at fourteen, playing the grand piano at her recital.

Richard's footsteps approached, then stopped in the doorway.

"Oh, Maggie," he said softly, using the nickname he hadn't spoken in years.

Margaret lookedd up at her husband. His bespoke suit couldn't hide how his frame had thinned, his shoulders slumped. His face seemed to have aged a decade in the past month, deep lines carved around his mouth.

"Look at us," Margaret said, holding up a family vacation photo. "She was twelve here. Remember how she wanted to learn to scuba dive, and you were so worried?"

Richard knelt beside her, taking the photo.

"She went anyway," he said, a ghost of a smile crossing his face. "Came back with that certification and told me I worried too much."

"She was right. We should have worried less about the wrong things."

Richard picked up another photo: Camille on her first day of college.

"I thought she was making a mistake choosing Boston instead of Yale. I told her she was throwing away opportunities." He shook his head. "She was following her heart, and I couldn't see it."

Margaret gathered more photos: Camille winning debate tournaments, volunteering at the animal shelter,laughing with friends at graduation.

"She was always so good, Richard. So kind." Margaret's hands shook. "And we just... we just stopped seeing her.How did that happen? When did we stop seeing our daughter?"

Richard picked up a more recent photo, Camille and Stefan at their engagement party. Rose stood beside them,smiling that perfect smile that had fooled them all.

"We saw what we wanted to see," he said. "Rose was so... perfect on the surface. She said all the right things, did all the right things. She moved through our world like she was born to it."
"Not like Camille," Margaret whispered. "Who was messy and real and questioned everything. Who didn't care about appearing in the society pages or impressing the right people."

"We failed her." Richard's voice broke. "Our own daughter, and we chose a stranger over her."

Margaret closed her eyes, remembering Camille's face at Kane Industries three weeks ago, cold and distant.

"Do you think she'll ever forgive us? Ever come back home?"

Richard didn't answer immediately. He gathered several scattered photos, looking at each one with pain.

"I don't know," he said honestly. "The things we said to her when she tried to tell us about Rose and Stefan...The way we doubted her, accused her of jealousy and lying..."

"We can apologize," Margaret said desperately. "We can make it right."

"We already tried that at her office. She looked at us like we were shareholders asking for a dividend report.Like we meant nothing to her."

Fresh tears spilled down Margaret's cheeks. "That's not our Camille. Victoria Kane has turned her into someone else."

"NO,"Richard said. "Our Camille died the night Rose tried to have her killed. The woman we met at Kane Industries, that's who our daughter had to become to survive what was done to her. What was done to her while we sided with her abusers."

Margaret flinched but couldn't deny the truth. She reached for a photo from Camille's wedding to Stefan.The three of them stood together, with Rose visible at the edge,watching.

"Look how Rose is looking at her, even then. How did we not see it?"

"Because we didn't want toRichard admitted. "Rose was the daughter we thought we wanted, agreeable,socially perfect. Camille was always her own person, messy and real and... so much stronger than we ever gave her credit for."

Margaret sorted through more photos. So many pictures of Camille until age eleven, riding horses,reading books, winning awards, making silly faces. Then, after Rose came, the images changed dramatically.Fewer candid shots, more posed photos at charity events where Camille's smile didn't reach her eyes.

"We lost her long before that night in the parking garage," Margaret realized. "We lost her starting the day Rose arrived. It happened bit by bit, every time we chose Rose's version over hers. Every time we praised Rose's perfect manners while criticizing Camille."

Richard nodded. "And now she belongs to Victoria Kane."

"Do you think Victoria loves her? Actually loves her, not just uses her?"

"I don't know if Victoria Kane is capable of love the way we understand it. But she saw value in Camille when we failed to. She gave her purpose, power, a new identity when her old one was shattered."

"Because of Rose." Margaret's hands curled into fists."Our 'perfect' daughter who tried to have our real daughter killed."④

"I keep thinking about that summer when Camille was ten,"Margaret said after a silence. "She broke her arm falling from her horse, and I slept in her room for a week. It was the last time I truly mothered her."

"She would wake up, and I would tell her stories until she fell back asleep. She always wanted to hear about brave girls who fought dragons or solved mysteries. Never princesses waiting to be rescued."

"She never needed rescuing," Richard said. "Until she did, and we weren't there."

"What do we do, Richard? How do we live with this?"

Richard looked around the room, at the mansion that had housed Lewis generations. His gaze settled on the grand piano in the corner, untouched since Camille had last played it.

"We start by facing the truth," he said. "About Rose. About ourselves. About what we allowed to happen."

"And then?"

"Then we try to become the parents she deserved. Not to win her back, she may never want us in her life again. But because it's right."

Margaret looked at a photo of Camille at five, sitting in her lap as they read together.
"Will she ever come home?" she asked, her voice breaking.

"1 don't know," Richard said honestly. "This may not be her home anymore. Victoria Kane's mansion, Kane Industries, that may be where she belongs now."

"I can't accept that," Margaret whispered fiercely.

"Then don't. Fight for her. Not by pushing into her life where we're not wanted, but by becoming people worthy of her forgiveness."

Margaret looked at the scattered evidence of the daughter they had failed.

"It might be too late," she said.

"It might be," Richard agreed. "But Camille never gave up on the things that mattered to her. If she got that from anyone, she got it from you."

Margaret carefully closed the album, her fingers lingering on the embossed family crest. The room had grown darker as the sun set.

"She won't come back to us as she was," Margaret said finally. "That Camille is gone. But maybe, someday the woman she's become might find room in her life for the parents we shouId have been."

Richard helped her to her feet. Margaret placed the photo album on the mahogany shelf, alongside dozens of others.

"I'm going to write to her," Margaret decided. "Not asking for forgiveness. Not yet. Just...letting her know that we're here. That we see her now. Really see her."

Outside, darkness had fallen. Bradford silently appeared to inform them dinner was served. The mansion felt hollow, each opulent room haunted by absences and mistakes. But as Margaret looked at the photos one last time, she felt something shift inside her, not forgiveness, not yet, but perhaps the first step toward earning it.

"One day at a time," she whispered. "One truth at a time."

It wasn't the promise of her daughter's return. But for tonight, in a house emptied of certainties but filled with wealth that suddenly meant nothing,it was somewhere to begin.
###Chapter 84

Rain pounded against the windows of Kane Industries as Camille reviewed the quarterly reports for the Phoenix Grid project. The soft glow of her desk lamp created a bubble of light in the darkening office.Most employees had gone home hours ago, but Camille found comfort in the solitude of these late hours.Here, in the quiet, she could focus on creation rather than destruction.

Her phone buzzed with a text from Alexander: *Still working? The world won't change in a single night.*

A smile tugged at her lips. She typed back: *Says the man who probably hasn't left his lab yet.*

Three dots appeared, then: *Guilty. Dinner tomorrow?*

Before she could respond, a sharp knock echoed through her office. Camille glanced up, expecting her assistant with the financial projections she'd requested.

Instead,Rose stood in the doorway.

Time seemed to slow as their eyes locked. Rose looked different-thinner, harder. Dark circles shadowed her eyes. Her designer clothes had been replaced by a plain black sweater and jeans. But the hatred blazing in her gaze remained unchanged.

"Security didn't mention you were coming," Camille said, her voice steady despite the sudden hammering of her heart.

Rose's lips curled into a bitter smile. "Money still opens doors, sister dear. Even when most of it's gone."

She stepped into the office uninvited, her movements jerky with barely contained rage. Rain dripped from her coat onto the polished floor. The door swung shut behind her with a soft click that sounded unnervingly final.

"What do you want, Rose?" Camille asked, rising from her chair. She wouldn't give Rose the advantage of looking down at her.

"What do I want?" Rose laughed, the sound brittle and sharp as breaking glass. "That's rich coming from you.I want back everything you stole from me."

"I didn't steal anything from you. I took back what was mine."

Rose's face contorted. "Nothing was ever yours! You were just holding it for me until I was ready to take it."

The raw honesty of the statement hung between them. No more pretense, no more masks. Just the ugly truth that had always lurked beneath their relationship.

"So you admit it," Camille said quietly. "You never saw me as your sister. Just someone whose life you could steal when it suited you."

"You had everything handed to you," Rose spat, taking another step forward. "The perfect parents. The perfect house. The perfect life. I had to claw my way out of the foster system, waiting for someone....anyone..... to want me. And then I saw your family with their big house and their perfec daughter.I made them choose me. I made them love me more."

Rain lashed against the windows, punctuating her words with angry bursts.

"And it was so easy," Rose continued, her voice dropping to a near whisper. "So pathetically easy to make them see you as less. To make them question you. To make them choose me over and over again."

Camille absorbed the cruelty of these words, feeling them strike against an old wound that had finally begun to heal. The old Camille would have crumbled, would have begged for understanding. But that woman was gone.

"Did you come here just to tell me what I already know?" Camille asked, keeping her voice level. "Or did you have something else in mind?"

Rose's hand slipped into her pocket. "I came to promise you something."

The movement set off alarms in Camille's mind. She tensed, ready to call security or defend herself if necessary.
But Rose didn't pull out a weapon. Instead, she withdrew a small silver object and placed it on the desk between them. A worn photograph of Camille's childhood bedroom, torn in half.

"Remember this place?" Rose asked, her voice eerily calm.

Camille didn't touch it. The photo brought back unwanted memories, the room she'd decorated with such care, the space that had been hers before Rose had gradually taken it over with her opinions and presence.

"You've kept that all this time?" Camille asked, keeping her expression neutral.

Rose's smile widened. "I keep all my trophies. And now l've come to tell you..... you haven't won. You've just started a war that I intend to finish."

that what this is? A threat?" Camille asked.

that what this is? A threat?"

"Apromise," Rose corrected, leaning forward with her palms flat on the desk. "You took everything from me,Camille. My reputation. My business. Stefan." She spat his name like a curse. "You even took our parents. All because you couldn't handle that he chose me over you."

Camille shook her head, refusing to be baited. "You tried to have me killed, Rose."

"A mistake," Rose said dismissively. "I only wanted to scare you into leaving. Those idiots went too far."

"And you're making another mistake now."

Rose straightened, studying Camille with narrowed eyes. "You think you've won. That's your mistake.You've taken everything that mattered to me, so now I have nothing left to lose." She tapped the Preston pin. "But you? You've built a whole new life. New mother. New company. New boyfriend." Her lips curved into a cruel smile. "So many new thngs to take from you."

The threat hung in the air between them, raw and vicious. For a moment, Camille felt the old fear stirring,the helpless panic of being outmaneuvered by Rose once again. But she pushed it aside, refusing to give it power.

"I'm not that woman anymore, Rose," Camille said quietly. "The one who trusted you. The one who believed your lies. The one who could be manipulated and used. I buried her."

"And rose from the ashes as Camille Kane," Rose mocked. "How poetic. But you're still the same underneath. Still desperate to be loved. Still afraid of being alone. I've always seen right through you, sister.Always wwill."

Camille walked around the desk, closing the distance between them. Rose instinctively stepped back, a flicker of uncertainty crossing her face.

"You never saw me at all," Camille said. "That was your mistake. You were so busy planning how to use me that you never bothered to know me. If you had, you'd realize that threatening me now is pointless."

"Is it?" Rose challenged, though her voice had lost some of its edge.

"I've alréady faced the worst you could do to me," Camille said. "You took my husband, my family, and tried to take my life. I rebuilt everything from nothing. What could you possibly do that would frighten me now?"

A flash of something, frustration, maybe even a hint of respect crossed Rose's face before hardening again into hate.

"You'll find out," she promised. "When everything you've built comes crashing down around you, when everyone you care about turns away, when you're left with nothing but ashes, then you'll understand what you've done."

that what this is about for you?" Camille asked, genuine curiosity in her voice. "Making me understand?"

"It's about justice," Rose snapped.

"Justice," Camille repeated, letting out a soft, disbelieving laugh. "You tried to murder me, Rose. After systematically destroying every relationship in my life. What exactly do you think you deserve justice for?"

Rose's face flushed with angry color. "For being exposed. For being humiliated. For having everything taken from me."

"Everything you took from me first," Camille pointed out.

"It wasn't yours to begin with!" Rose shouted, her composure finally cracking. "None of it was! Not Stefan, not our parents' love, not your perfect life! You were just a placeholder until I came along!"

The raw pain in her voice caught Camille off guard.Beneath the rage and threats lay a well of hurt so deep it seemed bottomless, the wounded child from the foster system who believed she had to steal love because she'd never receive it freely.

For a brief moment, Camille felt something dangerously close to pity. Then she remembered the men in the parking garage. The flash of their knives. The darkness closing in as she bled onto the concrete.

"Get out, Rose," she said softly. "Go back to Hell hole and plot whatever revenge you think will heal you. But know this-I'm not afraid of you anymore. Neither is Victoria. And if you come after either of us, you'll find we're much harder to destroy than you think."

Rose stared at her, chest heaving with emotion. For a second, Camille thought she might lunge forward,might try to harm her physically. Instead, she snatched the torn photo from the desk and backed toward the door.

"This isn't over," Rose said, her voice tight with fury. "Not by a long shot. I'm going to take everything from you,Camille.Your company.Your new mother. Your boyfriend. I'll make you watch as I tear it all down piece by piece."

"You already tried to kill me once," Camille reminded her with a calmness she didn't entirely feel.hat makes you think a second attempt will go any better?"

Rose's hand gripped the doorknob. "Because this time, I won't make the mistake of thinking your death is enough. This time, I want you alive to see it all burn."

With those words, she yanked open the door and disappeared into the hallway, leaving nothing bu the lingering scent of rain and the echo of her footsteps.	0

Camille sank into her chair, the confrontation replaying in her mind. She should call security, make sure Rose had actually left the building. She should call Victoria, warn her about Rose's unexpected visit and clear threats. She should do a dozen practical, sensible things.

Instead, she found herself staring at the empty space where Rose had stood, struck by the realizaion that despite all the pain and destruction between them, she felt nothing but emptiness when looking at her sister. No hate. No fear. Not even satisfaction at seeing Rose's downfall.

Just a hollow recognition that they were both products of the same broken system, Rose fighting to take what she believed she deserved, Camille fighting to protect what was hers. Two sides of the same tarnished coin.

Her phone buzzed again. Alexander: *No response? Did you fall asleep at your desk again?*

Camille looked at the message, thinking of connections formed through kindness rather than pain. Of futures built on creation rather than destruction. Of the person she was becoming rather than the one she'd been forced to be.

Rose's threat lingered in the air, ominous and heavy with promise. But for the first time since this began,Camille felt certain that whatever storm was coming, she wouldn't face it alone.

She typed back to Alexander: *Wide awake. And yes to dinner tomorrow. We have something important to discuss.*

Then she picked up her office phone and dialed Victoria's private line. As the phone rang, Camille gazed out at the rain-lashed city below, the lights blurring like scattered stars.

The battle with Rose wasn't over. Perhaps it never would be. But Camille no longer needed it tobe over to move forward.

She had rebuilt her life once from ashes, If necessary, she could do it again.

But this time, she wouldn't be fighting alone.
###Chapter 85

Rose stepped out of the black sedan, her eyes adjusting to the fading daylight as she gazed up at the gleaming skyscraper. The doorman nodded respectfully as she entered the marble lobby, her heels clicking against the polished floor,the last vestige of her former life's confidence.

The private elevator climbed sixty floors without stopping. She studied her reflection in the mirrored walls,barely recognizing the woman staring back. Her cheekbones jutted sharply beneath skin that had lost its glow. Dark circles shadowed her eyes. Only her expression remained unchanged, cold determination etched into every line.

"You made it," Herod Preston said as the elevator doors slid open directly into his penthouse. He stood framed against floor-to-ceiling windows,Manhattan sprawled behind him like a glittering carpet. "Welcome to your new home."

"Temporary arrangement," Rose corrected, stepping into the vast space. Her gaze swept across Italian furniture, original artwork, and views that stretched to the horizon. "Until I reclaim what's mine."

Herod's smile didn't reach his eyes."Of course." He moved to a bar cart of gleaming brass and crystal."Drink?"

"Bourbon.Neat."

He poured two glasses and handed one to Rose. "To new beginnings."

She ignored the toast, drinking deeply instead. The amber liquid burned down her throat, a welcome distraction from the constant ache of humiliation. "This isn't charity, is it? I need to understand exactly what you want."

"Direct. I appreciate that." Herod gestured toward a sitting area."Please."

Rose sank jinto a leather chair, keeping her spine rigid. She'd been living in a run-down motel for weeks, surviving on cash she'd hidden away. Pride had kept her from accepting help until desperation won out.Now she sat in luxury again, but as a beggar, not an owner.

"I've been watching Victoria Kane for a decade," Herod said, settling across from her. "Planning, waiting for the right moment to strike." His fingers tapped rhythmically against the glass. "Your situation creates an opportunity for us both."

"You mentioned your brother at our first meeting.Charles,was it?"

Herod's expression darkened. "Yes. Charles Preston. Engaged to Victoria's precious Sophia." He reached into his jacket and withdrew a silver frame, sliding it across the table. "That's them."

Rose studied the photograph of a handsome young man with Herod's features standing beside a smiling blonde woman. "So Victoria blamed your family for Sophia's accident."

"It wasn't an accident. Not entirely." Herod's voice dropped. "My father disapproved of the match.He pressured Charles to end it. When that failed, he arranged to have Sophia... frightened. The driver was instructed to run her off the road, just enough to scare her away from our family." His knuckles whitened around his glass. "Things went wrong. The car flipped. Sophia died instantly."

"And Victoria discovered this?"

"She knew. Couldn't prove it legally, but she knew." Herod's laugh held no humor. "Within six months,our shipping company faced regulatory investigations, contract cancellations, mysterious equipmentfailures.Our stock plummeted. My father's reputation was systematically destroyed. He jumped from this very building eighteen months later."

Rose felt a chill despite the room's warmth. "And Charles?"

"Found hanging in his apartment after Victoria leaked documents suggesting he'd orchestrated the accident himself." Herod finished his drink in one swallow. "Victoria Kane doesn't just take revenge, she obliterates everything you love while forcing you to watch."

Rose understood completely. She'd witnessed the same methodical destruction of her own life, her fashion empire dismantled, her reputation shredded, her social standing erased. All orchestrated by the sister she'd tried to eliminate. "So you want revenge," she said. "Just like me."

"Justice," Herod corrected, pouring himself another drink.三want justice for my family. And I've spent ten years building the resources to get it."

"What resources? I heard your family lost everything."

"We lost the Preston name and fortune. But I was already building my own holdings under different companies." His eyes gleamed with dark pride. "Victoria was so focused on destroying what my father built,she never noticed the new enterprises emerging around her. I control shipping routes in eight countries now,with shares in twenty major ports. All through shell corporations Victoria hasn't connected to me."

Rose leaned forward. "And you need me because...?"

"Because Victoria has never been more vulnerable than she is right now." Herod set his glass down with precision. "She's exposed herself by bringing Camille forward publicly. Created a weakness where none existed before."

"Camille is my target," Rose said sharply. "I need to be clear about that."

"Our goals align perfectly." Herod smiled. "Victoria loves Camille like the daughter she lost. Destroying Camille destroys Victoria. And destroying Victoria allows me to reclaim everything she took from my family."

"How exactly do we do that?" Rose asked. "Camille has Victoria's resources, Kane Industries' security.I can't even get close to her without..."

"You won't need to." Herod rose and crossed to a sleek desk, returning with a laptop. "Victoria and Camille are launching something called the Phoenix Grid. Clean energy infrastructure worth billions." He opened the computer, turning it to show Rose a series of documents. "I have people inside Kane Industries feeding me information. The project breaks ground next month."

Rose studied the screen, unimpressed."So?"

"So the technology doesn't work." Herod's voice dropped to a whisper."Not the way they think it does. My sources tell me there are fatal flaws in the design that their testing hasn't revealed. When deployed at scale,the system will fail catastrophically."
"And this helps us how?"

"Rose," Herod said with exaggerated patience, "Kane Industries is investing forty percent of their liquid assets in this project. Alexander Pierce is committing similar amounts. When it fails, stock prices will collapse. But more importantly, if we acquire certain information before the failure and position ourselves correctly..."

"We can profit from their downfall," Rose finished, understanding dawning.

"Precisely. And with the right evidence leaked to the right people, we can make it appear that Camille knew about the flaws all along. That she deliberately misled investors."

"Securities fraud," Rose murmured. "Prison time."

"And complete destruction of the Kane legacy." Herod closed the laptop. "Victoria would lose everything,her company, her reputation, and her precious new daughter."

Rose felt a smile spread across her face for the first time in weeks. "I want to be there when it happens.I want to see her face when she realizes she's lost everything, just like I did."

"That's the spirit." Herod reached for a decanter. "More bourbon?"

"Not yet." Rose stood and walked to the windows, gazing out at the city that had once been her playground."Tell me more about this Phoenix Grid. Who designed it?"

"Their chief engineer is someone named Hannah Zhao. Brilliant but inexperienced. The fatal flaws are in her integration systems."

Rose turned, a strange light in her eyes. "And who oversees the project for Kane Industries?"

"Camille herself. It's her pet project, her big debut as Victoria's heir."

"And Alexander Pierce? What's his involvement?"

"He's all in. Provided the original solar technology. His reputation in sustainable energy rides on this project's success."
Rose pressed her palms against the cool glass, feeling the vibration of the city below. "I know where to strike."

"Oh?" Herod raised an eyebrow.

"Camille thinks she's won. That I'm beaten." Rose's reflection smiled back at her, feral and hungry."But I know something Victoria Kane doesn't."

"And what's that?"

Rose turned from the window, her face transformed by purpose. "I know Camille's greatest weakness isn't Victoria or even Alexander Pierce. It's that she still thinks like Camille Lewis underneath it all. Still believes in things like justice and redemption." Her laugh was brittle. "And I know exactly how to use that against her."

Herod watched her with new interest. "I think this arrangement will benefit us both tremendously."

"It's not about benefit." Rose's voice hardened. "It's about survival. Camille took everything from me,my reputation, my business, Stefan. She turned my parents against me and made me a social pariah."

"And now?"

"Now I'll take everything from her." Rose picked up her abandoned bourbon and drained it."Not just her money or company. I'll take her soul."

Herod refilled her glass. "To detailed planning and perfect execution."

Rose raised her glass, but her mind was already racing ahead, calculating angles and vulnerabilities. For the first time since the Phoenix Gala, she felt alive again. Not just with anger, but with purpose.

"I'll need access to your sources inside Kane Industries," she said. "And I'll need to know everything about this Hannah Zhao."

"Consider it done." Herod pressed a button on a remote, and a hidden door slid open. "I've prepared a suite for you.Everything you need should be there, including new identification and credit cards."

Rose nodded, taking the hallway toward her new quarters. Behind her, she heard Herod call out.
"What exactly did you mean, Rose? About knowing where to strike?"

She paused in the doorway, not bothering to turn around. "Camille thinks she died in that parking garage and was reborn stronger. But she's wrong. She's still the same underneath, still believes in fixing things rather than destroying them."

"And?"

Rose glanced over her shoulder, her eyes gleaming in the half-light. "The Phoenix Grid isn't just a project to her. It's her redemption. Her proof that she can create instead of destroy." Her lips curved into a smile."And when we take that from her, when we turn her creation into destruction, we won't just ruin her financially."

"We'll break her completely," Herod finished, understanding darkening his features.

"Exactly." Rose stepped through the doorway. "We strike at the heart of who she's trying to become. AndI know exactly how to do it."

The door slid closed behind her, leaving Herod staring after her with newfound respect, and perhaps a touch of fear, for the woman who'd lost everything but her capacity for calculated cruelty.
###Chapter 86

Camille woke to her phone's insistent buzz. Seventeen missed calls. Forty-two texts. Hundreds of news alerts.

Her stomach tightened as she read the first notification: "BREAKING: Kane Heiress Mental Health Crisis Exposed."

The Daily Chronicle headline screamed across her screen: "CAMILLE LEWIS: THE DISTURBING TRUTH BEHIND THE REVENGE PLOT."

Below it, a photo of Rose looking vulnerable and tearful, alongside an image of Camille from the Phoenix Gala, her expression caught in a moment that appeared almost manic.

She scrolled down, each paragraph hitting her like a physical blow:

"Anonymous sources close to the Lewis family have revealed a decades-long history of mental health concerns regarding Camille Lewis. Medical records suggest diagnoses of paranoid delusions and persecution complex dating back to her teenage years."

"These conditions reportedly worsened after her marriage to Stefan Rodriguez, culminating in violent outbursts and fabricated accusations against her adopted sister,Rose Lewis."

"The dramatic 'resurrection' and accusations at the recent Kane Industries gala appear to be the culmination of a carefully constructed delusion, enabled by Victoria Kane."

Camille's phone rang. Victoria.

"Have you seen it?" Victoria's voice cut through without greeting.

"I'm looking at it now," Camille fought to keep her voice steady. "How is this possible? These are complete lies. They claim to have medical records..."
"Fabricated, obviously. They've planted stories in every major outlet. It's coordinated and professional."

Camille opened her laptop. The story was everywhere, news sites, social media, television. Each outlet added its own spin, but the core narrative remained: Camille Lewis had always been unstable. Rose was the true victim. Victoria Kane had exploited a mentally ill woman for corporate revenge.

"They've included photos from my childhood," Camille's voice cracked. "Photos only my parents would have had."

There she was at thirteen, looking sullen, the caption reading "Early signs of isolation and paranoia."

Another image showed her arguing with Rose.... "Violent confrontation before witnesses."

"This is Rose," Camille whispered. "It has to be."

"With help," Victoria added grimly. "This level of media saturation requires resources."

Camille read comments beneath the articles. The public had already chosen sides:

"Always thought something was off about that whole revenge story."

"Poor Rose! Imagine living with someone that unstable."

"Kane Industries stock dropping. Would YOU trust a mentally ill woman to run a billion-dollar company?"

Alexander texted: "I'm on my way over. Don't talk to anyone. We'll handle this."

Camille was too busy scrolling through a supposed "exclusive interview" with a former classmate who claimed she had exhibited "disturbing behavior" in college.

"None of this is true," she whispered. "I never even had therapy until after the parking garage attack."

"Truth is irrelevant in today's media environment," Victoria said. "This is about narrative control."

The doorbell rang. Camille jumped, still in her nightclothes.

"Ms. Kane?" Her housekeeper called. "There are reporters outside the gates."

"Tell them Ms. Kane has no comment," Victoria instructed through the phone. "And activate privacy protocol "What's protocol seven?" Camille asked.

"Lockdown procedures.Additional security, communications blackout except for secure lines. This is a calculated attack, Camille. Not just character assassination, they're trying to destabilize Kane Industries through you."

Camille's television switched on automatically, tuned to financial news: "....stock opening down twelve percent on reports questioning the mental fitness of Kane's heir apparent. Analysts suggest this could impact the upcoming Phoenix Grid project launch."

She muted it but couldn't look away from the scrolling ticker showing Kane Industries' stock falling inreal time.

"They're hitting us from every angle," Victoria observed. "Personal reputation, company valuation, project viability."

Camille's phone lit up with more notifications about her supposed mental instability.

"They're saying l've been institutionalized multiple times," she told Victoria, her voice hollow. "That I attacked Rose physically before disappearing."

"Don't engage with any of it. This is exactly what they want, to throw you off balance, make you react emotionally."

A financial alert popped up: "Analysts questioning stability of Phoenix Grid project leadership as Kane Industries heir faces mental health allegations."

"They're targeting the project. How would Rose even know about the technical details of Phoenix Grid?"

A heavy silence fell on Victoria's end.

"Victoria?"

"We have a leak," Victoria said finally. "Someone inside Kane Industries is feeding information to Rose."
The doorbell rang again.

"Ms. Kane! Mr. Pierce is here."

Camille took five minutes to dress, brush her hair, and apply minimal makeup. When she opened her bedroom door, Alexander stood in her living room, speaking urgently with Victoria on his phone.

"Our communications team is tracking the source," he said.sophisticated, multiple points of origin,carefully timed releases."

"It's Rose," Camille said flatly.

"Rose with considerable resources behind her," Alexander corrected. "The technical analysis alone...."

"Technical analysis?"

"There's a piece in the Journal questioning the Phoenix Grid technology. Highly technical, citing 'anonymous engineers' who claim the integration systems are fundamentally flawed."

"Turn on the television," Alexander said suddenly.

Camille unmuted to find Rose on screen, looking pale and composed.

"I've stayed silent too long," Rose was saying, her voice gentle with practiced sorrow. "I wanted to protect my sister, even after everything. Mental illness isn't something to be ashamed of, but when it leads to destructive behavior..."

"You maintained your silence even when Camille Lewis publicly accused you of attempting to have her killed," the interviewer noted.

Rose dabbed at her eyes. "What would you have me do? Publicly call my own sister delusional? Our family has tried for years to get her the help she needs. When she disappearedd, we were devastated. We thought she'd..." She trailed off.

"Taken her own life?" the interviewer supplied.

Rose nodded, her expression a masterpiece of concerned grief."Her doctors had warned us about self- harm tendencies."

"Turn it off," Camille whispered.

Alexander switched off the television."We need to respond immediately."

Victoria's voice emerged from the speakerphone."We need to be strategic. A full-frontal denial looks defensive."

"I want to confront her," Camille said, fists clenched.

"That's exactly what she wants," Victoria countered. "You, emotional and defensive, playing into the unstable narrative."

Camille's news feed refreshed: "Lewis Family to Break Silence, Parents of Troubled Heiress Will Address Daughter's 'Painful History' in Exclusive Interview Tomorrow."

The phone slipped from Camille's hand. Her parents. Would they actually participate in this charade?

"This is psychological warfare," Alexander said. "They're trying to isolate you."

"It's working," Camille whispered. Through the window, she could see the growing media presence.... vans with satellite dishes, reporters with microphones, all trained on her home like weapons.

"The board is calling an emergency meeting," Victoria announced. "Alexander, stay with Camille. Work on a statement."

After Victoria disconnected, silence filled the room.

"How?" Camille finally asked. "How did she do this? Make me the villain of my own story?"

Alexander stood beside her. "By exploiting the same human tendency that allowed her to manipulate you for years,people's willingness to believe the worst when it's presented as revealing hidden truth."

"And now everyone thinks I'm crazy. That I invented the whole thing."

"Not everyone," Alexander said quietly. "Not me. Not Victoria. Not anyone who knows the real you."
"But the Phoenix Grid.... they're attacking the project too."

"Because they know it matters to you. This isn't just Rose being vengeful. This is coordinated."

As he stepped away, Camille turned back to the window, watching the reporters. She had survived Rose's attempt to kill her once before. She had rebuilt herself, transformed her pain into power.

She could do it again.

But doubt had been planted. How many more attacks could she withstand? How many people would believe these lies? And if Rose succeeded in destroying the Phoenix Grid before it launched...

Outside, a reporter looked up directly at her window, pointing. Others followed, cameras lifting. Camille stepped back, but not before seeing several flashes.

Tomorrow's headlines already writing themselves in her mind: "Kane Heiress Watches From Shadows As Scandal Grows."

She closed her eyes, summoning the strength Victoria had helped her build.
###Chapter 87

Rose lifted her champagne flute, the bubbles catching the afternoon sunlight that streamed through the penthouse windows. Across the table, Herod mirrored her movement, his eyes glinting with satisfaction.On the television behind them, muted news channels cycled through images of Camille's face alongside headlines questioning her mental state. The stock ticker at the bottom showed Kane Industries down fifteen percent and falling.

"To bringing down giants," Herod said.

They clinked glasses. Rose savored the expensive champagne, allowing herself this moment of triumph.

" must admit," Herod said, settling back in his chair,our media contacts exceeded my expectations. The coverage is...spectacular."

Rose smiled, running her finger along the rim of her glass. "Money talks. But so do old favors." She nodded toward the television where her tearful interview was replaying. "Eliza Jenkins has hated Victoria Kane for a decade.Ever since Victoria blocked her husband's appointment to the Federal Reserve. Getting her to conduct my interview was almost too easy."

"And the medical records? A particularly inspired touch."

"There are no medical records," Rose laughed, the sound sharp with triumph. "Just enough specific details to sound convincing, provided by a therapist who never treated Camille but is happy to consult anonymously for the right price."

Herod raised an eyebrow."Creative."

"It's how the game is played." Rose stood and walked to the window, looking out over Manhattan with fresh eyes. For weeks, the city had felt like a prison, places she couldn't go, people who wouldn't speak to her.Now it felt like a chessboard where she was moving pieces again. "The trick isn't just creating a lie. It's creating one so big, so shocking that people want to believe it."

"Especially when it comes from the tearful sister." Herod joined her at the window, champagne in hand."Your performance was quite moving."

1 learned from the best actors in the business, the ultra-rich." Rose's voice hardened. "Watching my so-called family pretend to be perfect while judging me for every mistake."

On the coffee table, Herod's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, his smile widening.

"Kane Industries has called an emergency board meeting," he said, raising his glass again. "Your sister is in full crisis mode."

Rose closed her eyes briefly, picturing Camille's face as she woke to find herself branded unstable and dangerous. The thought sent warmth through her chest.

"They've pulled her from the Phoenix Grid launch event," Herod continued, reading from his phone."Claiming she's 'focusing on technical aspects rather than public-facing duties."

"They're hiding her," Rose said, satisfaction flooding her voice. "Exactly what I wanted. The mighty Camille Kane, driven back into the shadows."

Herod poured more champagne for them both. "Phase one accomplished. But remember, this is just the beginning."

"The beginning of the end for Camille." Rose took the refilled glass. "Tomorrow my parents give their interview. My poor, concerned parents, heartbroken over their daughter's mental decline."

"They agreed to participate?"

"They don't know they're participating yet," Rose said with a harsh laugh. "But they will. My father wvill do anything to protect the family name. Including disowning his 'unstable' daughter if he thinks it will limit the damage."

"Ruthless." Herod studied her with new appreciation. "You've thought of everything."

"Not everything." Rose's eyes darkened. "Victoria Kane is still standing. That woman has weathered worse "Which is why phase two targets the Phoenix Grid itself." Herod gestured toward his desk where blueprints and technical documents were spread out. "My sources inside their engineering department provide weekly updates. The more we learn, the more vulnerable points we find."

"Explain it again," Rose said, moving toward the desk. "How exactly do we sabotage a clean energy project without getting caught?"

Herod joined her, laying his hand on a schematic.don't have to sabotage anything physically. We just need to prove it was built on flawed assumnptions."

"And how do we do that?"

"By revealing that Hannah Zhao, their chief engineer, falsified her initial test results." Herod tapped a document. "The system works in controlled settings but fails under the load conditions of a full city grid.Zhao knew this six months ago but buried the findings to keep her job."

"And you have proof of this?"

"I will by next week." Herod's smile didn't reach his eyes."My contact is gathering the final pieces.When they release the evidence, Kane Industries will face more than bad publicity. They'll be looking at fraud charges, investor lawsuits, regulatory investigations."

"And Camille takes the fall," Rose whispered, the image so sweet she could almost taste it. "The unstable heiress who pushed forward a dangerous project despite warnings."

She moved to the television, turning up the volume just as a financial analyst appeared on screen.

"Investors are rightfully concerned," the woman was saying. "Kane Industries has positioned the Phoenix Grid as the cornerstone of their future growth strategy. If the leadership of that project is compromised,as these reports suggest, we have to question the viability of the technology itself."

"Listen to them," Rose said, gesturing at the screen. "They've already connected Camille's supposed instability to doubts about the project. We barely had to nudge them in that direction."
"People see what they expect to see," Herod agreed. "Create the right framework, and they fill in the blanks themselves."

Rose stared at the screen as it cut to footage of Victoria Kane entering Kane Industries headquarters,surrounded by security and ignoring shouted questions from reporters. The older woman's face was a stone mask, revealing nothing, but Rose could read the tension in her posture.

"I wish I could see inside that building right now," Rose murmured. "Victoria realizing her perfect revenge plan is unraveling. Camille hiding away as the world questions her sanity."

Herod's phone rang. He excused himself, moving toward his office while Rose remained transfixed by the images on television.

Now they showed Camille's house, journalists crowded at the gates while security kept them back. The caption read: "Kane Heiress Remains Secluded as Mental Health Questions Mount."

Rose felt a rush unlike anything she'd experienced before, not just satisfaction or triumph, but something deeper and more primal.

Herod returned, his face alight with fresh news. "Alexander Pierce has been making calls to his investigative team. They're trying to trace the source of the leaks."

"Let them try," Rose said, unconcerned. "We've covered our tracks."

"We have, but vigilance is essential." Herod checked his watch. "The interview with your parents is scheduled for 9 AM tomorrow. Have you made the necessary arrangements?"

Rose nodded, her expression turning calculating. "My father received documents this morning detailing 'concerns' about Camille's mental state going back years. Along with a reminder about what happened to the last family who publicly contradicted these reports."

"A threat?"

"A warning." Rose smiled thinly.father understands self-preservation. He'll say exactly what the interviewer expects to hear."
"And if he doesn't?"

"Then we release evidence of his offshore accounts." Rose shrugged. "He doesn't know we know about those. But we do, thanks to your financial investigators."

Herod whistled softly. "You really would destroy your own father."

"He stopped being my father the moment he chose Camille at the Phoenix gala." Rose's voice turned to ice."Family is just another word for people who haven't betrayed you yet."

A notification chimed on Herod's laptop. He moved to check it, his expression shifting from curiosity to delight.

"Kane Industries stock has triggered circuit breakers. Trading temporarily halted after falling twenty percent." Herod looked up at her. "The market is passing judgment faster than we anticipated."

Rose closed her eyes, letting the news wash over her. Twenty percent. Billions of dollars in value erased in a single day. Because of her.

"Victoria must be beside herself," she said, reopening her eyes."The great business titan, watching her empire crumble."

"This is only the beginning of her pain," Herod reminded her."When we reveal the Phoenix Grid flaws next week, the real damage begins."

Rose moved to the bar cart, pouring herself a measure of whiskey. The burn of alcohol down her throat matched the fire of vengeance in her chest.

"I want to be there," she said suddenly. "When they realize the Phoenix Grid is flawed. I want to see Camille's face."

Herod considered her request. "Risky. You're too recognizable now."

"I'll find a way." Rose wasn't asking permission. "I've spent too long watching from the sidelines."①

An assistant entered with news about tomorrow's interview arrangements. After finalizing details, Rose turned back to Herod. "We should celebrate properly tonight. Dinner at Eleven Madison Park? I'm suddenly in the mood to be seen."

"Bold,"Herod commented. "Flaunting yourself while Camille hides away."

"That's the point." Rose drained her whiskey. "I'm not the one in disgrace anymore. I'm the victim,remember? The concerned sister who finally found the courage to speak her truth."

As the afternoon sun began to fade, casting long shadows across the city, Rose returned to the window.Somewhere out there, Camille was hiding, wounded and cornered.

The thought should have been enough. But Rose realized with mild surprise that it wasn't.

"What are you thinking about?" Herod asked, noticing her silence.

Rose kept her eyes on the city below. "I'm thinking that when this is over, when we've taken everything from her...I want her to live."

"Live?" Herod sounded surprised. "I would have thought you wanted her destroyed completely."

"Death is too quick." Rose turned, her expression chilling in its calmness. "I want her to livea long,empty life knowing she had everything and lost it. Just like I did."

Herod studied her for a long moment. "You're more dangerous than I initially assessed, Ms. Lewis."

"Thank you." Rose accepted it as the compliment it was meant to be.

As they prepared to leave, Rose paused by the television once more. The screen showed Alexander Pierce entering Camille's home, his face grim and determined.

"The white knight rushes to save the damsel," she murmured.
0

"Does that concern you?" Herod asked, retrieving his jacket.

Rose shook her head, a slow smile spreading across her face. "No. It's perfect actually. When Camille falls,Alexander falls with her. Two enemies destroyed for the price of one."

She switched off the television, casting the room into sudden silence. The news would still be there tomorrow,with fresh headlines, new revelations, more damage to inflict.

"Ready?" Herod asked, holding open the door.

Rose stepped into the hallway, head high, eyes bright with triumph. "I've been ready for this my entire life."

Behind them, the penthouse fell quiet, the schematics for the Phoenix Grid laid out on Herod's desk like a blueprint not just for a clean energy project, but for the complete devastation of Camille Kane and everything she had built.

The first battle was won. The war continued tomorrow.
###Chapter 88

The executive boardroom of Kane Industries fell silent as Victoria Kane entered, Camnille following close behind. Ten pairs of eyes tracked their movement, calculating and wary. The morning sunlight streaming through the windows did nothing to warm the atmosphere.

Victoria took her place at the head of the table. Camile sat to her right, feeling the weight of scrutiny press down on her shoulders. She had dressed with particular care that morning-a structured navy suit,minimal jewelry, hair pulled back severely. The outfit of a serious businesswoman, not an unstable heiress.

James Whitley, the longest-serving board member, cleared his throat. "Thank you for meeting on such short notice. Given the extraordinary circumstances, we felt immediate discussion was necessary."

Victoria's face remained impassive. "The circumstances being?"

"Don't play games, Victoria," snapped Eleanor Price from across the table. The former federal judge had always maintained professional distance. Today, that distance had turned to frost. "Our stock dropped twenty-two percent before trading was halted. The market reopens in three hours. We need answers now."

"The allegations against Camille are false," Victoria said, her voice measured but firm.coordinated attack designed to damage Kane Industries through character assassination."

"That may be," said Michael Chen, the soft-spoken CFO. "But market perception is our current reality.Investors are fleeing. Partners are calling with concerns. Three major clients have already requested meetings to discuss 'continuity of leadership."

"The Phoenix Grid launch is two weeks away," added Diane Rodriguez. "We've invested billions. If confidence in the technology collapses along with confidence in..." She hesitated, eyes sliding to Camille."In leadership, we face an existential threat."

Camille kept her expression neutral. She had prepared for this, rehearsed with Victoria until dawn. Show strength. Show control. Any display of emotion would only reinforce the narrative they were fighting against.

"The Phoenix Grid technology is sound," Camille said, speaking for the first time. "The engineering team has verified every aspect. We have redundant testing protocols precisely to prevent any single point of failure."

Whitley's eyes narrowed. "That's not the concern, Ms. Kane. The concern is whether your... personal situation has compromised your judgment regarding the project."

"My personal situation?" Camille felt her control slip slightly. "You mean the lies being spread about me?"

"Regarding those allegations," said Eleanor, shuffling papers. "These supposed medical records..."

"Are fabricated," Victoria cut in."Obviously."

"Are they? Because their specificity is concerning." Eleanor read from a document. "Treatment for paranoid delusions at age sixteen. Hospitalization following a violent episode during college. Ongoing therapy for persecution complex. These are detailed claims."

"False claims," Victoria said, her knuckles whitening around her pen.

"Then why haven't you sued for defamation?" This from Thomas Gordon, the newest board member."The company's standard response to false reporting has always been immediate legal action."

Victoria's eyes flashed. "We are gathering evidence on the source of these fabrications before filing.Strategic patience is not inaction."

"What about the interview with Rose Lewis?" Diane pressed. "She made specific claims about witnessing unstable behavior. And now the parents are scheduled to speak tomorrow."
0
Camille felt the blood drain from her face. She hadn't known about her parents' interview until this moment.

"Rose Lewis is a proven liar," Victoria said flatly. "The woman orchestrated an attempt on Camille's life. Her credibility is non-existent,"

"The public doesn't seem to agree," said Michael, sliding a tablet toward the center. "Social media sentiment analysis shows 68% of public response favors Rose's version of events."
"We're not running this company based on Twitter polls," Victoria said, her tone sharp.

"No, we run it based on market value and shareholder confidence," Eleanor countered. "Both of which are in freefall."

A heavy silence descended. Camille heard the soft hum of the air conditioning, the muted sounds of the city below.

"What exactly are you suggesting?" Victoria finally asked, though her tightness around her eyes suggested she already knew.

James Whitley exchanged glances with the other board members. "The board believes it would be in the company's best interest if Camile stepped back from her role until this situation resolves."

"Steps back?" Victoria's voice remained calm, but Camille saw the tiny muscle jump in her jaw.

"Temporarily removes herself from all public-facing duties," Whitley clarified. "No Phoenix Grid launch appearance. No investor meetings. No press. A leave of absence, effective immediately."

"And if we refuse this suggestion?" Victoria asked.

"It's not a suggestion," Eleanor said coldly. "It's a decision. The vote was seven to three."

Victoria stood slowly. "You held a vote without the CEO?"

"Emergency provision, section 7B of the corporate charter," Thomas Gordon stated. "When leadership decisions may impact company valuation by more than fifteen percent, the board may convene without full executive presence."

"May I remind this board that I hold controlling interest in Kane Industries?"

"You hold sixty percent," Gordon corrected. "Significant, but not controlling."

"I've led this company through three recessions, two hostile takeover attempts, and countless market fluctuations," Victoria said, each word precise. "I've increased shareholder value by over six hundred percent during my tenure. And you presume to make decisions about my chosen successor without me?"
"This isn't personal, Victoria," Whitley attempted. "It's business. The market has spoken."

"It is entirely personal," Victoria interrupted. "This entire situation stems from a personal vendetta against Camille, and by extension, against me."

"Regardless of origin," Eleanor said, "the damage is real. We must contain it."

Camille felt the weight of their judgment. She had prepared to fight external enemies-Rose, the media,public opinion. She hadn't expected exile from within.

"I understand the board's concern, she said, surprising herself with her steady voice. "Kane Industries'success matters more than any individual. Even me."

Victoria's head snapped toward her, a flash of something crossing her face.

"If stepping back temporarily helps stabilize market confidence," Camille continued, "I'm willing todo so.On one condition."

"You're not in a position to make conditions,"Gordon said dismissively.

Camille fixedhim with a stare that made him flinch."Mycondition is that I remain fully/involved with Phoenix Grid development, even if not publicly. The project needs my oversight to succeed."

Whitley nodded slowly. "That seems reasonable."

"James," Victoria began, a warning in her voice.

"It's a sensible compromise, Victoria," he said quietly.

Camille turned to Victoria, silently pleading with her to understand. This wasn't surrender. It was tactical retreat.

Finally, Victoria faced the board again. "Very well. Camille will step back from public duties temporarily. All Phoenix Grid operational decisions still run through her. And the company releases a statement today expressing full confidence in her leadership and denouncing these false allegations."

Eleanor frowned. "The statement should focus on Kane Industries' stability, not personal-" "Those are my terms," Victoria cut her off. "Take them or I call for a confidence vote on every person at this table."

The threat hung in the air.

"Fine," Whitley conceded after a tense silence. "PR will draft something for your approval."

Victoria stood. "This meeting is adjourned. Camille and I have a company to run. Despite your best efforts to hamstring us."

As the board members filed out, only James Whitley paused at the door.ctoria, this isn't personal. We're trying to protect what you've built."

"Get out," Victoria replied, her voice like ice.

When the door closed, Victoria sank back into her chair, suddenly looking older than Camille had ever seen her.

"I should have prepared you better,"Victoria said. "For what it feels like when the knives come from inside the house."

"You couldn't have," Camille replied."Some lessons you can only learn by bleeding."

Victoria's eyes softened. "You handled that well. Better than I did."

"I gave in. You didn't."

"No," Victoria shook her head. "You adapted. There's a difference." She stared out at the New York skyline."I've watched directors come and go for thirty years. Weathered their challenges, their doubts. But this..This feels different."	ǜ

"Because it is different. This isn't just business maneuvering. This is Rose. And whoever's helping her."

"Herod Preston," Victoria practically spat the name. "Using Rose to strike at us both."

"Then we strike back," Camille said, resolve strengthening.

Victoria studied her face. "They'll be watching for exactly that. Any sign of 'erratic behavior' will only reinforce their narrative."

"Then we do what Kane women do best," Camille said. "We fight smarter, not harder."

The hint of a smile touched Victoria's lips. "You are truly my daughter now."

A knock at the door interrupted them. Victoria's assistant entered.

"Ms. Kane, the PR team is waiting. And... Mr. Pierce called again. He says it's urgent."

"Tell Alexander I'll call him when I'm finished with PR," Victoria replied.

"Actually," the assistant clarified, "he was asking for Camille."

Victoria and Camille exchanged glances. Alexander had been mysteriously absent since yesterday's crisis began.

"Take the call in my office," Victoria said. "I'll handle PR. We need to get ahead of the board's decision before it leaks."

As they prepared to leave, Victoria paused, her hand on Camille's arm. "Remember what I taught you. When enemies surround you..."

"Trust no one completely," Camille finished. "Not even allies."

"You mean Alexander."

"I mean everyone," Victoria replied. "Including me."

With that warning, Victoria swept from the room, shoulders back, head high. As board members scurried from her path, Camille noticed something, the slight tremor in Victoria's hands, quickly hidden by clenched fists.

The unshakable Victoria Kane was shaken. And that, more than anything else, sent a chill down Camille's spine.

She made her way to Victoria's office, closing the door firmly behind her. Whatever Alexander wanted,whatever new crisis loomed, she would face it with the same strength she'd shown in the boardroom.
But as she reached for the phone, she couldn't silence the whisper of doubt. If the board could turn on Victoria so quickly, if public opinion could shift against Camille overnight, what other betrayals might be waiting?

Who else might be wielding knives in the dark?
###Chapter 89

Alexander Pierce's car slid to a stop outside the modest apartment building in Brooklyn. He checked the address on his phone again, confirming this was indeed where Stefan Rodriguez now lived. The fall from grace had been steep, from a penthouse overlooking Central Park to this brick walkup with peeling paint.

"Wait here," he told his driver, stepping out into the brisk afternoon air.

The security buzzer was broken. Alexander pushed through the lobby door, grimacing at the smell of old cooking oil and cigarettes that hung in the narrow hallway. Apartment 3B was at the end of the third-floor corridor, its door as shabby as the rest of the building.

Alexander straightened his tie, a habit from childhood when facing difficult situations, and knocked.

Footsteps approached from inside, followed by the click of locks. The door swung open to reveal Stefan Rodriguez, unshaven and bleary-eyed in wrinkled clothes. Recognition dawned slowly on his face, followed by confusion.

"Pierce? What the hell are you doing here?"

Alexander kept his face neutral. "We need to talk."

Stefan laughed, the sound hollow and bitter. "About what? How your girlfriend destroyed my family's company? Or maybe you want the recipe for rock bottom. I've perfected it lately."

"About Camille," Alexander said simply. "She needs your help."

Something flickered across Stefan's face, surprise, guilt, curiosity. He stepped back, gesturing Alexander inside with a mocking bow.

"Welcome to my humble new reality. Excuse the mess. Maid service was one of the first luxuries to go."

The apartment was small but surprisingly clean, despite Stefan's appearance. A laptop sat open on a folding table surrounded by job applications and financial documents. Empty takeout containers clustered near an overflowing trash can. A mattress on the floor served as both bed and couch.

"Drink?" Stefan asked, retrieving a half-empty whiskey bottle from the kitchenette.not the thirty-year-old Macallan you're probably used to, but it does the job."

"No, thank you." Alexander remained standing, studying the man before him.

"Suit yourself." Stefan poured a generous measure into a water glass. "So what could the mighty Alexander Pierce possibly want from me? Last time I checked, I was fresh out of shipping companies for you to acquire."

Alexander cut through the bitterness. "Have you seen the news about Camille?"

Stefan's expression changed, defenses dropping momentarily. "About her supposed mental issues? Yeah.Hard to miss when your ex-wife is being torn apart on every channel."

"It's all lies," Alexander said flatly. "Fabricated by Rose and someone with significant resources."

"And this concerns me how, exactly?" Stefan took a long drink, but his eyes betrayed interest despite his detached tone.

Alexander stepped closer. "Because you're the only person who can convincingly refute Rose's story."

Stefan snorted. "Me? The ex-husband who cheated on her with her sister? That's your character witness?"

"Yes," Alexander said firmly. "You lived with Camille for years. You know she never had these supposed psychiatric problems. You know Rose is lying."

Stefan set down his glass, studying Alexander with new focus."Why would I help her? Camille made her feelings for me perfectly clear. She wants nothing to do with me."

"This isn't about what Camille wants from you,"Alexander replied.s about doing the right thing.For once."

The words hung in the air between them. Stefan turned away, moving to the apartment's single window. He stared out at the brick wall of the neighboring building.
"You know what's strange?" he said finally. "Watching someone you hurt succeed without you.Seeing them build something new from the ruins you left them in." He glanced back at Alexander. "Camille with Kane Industries.The Phoenix Grid.Her new life with you."

"This isn't about me," Alexander started.

"Isn't it?" Stefan turned fully now, something sharp in his gaze. "The great Alexander Pierce, rushing to save Camille. Tell me, are you doing this because it's 'right' or because you're in love with her?"

Alexander felt heat rise in his neck, caught off guard by the direct question."My personal feelings aren't relevant to..."

"They're completely relevant," Stefan interrupted. "Because if this is just business, protecting Kane Industries and your investment in the Phoenix Grid, then I've got nothing for you. But if you actually care about her..."

Alexander's carefuly maintained composure cracked. "Of course I care about her. I've watched her rebuild herself from nothing. Seen her fight through pain that would destroy most people."

"That's not what I asked." Stefan's eyes never left Alexander's face. "Are you in love with her?"

The question stripped away pretense. Alexander thought of Camille's face the first time she'd truly smiled at him, not as Camille Kane but as herself. How something had shifted inside him, recognizing the strength beneath her carefully constructed facade.

"Yes," he admitted, the word escaping before he could stop it.in love with her."

Stefan nodded slowly, as if confirming something he'd already known. "At leastyou're honest about it.That's more than l ever was."

He moved to the kitchenette, refilling his glass. "You know, when I first saw Camille Kane at that gallery opening, something felt familiar. I couldn't place it. Her face was different, but something in her eyes..." He shook his head. "I should have recognized her."

"Would it have changed anything if you had?" Alexander asked.
Stefan considered this. "Probably not. I was too far gone by then. Too caught up in Rose's web." He took another drink. "Rose. God, what a fool l was."

"You're not the first man to be manipulated by her," Alexander said, though his tone carried little sympathy.

"No, but I'm the one who threw away someone good for her." Stefan's voice roughened. "You want to know if Camille ever showed signs of mental instability? The answer is no. Not once. She was the sanest, most grounded person I knew. Patient. Kind. Too kind, looking back."

"Then say that publicly," Alexander pressed. "Hold a press conference. Refute Rose's claims. Tell the world what Camille was really like."

Stefan laughed bitterly. "And who would believe me? The cheating ex-husband? I'm hardly a credible source."

"You're the only one who lived with her daily for years," Alexander countered. "Your testimony carries weight precisely because you have no reason to defend her. Everyone knows she hates you."

Stefan winced at the blunt assessment. "Thanks for that reminder."

"I'm not here to spare your feelings," Alexander said."I'm here because Camille is being destroyed by lies,and you're one of the few people who can help stopit."

Silence fell between them. Stefan drained his glass, setting it down with a decisive click.

"What exactly would I need to do?" he asked finally.

Alexander felt a surge of cautious hope. "Hold a press conference. Tomorrow, before the morning shows air that interview with the Lewis parents. Publicly refute every claim Rose has made about Camille's mental state. Confirm that Rose was always the manipulative one."

"And admit my role in all this,"Stefan added. "Admit I betrayed a perfectly sane, loving wife for a lie."

"γes."

Stefan moved back to the window, his silhouette dark against the gray afternoon light. "You know what the hardest part of losing everything is? It's not the money or the status. It's losing the lies you tell yourself.The stories that let you sleep at night."

He turned back to Alexander. "I told myseIf Camille and I were already broken before Rose, That | fell in love with Rose naturally, not because she orchestrated it. That Camille would be fine without me." His laugh was hollow. "All lies."

Alexander waited, sensing Stefan needed to process this moment in his own way.

"And now," Stefan continued, "now that I've lost it all anyway, those lies don't protect me anymore.I see everything clearly. Too clearly." He looked directly at Alexander. "I see what I threw away. What you found."

The two men studied each other, former rivals now linked by their connection to the same woman.

"If I do this," Stefan said slowly, "I'm not doing it for you. Or even for Camille, really. She doesn't need my help to be extraordinary."

"Why, then?" Alexander asked.

"Because it's true," Stefan said simply. "And I've told enough lies in my life." He straightened his shoulders."I'll hold your press conference. Tell the world exactly who Rose Lewis is, and who Camille really was."

Alexander nodded, relief washing through him."Thank you."

"Don't thank me," Stefan warned. "I'm not doing this to help you win her."

"That's not why I'm here."

"Isn't it?" Stefan's eyes were knowing."You love her. You want to protect her. I understand that drive better than you think."

Alexander changed tactics. "If you're goingto do this, it needs to be tomorrow morning. Early. Before the Lewis parents' interview airs."

"It will be." Stefan's voice strengthened with resove. "I'll contact my uncle's former PR team tonight. Nine AM press conference. Major networks."

"I can handle the arrangements," Alexander offered.
"No." Stefan's refusal was firm. "If I'm doing this, I'm doing it my way. Not as Alexander Pierce's puppet."

Alexander conceded with a nod. "Fair enough. But the timing is crucial."

"I understand." Stefan moved to his laptop, already typing. "Nine AM. The Rodriguez name still carries enough weight to get media attention, even if our ships don't sail anymore."

Alexander took out a business card and placed it on the table./private number. Call when it's arranged."

As he turned to leave, Stefan's voice stopped him at the door.

"Pierce.One more thing."

Alexander looked back questioningly.

"Do you ever wonder," Stefan asked, "if Camille is using you the way Victoria used her? If beneath all that love you feel, you're just another chess piece in their revenge game?"

The question cut closer to Alexander's private doubts than he cared to admit. "Camille isn't Victoria."

"No," Stefan agreed. "But she learned from the master. Just... be careful. That's all."

Alexander left without responding, the warning echoing in his mind as he descended the shabby stairwell.

Outside, the cool air cleared his head. He had accomplished his mission, Stefan would speak for Camille. Yet he felt unsettled, not just by Stefan's parting words but by his own confession.

Yes, I'm in love with her.

He hadn't said those words aloud before, not even to himself. Now they hung in the air, spoken first to her ex-husband of all people. The irony wasn't lost on him.0

His phone rang as he slid into the backseat of his waiting car. Camille's name flashed on the screen.

"Where have you been?" she asked without preamble. "Victoria said you called it urgent."

Alexander glanced back at Stefan's apartment building, wondering how to explain what he'd just set in motion.
"l've béen working on a counterattack," he said carefully."One that might turn the tide in our favor."

"What kind of counterattack?" Suspicion colored her voice.

Alexander made a split-second decision. If Stefan backed out, telling Camille now would only give her false hope.

"' explain everything tonight," he promised."For now, just know that by this time tomorrow, Rose's story wil be unraveling."

There was a pause on the line."AlexanderCamille said finally, her voice softening. "Thank you. For fighting for me."

The simple gratitude caught him off guard, warming something in his chest. "Always," he replied,the word carrying more weight than she knew.

As he ended the call, his driver glanced in the rearview mirror."Where to,sir?"

Alexander looked out at the Brooklyn streets, seeing not the present but the future,tomorrow's headlines,Rose's reactions, Victoria's calculations. And Camille, caught in the center of it all.

"Back to Manhattan," he said firmly. "We have a war to win."

Behind him, Stefan Rodriguez stood at his third-floor window, watching Alexander's car pull away. His expression was unreadable as he picked up his phone and dialed a number he hadn't used in weeks.

"Karen? It's Stefan Rodriguez. I need to arrange a press conference for tomorrow morning. Nine AM sharp."He paused, listening. "Yes, it's about Camille Lewis, And no, this isn't a joke. It's about time someone told the truth."
###Chapter 90

Camille sat frozen in Victoria's private office, eyes fixed on the television. Alexander paced behind her chair while Victoria stood near the wvindow. The screen showed the Plaza Hotel ballroom converted into a press area,camera flashes pulsing across the room.

"Are you sure you want to watch this?" Alexander asked, touching Camille's shoulder.

Camille nodded, unable to speak, her throat tight and hands cold.

"They might still side with Rose," Victoria warned. "Be prepared."

The camera shifted to show Margaret and Richard Lewis entering. Camille sucked in a breath. Her parents looked older than she remembered, her father's shoulders stooped, her mother's face drawn. Behind them,unexpectedly,came Stefan Rodriguez.

"What is he doing there?" Camille whispered.

"Alexander's handiwork, I suspect," Victoria replied.

Richard adjusted the microphone, his hand trembling slightly. "Thank you all for coming. My wife and I have called this press conference to address the disturbing allegations made against our daughter, Camille."

Margaret stepped closer. "Two days ago, , false stories began circulating about Camille's mental health.Fabricated medical records. Invented episodes. Lies designed to destroy not just her reputation,but her very identity."

Camille gripped her chair as her mother continued with unusual fierceness.

"These lies did not come from strangers. They came from someone we once trusted. Someone we welcomed into our family and loved as our own." Her voice broke. "Our adopted daughter, Rose."

Murmurs rippled through the press. Richard placed a hand on Margaret's shoulder before speaking.
"For too long, we were blind to Rose's manipulation. We failed to see how she systematically undermined Camille, turned us against her, and eventually stole her husband." He glanced at Stefan. "We failed as parents to protect our daughter."

Margaret dabbed her eyes but continued. "Camille never had mental health issues. There were no hospitalizations, no treatments. The medical records being quoted don't exist."

A reporter called out, "Then why would Rose make these claims?"

Richard's face hardened. "Because Camille exposed Rose's lies at the Kane Foundation gala. Because Camille survived Rose's attempt to have her killed."

The room erupted with questions. Victoria increased the volume to hear over the clamor.

"Mrs. Lewis! Yesterday you were scheduled to appear on National Morning to confirm Rose's claims. What changed?"

Margaret's face showed raw pain."Last night, I found Rose altering Camille's childhood journals, adding false entries about paranoia and violence. When confronted, Rose threatened us."

She pulled a small leather-bound book from her purse. "This is Camille's actual journal from when Rose first came to live with us."

Camille felt her heart stop as Margaret opened to a marked page.

"'August 17. Rose 'accidentally' spilled bleach on my science project today. Mom blamed me for leaving it where it could be damaged. This is the third time something important to me has been destroyed since Rose arrived, but no one believes me when I say it's not an accident.'"

Margaret looked up, tears flowing. "There are dozens of entries like this. Small cruelties. Calculated sabotage.And we didn't listen."

In Victoria's office, Camille wiped her own tears, overwhelmed by this public acknowledgment of her suffering.

Richard gestured toward Stefan, who stepped forward reluctantly.
"My name is Stefan Rodriguez. I was married to Camille Lewis for three years before betraying her with her sister."

The blunt admission caused another stir.

"During our marriage, Camille never displayed any signs of mental instability. She was kind,patient,balanced, everything Rose is claiming she wasn't."

He squared his shoulders. "Rose pursued me relentlessly. She told me Camille didn't love me. Classic manipulation that I was too weak to recognize."

"Are you saying Rose lied about Camille's mental health?" a reporter shouted.

"Rose lied about everything," Stefan said flatly. "The woman I thought I loved never existed."

He paused. "What most people don't know is that Rose and I had a relationship years before I met Camille.Rose orchestrated our breakup, then manipulated me into dating and eventually marrying Camille, all part of her plan."

"It was Rose who introduced me to CamilStefan continued. "When Camille disappeared,Rose showed no real grief. Within weeks, she was planning our future together."

In the office, Alexander squeezed Camille's shoulder. "He's actually doing it. He's telling everything."

On screen, Stefan's face darkened. "Two nights before the articles of Camille mental instability came out i got a call from Rose and she said, 'After tomorrow, everyone will see whoCamille really is.' Now I realize she was already planning this smear campaign."

Margaret stepped forward again. "We have evidence that Rose orchestrated this media attack. Records of payments to journalists.Communications with media outlets."

She held up a flash drive. "We've gathered emails and financial records showing Rose's direct involvement in fabricating these stories. Copies have been provided to law enforcement and journalists."

Richard joined his wife. "Our daughter Camille is not mentally ill. She never was. The only person in our family with dangerous tendencies was Rose."
"Mr, and Mrs. Lewis! How do you respond to claims that this is just damage control for Kane Industries?"

Richard's expression hardened. "Our daughter nearly died because of Rose's actions. This isn't about business.It's about justice."

Stefan moved to the microphone again. "I've lost everything because of my mistakes. I'm not asking for sympathy. I'm here because it's time someone told the truth about Rose Lewis. She's dangerous and without conscience."

He took a deep breath. "If you're looking for someone with a personality disorder in the Lewis family,you've been focusing on the wrong sister."

The room erupted again as reporters shouted questions.

Margaret raised her hand for quiet. "We have one final statement. To our daughter, Camille." She looked directly into the camera. "We failed you. We chose Rose over you. We didn't believe you when you needed us most. There aren't enough words to express our regret."

Richard joined her. "We love you, Camille. We understand i you can never forgive us, but know that we are proud of the woman you've become, with or without our help."

In Victoria's office, Camille covered her mouth to stifle a sob.

Victoria silently offered a handkerchief, her expression uncharacteristically soft.

"Turn it off," Camille said suddenly.

Victoria muted the television but left the images running. "This changes everything. The narrative is shifting already,"

Camille stared at the silent footage. "Why? After everything, why would they do this?"

"For the same reason most people do anything," Victoria replied. "Because they realized what they stood to lose."

Camille shook her head. "No. They've already lost me."
"Perhaps. Or perhaps they finally understand that some things matter more than pride."

Camille's phone began buzzing incessantly. Victoria switched channels to the business network where an anchor was reporting: "...extraordinary reversal as Kane Industries stock surges following the Lewis family press conference..."

The office door flew open as Victoria's assistant rushed in. "The Phoenix Grid partners are calling to reaffirm their commitment! And the board members who voted against Camille are requesting an emergency meeting!"

Victoria smiled. "Tell them P'Il consider their request after our stock fully recovers."

The assistant nodded and retreated. Victoria turned to Camille, whose attention remained fixed on her parents leaving the podium.

"What are you thinking?" Victoria asked softly.

"I don't know what to feel," Camille admitted. "Grateful? Angry? It doesn't erase what they did."

"No," Victoria agreed. "But it does complicate your neat categories of ally and enemy."

Alexander checked his phone. "The market's already responding positively."

"How did my parents get all that evidence against Rose?" Camille asked.

"I may have had my team compile some files," Alexander admitted. "Your father was surprisingly receptive."

Camille's phone rang, her mother's number flashing on the screen. She stared at it, frozen.

"You don't have to answer," Victoria said.

"If I do, everything changes again."

"Yes."

"We stick to the plan. Rose and Herod destroyed. Clean.Final."

Victoria repeated. "But plans can evolve."
The ringing stopped. The call went to voicemail.

Camille opened her eyes. "They stood up for me."

"They did."

"After everything Rose did, they finally chose me."

Victoria nodded. "The question is: does it matter?"

Camille looked at the television where analysts were predicting Kane Industries' full recovery. Her parents'actions had saved more than her reputation, they'd protected everything she and Victoria had built.

"I don't know yet," she answered honestly.

Her phone chimed with a voicemail notification. Victoria rose from her desk.＂門give you privacy. There are decisions only you can make."

As Victoria left, Camille sat alone with her phone. Outside, she could hear the office buzzing with activity.Kane Industries would survive. The Phoenix Grid would proceed.

Rose's plan had failed.

But the greater question remained as Camille stared at her mother's name on the screen. After years of pain,after rebuilding herself, after finding a new mother in Victoria, could she open the door to her past?

Her finger hovered over the voicemail icon.

On the television, Rose's face appeared briefly, shocked and furious as reporters surrounded her, shouting questions about the accusations.

The sight strengthened something in Camille. She pressed the voicemail button and raised the phone to her ear.

"Camille," Margaret began, her voice breaking. "We've said what needed saying publicly. But there'sso much more I need to tell you privately. If you're willing to listen."

The message ended with a soft, "We love you. We always have. Even when we failed to show it."


Camille lowered the phone, her chest tight with emotion she couldn't name. Not forgiveness, not yet. But perhaps something like possibility.

Outside Victoria's office, the world was reshaping itself. Rose exposed. Camille vindicated. Kane Industries recovering.

But inside, in the quiet space between heartbeats, Camille faced the most difficult question: Who did she want to be when the dust settled? The woman who got her revenge, or the woman who built something new from the ashes?

She looked at her phone, then at Rose surrounded by reporters, and finally at her own reflection in Victoria's darkened screen.

Three versions of herself, three possible futures.

The choice was hers alone,
###Chapter 91

The crystal vase shattered against the wall, water and roses exploding across the cream-colored paint.Rose grabbed the next item within reach, a heavy silver photo frame and hurled it at the television where her parents' faces still filled the screen.

"Liars!" she screamed, her voice raw. "Filthy, worthless liars!"⑨

The frame cracked the television screen, splitting her father's image in two before the picture went black.

Rose stood in the middle of Herod's penthouse living room, chest heaving, hair wild around her face. The elegant space lay in ruins around her, furniture overturned, glass broken, papers scattered across the floor.Her hands trembled with rage as she searched for something else to destroy.

"Fourteen years!" She kicked over a side table, sending a lamp crashing to the floor. "Fourteen years playing the perfect daughter! The supportive sister! And they throw it away for her?"

She grabbed a leather-bound book and tore it in half, pages fluttering around her like wounded birds.

"After everything I did to make them love me! After everything I endured in that house, pretending to be grateful,pretending to belong!"

Her voice broke on the last word, anger momentarily giving way to something darker and more painful. She pressed her hands against her eyes, wvilling away the burning tears.

Behind her, the elevator doors opened silently. Herod Preston stepped into the chaos, surveying the destruction with raised eyebrows.

"I take it you've seen the press conference," he said dryly.

Rose whirled toward him, eyes blazing. "Did you know? Did you know they would do this?"

"If I had known your parents would suddenly develop backbones, I would have taken preventive measures."
Herod carefully stepped over broken glass, making his way to the bar. "The timing is... unfortunate."

"Unfortunate?" Rose laughed, the sound harsh and brittle. "They've ruined everything! My parents, who l controlled for years. Stefan, who I owned completely. All of them turning against me for Camille!"

She grabbed a half-empty bottle of wine and drank directly from it, red liquid spilling down her chin.

"And those journals! Those damned journals I thought I'd destroyed!" She slammed the bottle down. "How did they get them? How did they know what to say? Someone helped them. Someone gave them information."

Herod poured himself a whiskey, seemingly unbothered by her outburst. "Alexander Pierce, most likely. He's been surprisingly resourceful."

" want him destroyed too," Rose hissed, pacing like a caged animal. "Him, Camille, Victoria, my parents,Stefan, all of them. I want them to suffer for this humiliation."

She paused by the window, staring down at the street where reporters had gathered outside the building.News of her parents' accusations had spread quickly, drawing media vultures hoping to catch her reaction.

"I can't even leave," she whispered, a new note of panic entering her voice. "They're waiting for me down there. Cameras. Questions. All those people who believed me yesterday, now looking at me like I'm a monster."

Herod watched her,swirling his drink thoughtfully."Sit down, Rose."

"I don't want to sit!"she snapped. "I want to..."

"Sit. Down." His voice hardened, the casual facade dropping momentarily.

Something in his tone cut through her rage. Rose sank onto the edge of a chair, shoulders still rigid with fury.

Herod took the seat across from her."Do you know why most revenge plots fail?"

"I don't need a lecture," she seethed.
"Emotion," he continued as if she hadn't spoken. "Uncontrolled emotion leads to mistakes. Mistakes lead to failure." He sipped his whiskey. "What's happening right now is you losing control."

"They betrayed me!" Rose's fists clenched on her knees. "My own parents. Stefan.After everything..."

"Yes, yes, they're terrible people." Herod waved his hand dismissively. "The question is not whether you have the right to be angry. The question is whether your anger serves our purpose."

His calmn only infuriated her further. "How can you sit there so coldly? Kane Industries stock is recovering.Camille's reputation is being restored. Everything we worked for-"

"Is a minor setback," Herod cut in. "One battle in a larger war."

Rose laughed bitterly. "Easy for you to say. You're not the one they're calling a liar and manipulator on every news channel.Your life isn't being torn apart in public."

"No," Herod agreed, something flashing in his eyes. "That happened to me ten years ago, when Victoria Kane systematically destroyed my family. I know exactly how public humiliation feels."

He set his glass down carefully. "The difference is that I channeled that feeling into something productive. A plan. A purpose. Not..." he gestured at the destroyed room, "this childish tantrum."

Rose flinched as if he'd slapped her.

"Now," Herod continued, "we have two choices. We can abandon our efforts because of this setback, or we can accelerate to phase two."

Rose drew a shaky breath, struggling to pull herself together. "What exactly is phase two? You've been vague about the details."

"Because until now, you didn't need to know them." Herod stood and moved to his desk, retrieving a tablet from the drawer. "The Phoenix Grid project breaks ground in two weeks. The site is prepared, construction crews ready, permits secured."
He handed her the tablet, open to technical specifications. "These are the modified blueprints for the power distribution.nodes. Our contact inside Kane Engineering has already substituted them for the originals."
Rose stared at the diagrams, not understanding the technical aspects but recognizing the importance of what she was seeing. "So the project will fail?"

"Not immediately," Herod said, a thin smile appearing. "The system will operate perfectly during the demonstration and initial testing. The flaws will only manifest under full load conditions, approximately six to eight weeks after installation."

"And when it fails?"

"Catastrophically." He took the tablet back. "Not dangerous to human life, I'm not that reckless, but catastrophic from a business perspective. Complete system failure across multiple cities simultaneously.Hundreds of millions in damages. Stock collapse. Regulatory investigations."

Rose's breathing slowed as she absorbed his words. "And Camille takes the blame."

"As project head, she bears ultimate responsibility." Herod nodded. "Particularly when evidence emerges that early tests showed potential problems..... problems she supposedly ignored."

"Evidence you've manufactured," Rose guessed.

"Already planted in Kane Industries' secure servers, timestamped months ago." Herod looked pleased with himself. "When investigators dig, they'll find exactly what we want them to find."

Rose felt her anger transforming, cooling into something harder and more focused. "And the timing? After today's disaster, they'll be watching us more closely."

"Which is why we let them believe they've won." Herod moved back to his chair. "You disappear from public view. Retreat. Appear defeated. Let Kane Industries recover, let Camille bask in her vindication, let your parents think their betrayal saved their precious daughter."

He leaned forward. "And then, just when they feel safest, everything collapses around them."

Rose stared at the floor, seeing not the scattered debris of her outburst but the future Herod described.Camille's fall from grace. Victoria's empire crumbling. Her parents watching helplessly as the daughter they chose suffered public disgrace.
"How long?" she asked finally.

"Two months, perhaps three." Herod shrugged. "Patience is essential."

"And what about me? I can't even leave this building without being mobbed."

"You won't need to for a while." Herod gestured toward the room beyond. "The penthouse has everything you need.Food delivered. Private elevator. Security. Consider it a strategic retreat."

Rose stood, moving back to the window. Below, more reporters had gathered, their cameras pointed up at the building.

"They think they've won," she said softly, pressing her palm against the cool glass."Camille. Victoria.Alexander. My parents. Even Stefan. They're all celebrating right now, congratulating themselves on exposing me."

"Let them celebrate," Herod said, coming to stand beside her.Victory makes people careless. And we need them careless."

Rose turned to him, something new hardening in her expression. "Two months is a long time to wait for revenge."

"Not compared to ten years." Herod's voice carried the weight of his decade-long quest against Victoria."True revenge isn't about immediate satisfaction. It'sabout complete destruction. Taking everything from your enemy, not just their possessions, but their sense of security. Their trust in the world. Their belief in themselves."

His words resonated with something deep inside Rose, the part of her that had watched Camille from the shadows all these years, plotting, waiting, building toward the moment when she could take everything her sister had.

"We move to phase two," she said finally, herdecision made. "But I have conditions."

Herod raised an eyebrow. "Which are?"

"I want Camille to know it was me in the end. Not just suspect, but know with absolute certainty that l destroyed her again." Rose's voice strengthened. "And I want to be there when it happens. I want to see her face."

"Risky," Herod noted. "But possibly arrangeable."

"And my parents," Rose continued. "They don't just lose social standing. They lose everything. The house.Their money. Their reputations."

"Collateral damage is expected in war," Herod agreed smoothly.

Rose's mind cleared, her earlier rage transforming into cold determination. "And Stefan. I want him ruined most of all. He betrayed me after everything I did for him. Everything I sacrificed."

"Your priorities seem somewhat tangled," Herod observed. "I thought Camille was your main target."

"They all are," Rose said simply. "Different branches of the same tree. Cut them all down, burn the roots,salt the earth."

Herod studied her with new interest. "You continue to surprise me, Rose. MMost people underestimate the depths of your...commitment."

"Most people underestimate me entirely," she replied. "It's what makes them so easy to manipulate."

She looked around at the destroyed room, suddenly embarrassed by her earlier loss of control. "I apologize for the mess. I'll have it cleaned up."

"Don't bother." Herod dismissed her concern with a wave. "It's just things. Replaceable."

"Unlike reputations," Rose added, a thin smile forming. "Those, once truly broken, never quite recover."

Herod moved to his desk and pressed an intercom button. "Jackson, have the penthouse cleaned. And inform the security team downstairs that no press is to be allowed into the building under any circumstances."

He released the button and turned back to Rose. "Phase two requires preparation. We should begin immediately."
Rose nodded, the last embers of her rage cooling into resolve. The initial plan had failed, yes. But the war was far from over. Camille had survived the first attack, just as she had survived the parking garage.But this time,Rose wouldn't make the same mistake.

This time, she would destroy Camille so completely that no amount of support from Victoria Kane or Alexander Pierce could save her.

"What do we do first?" she asked.

Herod smiled, pleased by her renewed focus. "First, we disappear. Let the world think you've been defeated.Let them lower their guard."

"And then?"

"Then we strip away everything Camille values.... piece by piece. Her new identity. Her position at Kane Industries. Her relationship with Alexander. Her precious Phoenix Grid." His voice hardened. "By the time we're finished, she'll wish she had died in that parking garage."

Rose moved to the bar and poured herself a proper drink, leaving behind the half-empty wine bottle of her earlier frenzy. The smooth burn of whiskey steadied her as she raised her glass.

"To phase two," she said quietly. "And to complete destruction."

Herod clinked his glass against hers. "To patience. And to perfect timing."

Rose sipped her whiskey, letting the warmth spread through her chest. The day's humiliation still stung, but Herod was right. Emotion was a liability in a game like this. Cool heads prevailed. Patient predators caught their prey.

And Rose Lewis was nothing if not patient when it came to destroying her sister.
###Chapter 92

The private dining room at Per Se glowed with amber light, Manhattan's skyline twinkling beyond floor-to-ceiling windows. Camille swirled her wine, watching the deep red liquid catch the light. The remnants of their nine-course meal and two bottles of Bordeaux scattered across the table.

"To resurrection," Victoria said, raising her glass, platinum hair shimmering in the candlelight.

"To truth," Alexander added from beside Camille.

"To unexpected allies," Camille said, joining the toast with a delicate clink of crystal, thinking of her parents and Stefan defending her when she least expected it.

After days of crisis management, simply sitting and breathing felt like luxury.

"The board has officially reversed their position," Victoria said. "The emergency meeting lasted ten minutes.Gordon couldn't backpedal fast enough."

Alexander smiled. "Amazing how quickly principles dissolve when stock prices recover."

"They never had principles," Victoria replied. "Just fear. And fear is always temporary."

Camille observed them, two business titans who had circled each other warily for years, their usual tension softened by their common goal of protecting her.

"I still can't believe my parents did that," Camille said. "After everything, they actually stood up for me."

Victoria studied her. "Have you decided whether to return your mother's call?"

Camille shook her head. The voicemail remained unanswered.

"They took a significant risk," Alexander noted. "Publicly admitting they failed you.Exposing Rose."

"Why now, though?" Camille asked. "After years of choosing Rose, why stand with me when it might cost them everything?"

Victoria sipped thoughtfully. "People rarely change unless the cost of staying the same becomes unbearable."


"Or unless they finally see the truth," Alexander added, his eyes meeting Camille's. "Sometimes we don't recognize what matters until we nearly lose it."

The weight of his gaze made Camille look away, suddenly conscious of the current between them, unspoken but growing stronger. She focused instead on the skyline.

"Either way," she said finally, "it changes nothing about our plans. The Phoenix Grid launches in ten days.We move forward."

Victoria smiled slightly, approval evident. "Spoken like a true Kane."

"The permits came through for the Brooklyn site," Alexander said. "Construction crews begin tomorrow."

"And the Chicago location?" Victoria asked.

"Ready for phase one. The mayor wants to be present for the groundbreaking."

Camille felt excitement flutter beneath her ribs. The Phoenix Grid, her project, her vision, her chance to build something lasting.Clean, sustainable energy flowing through revitalized infrastructure.

"The testing results exceeded expectations," she said proudly. "Efficiency ratings fifteen percent higher than projected. WVe'll revolutionize urban power distribution."

Alexander's hand found hers under the table, a brief squeeze of understanding. He knew what this meant to her, not just business success, but personal transformation. For so long, her focus had been destruction.The Phoenix Grid represented something different. Creation. Legacy.

"The board has authorized the full funding package," Victoria said. "Eight billion for the initial three cities,with conditional approval for phase two."

"And Pierce Industries remains committed to the partnership," Alexander added. "Solar generation, offshore wind integration, and distribution protocols."
Camille felt gratitude toward them both, Victoria who had saved her and given her purpose, Alexander who had seen her potential.

"We're really doing this," she said softly.

"Did you doubt it?" Victoria raised an eyebrow.

"After this week? Maybe. For a moment there, it seemed like Rose might actually win."

Alexander's expression darkened. "She miscalculated. Attacking your mental stability without evidence was desperate."

"And where is Rose now?" Camille asked. "She's gone completely silent since the press conference."

Victoria signaled for coffee. "My sources say she hasn't left that building on Park Avenue. The one owned by that investment group."

"Chris Holdings," Alexander supplied. "A shell company, most likely."

Camille frowned. "You think she's hiding? That doesn't sound like Rose.She never retreats."

"Everyone retreats when they have no choice," Victoria said with certainty. "She's been exposed,humiliated. She's regrouping."

"Or planning something else," Camille murmured.

Alexander squeezed her hand. "If she is, she'll fail again. You have us now."

The waiter arrived with coffee. When he departed, Victoria leaned forward, her expression serious.

"Speaking of Stefan," she began, eyeing Alexander. "That press conference was remarkably well-timed."

Alexander met her gaze steadily. "One might think so."

"Almost as if someone had coordinatedVictoria pressed. "Someone with resources."

Camille looked between them. "What are you saying?"

"I'm wondering if Alexander has been making moves without consulting us," Victoria said coolly.
Alexander didn't flinch. "Would you have approved if I had consulted you?"

"That's not the point."

"It's precisely the point. Sometimes action must precede consensus."

Camille felt the tension returning. "You went to see Stefan. That's where you were when you called me."

Alexander nodded once. "I did."

"Why not tell me?"

"Because you wouldn't have approved either," he said simply."And we needed him. His testimony carried weight because he had no reason to defend you."

Victoria's expression remained neutral, but Camille sensed her disapproval. "Unilateral decisions are dangerous,Alexander."

"So is committee thinking during a crisis," he countered.

Camille raised a hand, stopping their brewing argument. "It worked. That's what matters. But next time, l want to know. Even if you think I'll disapprove."

Something flickered in his eyes, a mixture of apology and deeper emotion. "Fair enough."

Victoria watched this exchange with sharp attention. "Now that Rose has been neutralized,we should discuss security for the launch events."

"Already arranged," Alexander said. "Maximum coverage, minimum visibility."
0
Camille took a sip of coffee, letting the normalcy of project planning wash over her. This was what she wanted, to be defined by what she built, not by what had been taken from her.

"The Phoenix Grid changes everything," she said. "Cities that can't be blacked out. Communities that control their energy destiny. Real sustainability."

Alexander smiled warmly. "That vision is why I wanted to partner with Kane Industries in the first place."
"And now?" Victoria asked, her tone casual but her gaze piercing.

"Now the vision and the person behind it are equally compelling," he replied, not looking away from Camille.

The air between them thickened. Camille felt heat rise in her cheeks.

"The technical achievements will establish Kane Industriesas the leader in next-generation infrastructure,"she said, steering the conversation to safer ground. "The patents will transform the company."

Victoria allowed the deflection, though her knowing smile suggested she wasn't fooled."lndeed.Which is why the launch must be flawless."

"The engineering team has triple-checked everything," Camille assured her. "The system is solid."

"And beautiful in its eleganoAlexander added.

The waiter appeared with chocolate truffles. "Compliments of the chef, in celebration of Ms. Kane's return to public life."

Victoria raised an eyebrow. "Your vindication is already bearing sweet fruits."

Camille picked up a truffle. "Strange how quickly public opinion shifts. Yesterday I was unstable. Today I'm the wronged heroine."

"People love a comeback story," Alexander observed. "Especially one with villains as clear as Rose."

"And what happens when the next crisis hits?" Camille asked. "When someone else questions my stability?"

Victoria leveled her gaze. "You stand firm. You trust what we've built. You remember that you've survived worse."

"And you don't face it alone," Alexander added quietly.

The simplicity of his statement touched something raw in Camille's chest. After years of isolation, the concept of genuine partnership felt almost foreign.

"To not facing it alone," she said, raising her coffee cup.
When the meal ended, they stood at the private elevator. Victoria checked her watch.

"I have a late call with our Tokyo office," she said. "The car will drop me first."

Alexander helped her with her coat. "I can see Camille home."

Victoria's eyes moved between them, calculation evident. "I'm sure you can. Camille, I'l expect you at nine tomorrow for launch preparations."

Just before the elevator doors closed, Victoria fixed Alexander with a pointed look. "Remember what we discussed. Some games have higher stakes than others."

The cryptic warning hung in the air.

Camille turned to him. "What was that about?"

Alexander shook his head slightly. "Victoria being Victoria. Always three moves ahead."

"Of what?"

His eyes met hers. "Of everyone."

The second elevator arrived, and they descended together, awareness building between them.

"Thank you," she said suddenly. "For going to Stefan. For helping when I didn't know you were."

Alexander's expression softened. "I told you, I've been watching over you longer than you know."

"Why?" The question had lurked in her mind since she'd learned how he had tracked her recovery.

"Because from the moment I saw who you truly were, beyond the pain, I recognized something worth protecting. Something extraordinary."

The elevator slowed.

"Victoria worries you'll lose focus," Camille said, understanding. "She thinks this might distract from our plans."

"Victoria worries about everything she can't control," Alexander replied. "Including how people feel."
The doors opened to the lobby. Outside, his car waited.

"Can I take you home?" Alexander asked, his voice low.

The question carried weight beyond the simple words. Camille felt the crossroads, continued focus on Phoenix Grid and revenge, or something she hadn't allowed herself to consider since before Rose destroyed her life.

Connection. Possibility. Perhaps even love.

"Yes," she said finally. "I think it's time we talk. Really talk."

Alexander's smile transformed his face. "I've been waiting to hear you say that."

As they slid into the car, Camille felt something unfamiliar blooming in her chest, not cold determination,not burning rage, but something warmer and more fragile.

Hope.
###Chapter 93

Camille's phone buzzed against the boardroom table,its vibration cutting through her presentation. She glanced at the screen and felt her stomach drop.

"Excuse me," she said, her voice steadier than she felt. "Let's take a five-minute break."

As the engineering team filed out, Camille opened the alert.

*BREAKING: Kane.Industries (KI) down 8.7% on rumors of Phoenix Grid safety concerns*

She scrolled quickly to a financial blog post: "SOURCES CLAIM PHOENIX GRID POSES UNPRECEDENTED FIRE RISK."

The article cited "anonymous whistleblowers inside Kane Engineering" who allegedly provided documents showing the power distribution nodes could overheat under certain conditions. The claims were vague but specific enough to sound credible.

Camille called Victoria. No answer. She tried Alexander next.

"I've seeniit,"he said immediately. "PR is already crafting a response."

"Who would do this?" Camille demanded, pacing the empty boardroom. "Three days before groundbreaking? This isn't coincidence."⑤

Alexander agreed, his voice tight. "It's coordinated. The same story appeared simultaneously on four different financial platforms. Our stock dropped the moment markets opened."

Camille glanced at the wall of glass. Engineers huddled nearby, faces worried, stealing glances toward her.

"Get Hannah Zhao on this immediately," she ordered. "I want a comprehensive safety report ready by this afternoon-something clear enough for the media to understand."
"Already happening," Alexander assured her. "Victoria's called an emergency press conference for two o'clock."

Camille checked her watch: 10:17 AM. Less than four hours to contain a crisis.

미며 be there," she said. "I need to finish with the engineering team first."

"Camille," Alexander's voice softened. "This will pass. The Phoenix Grid is sound.We both know that."

She ended the call, took a deep breath, and opened the door to call back the engineers. Their anxious faces told her rumors had already spread.

"I assume you've all heard," she said directly. "Let me be clear: The Phoenix Grid design is sound. These allegations are baseless. But we will address them with facts, not defensiveness."

Hannah Zhao, the lead engineer, stepped forward. "The distribution nodes have been tested far beyond normal parameters. They simply cannot cause fires as described."

"Someone fabricated concerns," Camille agreed. "Our job now is to prove it. Hannah, I need your team to prepare a comprehensive safety assessment. Every test, every safety margin, every redundancy. Two o'clock deadline."

As the team dispersed, Hannah lingered behind.

"Ms. Kane," she said quietly, "these allegations contain technical details that only someone with inside knowledge could know."

The implication hung in the air. A leak. A betrayal from within.

"I'm aware," Camille replied."Let's focus on the facts first. We'll deal with how this happened afterward."

*****

Two floors below, Victoria Kane stood in her office, watching financial news coverage. The ticker showed Kane Industries down 11.3%. She held her phone to her ear.

"Find out who's behind this," she ordered. "Check trading patterns. Someone is profitingfrom this drop."
She ended the call as her assistant entered with printouts of every article mentioning the allegations.

"The technical team is preparing a detailed response," the assistant reported. "And Mr.Pierce is on his way."

Victoria scanned the articles. Something in the phrasing caught her attention, targeting not just the technology but subtly undermining Camille's judgment.

Her eyes narrowed. This had Rose's fingerprints all over it. But Rose had been in hiding since the press conference disaster. This attack was too well-orchestrated for Rose alone.

She had help. Significant help.

When Alexander arrived, Victoria didn't bother with greetings.

"This is a coordinated attack," she said, handing him the most damaging article. "Look at the technical specifics, someone with engineering knowledge helped prepare this."

Alexander scanned the document. "The details are close enough to our actual specs to sound legitimate,but with key differences."

"Suggesting?"

"Someone with partial knowledge," he concluded. "Not current blueprints, but perhaps earlier versions."

Victoria moved to the window. "I want every former employee with technical knowledge investigated. Every contractor,every consultant."

"Already underway," Alexander assured her. "Security is also checking for digital breaches."

"And Rose?" Victoria turned back. "What's she been doing since the press conference?"

Alexander shook his head. "Gone dark. No credit card usage, no phone activity. She's effectively disappeared."

"Nobody disappears that completely without help," Victoria observed. "Someone is sheltering her, funding her."

"The question is who," Alexander agreed. "And why target the Phoenix Grid specifically?"
Victoría's expression hardened. "Because it's Camille's project. Her vision. Her redemption. Attacking it is personal."
The Káne Industries press room buzzed with media activity. Television cameras lined the back wall as reporters filled every seat.

Camille stood backstage, reviewing her notes. Victoria beside her, both women dressed in nearly identical charcoal suits, a united front.

"Remember," Victoria said quietly, "no defensiveness. No anger. Just facts, confidence, and absolute certainty in our technology."

Alexander appeared, tablet in hand. "Hannah's report is ready. Comprehensive, clear, and irrefutable."

"Who leaked the specifications?" Camille asked, keeping her voice low.

Alexander shook his head. "Not yet. But the technical details weren't entirely accurate, close enough to seem legitimate, but with key differences."

"Meaning?"

"Someone with partial knowledge," he clarified. "Not a current insider with full access."

Camille's mind immediately went to Rose. "It's her. Rose is behind this."

Victoria's expression remained neutral. "Focus on the present crisis. We'll deal with the source later."

The lights seemed unnaturally bright as Camille approached the podium, Victoria and Alexander flanking her.



"Good afternoon," Camille began, her voice clear and strong."I'm here to address rumors regarding the Phoenix Grid technology. These allegations are categorically false, based on misunderstood or.deliberately manipulated information."

She gestured to the screen showing Hannah's safety report in simplified graphic form.
"The Phoenix Grid distribution nodes have been tested at three times maximum operational temperature without any safety concerns. The fire risk described is technically impossible given our design specifications."

A reporter called out: "Why would whistleblowers make these claims if there's no substance?"

Camille met his gaze directly. "We've found no evidence these 'whistleblowers' exist. These rumours appeared simultaneously across multiple platforms, a coordinated attack, not a genuine safety concern."

"Are you suggesting corporate sabotage?" another reporter asked.

"I'm stating facts," Camille replied coolly. "The Phoenix Grid has undergone rigorous testing by independent laboratories. Those results are publicly available."

She continued dismantling the allegations point by point. When technical questions arose, Hannah Zhao offered precise explanations that reassured without overwhelming the audience.

By the time the press conference ended, the stock had stabilized, regaining two percentage points.

As they exited, Alexander showed Camille his tablet, social media sentiment shifting as technical experts confirmed their safety claims.

"Crisis contained," he said, relief evident.

"For now," Camille replied,unable to shake her unease. "This was too well-planned to be a one-time attack."

Alexander nodded. "I've assigned a team to trace the source. If there's a connection to Rose, we'll find it."

"She's behind this," Camille insisted as they walked toward the elevator. "I can feelit."
)
"Even if she is," Victoria interjected, "Rose lacks the resources and technical knowledge to execute something this sophisticated alone."

The elevator doors closed, sealing the three of them in privacy.

"Then she has help," Camille said, frustration edging her voice. "Someone with money, influence, and a grudge against Kane Industries."
"That describes half of Wall Street," Victoria replied dryly.

Alexander's phone buzzed. He checked it, his expression turning grim. "Security reports unusual access attempts on out engineering servers last night. Nothing breached, but someone was probing for weaknesses."

Camille felt cold certainty settle in her stomach. "This is just the beginning, isn't it?"

Neither Victoria nor Alexander contradicted her.

** **

That evening, Victoria called Camille and Alexander to her private office. The large circular room, with its panoramic views of Manhattan, felt like a war room.

"The final damage report," Victoria began, sliding tablets across her desk. "Stock closed down six percent.Four institutional investors have expressed 'concerns' about the Phoenix Grid. Two regulators have requested additional safety documentation."

Alexander reviewed the information. "Better than we feared, worse than we hoped."

"The press conference helped," Victoria acknowledged. "But doubt has been planted."

Camille scrolled through the reports. "Has security made any progress identifying the source?"

"Nothing concrete," Victoria admitted. "But the timing is too perfect to be coincidence. Three days before groundbreaking,just as final preparations are underway."

"Someone knows our schedule intimately," Alexander added. "Someone with access to internal planning."

"We need to investigate everyone with access to the Phoenix Grid specifications,"Camille said."Current employees, former employees, contractors, suppliers."

"Already in progress," Victoria assured her. "But this feels personal, Camille. Targeted specifically at your project."

"Rose," Camille said, the name like acid on her tongue. "She's been silent too long. This is exactly her style,
wait until I feel secure, then strike where it hurts most."

Alexander leaned forward. "Rose lacks the technical expertise to understand the Phoenix Grid specifications."

"She doesn't need to understand them," Camille countered. "She just needs to find someone whno does."

Victoria's expression remained thoughtful. "The questionis how she's executing it, and who's helping her."

Alexander stood. "We should consider postponing the groundbreaking ceremonies."

"No," Camille said firmly. "That's exactly what they want. If we delay, it only validates the rumors."

Victoria studied her, approval flickering in her eyes. "Agreed. We proceed as planned, but with enhanced security."

"I want to find Rose," Camille said suddenly."Look her in the eye, see what she's planning."

"Too risky," Victoria responded immediately. "Drawing her out now could accelerate whatever. she's planning."

"Or disrupt it," Camille argued. "Rose has always been reactive. If she sees me unafraid, it might force her to make a mistake."

Alexander returned to the table. "If we could locate Rose, approaching her would need to be handled carefully."

Victoria's eyes narrowed. "You're considering this."

"I'm considering all options," he corrected. "Including that drawing Rose into the open might reveal who's 0backing her."

Camille felt a surge of gratitude toward Alexander. "We know Rose. She can't resist gloating. If I confront her directly, she'll reveal something, even unintentionally."

Victoria remained unconvinced. "And if it's a trap? If she wants you to find her?"

"Then we set a counter-trap," Camille replied. "But sitting here waiting for the next attack isn't working."
The three fell silent, each weighing the risks. Outside, darkness had fallen over the city.
"Find her," Victoria said finally. "But do not approach without a full security plan. And Alexander goes with you."
Camille nodded,accepting the conditions.
"Now," Victoria continued, "the Phoenix Grid groundbreaking proceeds in three days. I want hourly security checks at all sites, background rechecks on all personnel, and additional testing on every component."
"Already implemented," Alexander assured her. "Nothing will go wrong at the ceremony."
"See that it doesn't," Victoria replied, her tone leaving no room for failure. "The Phoenix Grid represents more than just a business venture. It's Camille's statement to the world, that she builds rather than destroys."
Camille felt the weight of Victoria's words. The Phoenix Grid wasn't just about energy distribution, it was about her transformation.

"We'll find who's behind this," she promised. "And we'll stop them."
Alexander reached for her hand under the table, a small gesture of support invisible to Victoria. "Together,"he added quietly.
Camille squeezed his hand in response, drawing strength from his presence. Rose might have help,resources, planning, but Camille had something stronger.
She had truth on her side. And she would not be defeated again.
"Let's get to work," she said, rising from her chair. "We have a groundbreaking to prepare for, and a sister to find."

Victoria nodded, herexpression warming slightly as she watched her protégé. "Tomorrow morning, eight o'clock. Full team briefing."
As Camille and Alexander left Victoria's office, uncertainty still hungin the air. But something else was there too, a renewed sense of purpose, of unity in the face of this invisible threat. Whatever came next, they would face it together.
###Chapter 94

Rose stepped onto the balcony of Herod'spenthouse, a glass of champagne catching the golden light of sunset.Below,Manhattan sprawled in all its glittering glory, oblivious to the small victory celebration taking place sixty floors above.

"To successful beginnings," Herod said, joining her with his own glass. The evening breeze ruffled his dark hair,softening his usually severe appearance.

"Six percent," Rose replied, satisfaction warming her voice."Six percent drop in a single day. Millions wiped from Kane Industries' value."

Their glasses clinked, crystal meeting crystal with a delicate ring. Rose sipped the expensive champagne,bubbles dancing on her tongue. The taste of revenge was even sweeter than the Dom Pérignon.

"You should have seen Victoria's face during that press conference,"she said, leaning against the railing."So controlled on the surface, but I know that look in her eyes. She's rattled."

Herod studied her, his expression curious. "You enjoy this, don't you? Not just the outcome, but the process. The game itself."

Rose considered this. "I never thought of myself as someone who enjoyed causing pain. But watching Camille squirm, seeing her precious project questioned..." She trailed off, surprised by the intensity of her feelings. "Yes,I enjoy it."

"Most people lie to themselves about such things," Herod observed, moving closer. "They pretend their revenge is only about justice, not pleasure."

"I stopped lying to myself a long time agRose replied. "When you grow up unwanted, you learn to see things clearly."

Something flickered in Herod's eyes, recognition, perhaps. Understanding. The setting sun cast half his face in shadow, half in golden light, emphasizing the sharp angles of his cheekbones.

"Your honesty is refreshing," he said.

Rose felt a strange flutter in her chest. For weeks, they had worked together with cold precision, their partnership purely transactional. But tonight, celebrating their first victory, something subtle had shifted in the air between them.

"Tell me something real about yourself," she said suddenly."Not about your family or Victoria Kane or business.Something I don't know yet."

Herod seemed surprised by the request. He turned to face the skyline, considering.

" collect first editions," he said finally. "Books from the 19th century, mostly. I find comfort in things that have survived their time, outlasted their creators."

The admission was unexpected, a small, human detail about a man who had revealed so little of himself beyond his thirst for revenge.

"Do you read them?" Rose asked. "Or just collect them?"

"Both. Some nights, when sleep won't come, I read by the window until dawn." He glanced at her. "Your turn.Something real."

Rose felt oddly vulnerable under his gaze. She was accustomed to crafting herself for others, the perfect daughter, the supportive sister, the devoted girlfriend. Revealing anything authentic felt dangerous.

"I can't swim," she admitted. "I nearly drowned as a child, before the foster system. I've never been able to put my head underwater since."

The words hung between them, more revealing than she'd intended. Not just a fact, but a weakness. A fear.

Herod didn't fill the silence with empty reassurances or prying questions. He simply nodded, accepting her truth as she had accepted his.

"We all have our depths we can't face," he said finally.
Inside, Herod's phone rang. He excused himself, stepping back into the penthouse. Rose remained on the balcony, watching darkness claim the city. Lights flickered on across Manhattan, creating new constellations against the deepening blue.

Through the glass doors, she observed Herod taking the call. His posture shifted subtly, straightening,tensing. Business mode. She'd learned to read his body language during their weeks of planning.Whatever news he was receiving, it was significant.

When he returned to the balcony, his expression had hardened back into the calculating mask she recognized from their strategy sessions.

"Good news?" she asked.

"Confirmation that phase two is ready," he replied. "Our contact at the engineering firm has implemented the modified specs in the Brooklyn site components. Everything appears exactly as it should, until full system load tests six weeks after installation."

Rose felt a familiar thrill of anticipation."And then?"

"Complete system failure. Harmless to humans, as promised, but catastrophic for Kane Industries'reputation. Especially when the 'overlooked' safety warnings surface."

Rose smiled, imagining the scene, Camille watching helplessly as her precious Phoenix Grid collapsed,taking her reputation with it.

"Perfect timing," she said. "Just as they recover from this week's crisis, just as they think they're safe..."

"The true damage arrives," Herod finished. "Patience rewards those who wait."
0
He refilled their champagne glasses, his fingers brushing against hers as he handed back her drink. The brief contact sent an unexpected warmth up her arm. Rose found herself noticing details she'd previously ignored, the precise way he moved, the subtle cologne he wore, the intensity in his dark eyes when they focused on her.

"Why did you agree to help me?" she asked abruptly. "You had your own plans for Victoria. Why include me?"
Herod considered her question carefully,"Initially? Strategy. Your knowledge of Camille's weaknesses, your personal connection to the situation, it was valuable."

"And now?"

Something shifted in his expression, a softening around the eyes, a slight tension at the corner of his mouth."Now I find our partnership has... additional benefits."

The implication hung in the air between them. Rose felt her heartbeat quicken. For so long, her relationships had been calculated moves in a larger game, Stefan, the men before him, each one a stepping stone to something else. Utility, not connection.

This felt different. Dangerous in a new way.

"We should celebrate properly," Herod said, breaking the tension. "Not just champagne on the balcony.Dinner,perhaps."

"Here?" Rose asked, gesturing toward the penthouse.

"No. Out. In public."

Rose stared at him. "I can't be seen. Not after the press conference disaster. Every reporter in the city would pounce."

"Not in New York," Herod clarified. "My jet is fueled and waiting at Teterboro. We could be in Montreal for dinner, back by morning. No one would know."

The spontaneity of the suggestion startled her. "Montreal? Tonight?"

"Why not? We've earned a moment of pleasure amid all this planning." His eyes held hers. "Unless you're afraid to leave your hiding place."

The challenge was subtle but clear. Rose felt something stir inside her, pride, defiance, and something else she couldn't quite name.

"I'm not afraid," she said firmly. "But this seems... impulsive. Not like you."
"Perhaps you don't know me as well as you think." A smile played at the cornêrs of his mouth. "I can be impulsive when the occasion warrants."

Rose found herself returning his smile, conscious of how rarely she'd done so genuinely in recent weeks.Most of her smiles were performances, caculated to achieve a specific effect. This one surprised her with fts authenticity.

"Montreal," she repeated, considering. "French food, anonymity, no press..."

"Freedom," Herod added. "Even if just for an evening."

The word resonated within her. Since the disaster at the Kane Foundation gala, she'd been living in shadows, moving between hotel rooms, avoiding public spaces, wvatching from afar as her carefully constructed life collapsed. The thought of stepping into the world again, even briefly, even far away, felt both frightening and exhilarating.

"Yes," she decided suddenly."Let's go."

Surprise flickered across Herod's face, as if he hadn't expected her to accept. It vanished quickly, replaced by pleasure."Excellent. Pack lightly. We leave in an hour."

As Rose turned to go inside, Herod caught her wrist gently. The unexpected contact froze her in place.

"One condition," he said, his voice lower than before. "Tonight, no talk of Camille, Victoria, or revenge. Just dinner, conversation, and whatever comes after."

The implication sent heat rushing through Rose's body. She met his gaze, searching for calculation or manipulation, the currencies she understood best. Instead, she found something more unsettling: genuine interest.

"Agreed," she said, her voice steadier than she felt.
###Chapter 95

Three hours later, Rose gazed out the window of a private dining room in Montreal's most exclusive restaurant. Snowfell gently outside, illuminated by street lamps and café lights. Inside, candles flickered on their table, casting warm shadows across fine linens and crystal.

"You seem surprised to be enjoying yourself," Herod observed, watching her over the rim of his wine glass.

Rose turned from the window. "I am, a little. I haven't thought about anything but revenge for so long. It feels strange to just... exist."

"Vengeance is consuming," Herod agreed. "It leaves little room for ordinary pleasures."

"Is that why you collect books? To remember there's life beyond revenge?"

He considered this. "Perhaps. Though I began collecting long before Victoria Kane entered my life."

Rose studied him in the candlelight. Without the hard edges of their planning sessions, Herod Preston revealed different facets, cultured, thoughtful, even charming in his precise way.

"Tell me about the brother you lost," shesaid softly.

Herod's expression tightened momentarily, then relaxed. "Charles was the better of us. Kinder. More idealistic. He believed in love, in goodness. I always saw the darker side of human nature."

"And yet Victoria targeted him first."

"Because he was connected to what she loved most, her daughter." Herod swirled the wine in his gglass."The cruellest revenge strikes not at you directly, but at what you cherish."

Rose thought of Camille, of the Phoenix Grid, of how precisely their attack had been aimed at what her sister valued most. "We're following her playbook, aren't we? Using Victoria's own methods against her."
"With improvements," Herod added. "Victoria acted from raw grief. WNe move with calculation, patience."

"A dangerous combination," Rose murmured.

"Indeed." Herod's eyes lingered on her face. "Especially in someone as naturally gifted at manipulation as you."

Rose might once have taken this as an insult. Tonight, she recognized it as appreciation, one strategist acknowledging another's skill.

"We all use the tools life gives us," she said. "I learned early that my face, my charm could open doors that remained closed to others. That people believe what they want to believe, see what they want to see."

"And what do you want me to see tonight?" Herod asked, leaning forward slightly.

The directness of the question caught Rose off guard. She was accustomed to men who accepted her carefully constructed personas without question, who never looked for the truth beneath the performance.

" don't know," she admitted, surprising herself with her honesty. "I'm not sure who I am when I'm not fighting, scheming, surviving."

"Perhaps that's what we're discovering tonight," Herod suggested."Who Rose Lewis is when the masks come off,"

Their dinner arrived, exquisite plates of food too artful to immediately disturb. The waiter poured more wine and retreated, leaving them in their cocoon of privacy.

"I've worn so many faces," Rose said after a moment. "The grateful adopted daughter. The supportive sister. The perfect fiancée. Sometimes I wonder if there's anything real left underneath."

"Thereis," Herod said with unexpected certainty. "I've seen it, in your rage, your determination, your refusal to accept defeat. Those aren't masks, Rose. That's you."

His words touched something deep within her, a recognition she hadn't expected. In Herod's eyes, her darkness wasn't something tohide but something to acknowledge, even celebrate.

"Most people only want the pretty lies," she said softly.
"I'm not most people." His voice carried a weight that made her look up from her plate. "I see your ruthlessness, your capacity for vengeance, and I find it... compelling."

The word hung between them, charged with meaning. Rose felt her pulse quicken. She was accustomed to Inspiring desire in men, but always for the mirage she created. Never for her true self, especially not the darkest parts.

"Why did you really bring me to Montreal?" she asked directly.

Herod set down his fork, considering his answer. "Because partnerships forged only in hatred rarely survive.Because I wanted to know if there could be more between us than shared enemies."

"And is there?" Rose challenged, though she already suspected the answer.

Instead of replying, Herod reached across the table, his fingers brushing hers in a touch too deliberate to be accidental."What do you think?"

Rose didn't pull away. The contact sent electricity up her arm, a sensation both foreign and familiar.How long had it been since she'd felt genuine attraction, not calculated seduction? With Stefan, with all the others, physical connection had been a tool, a means to an end.

This felt different. Unpredictable. Dangerous in ways that had nothing to do with their revenge plans.

"I think," she said carefully, "that mixing business and pleasure complicates things."

"Complexity doesn't frighten me," Herod replied. "Does it frighten you?"

The question was a challenge, and Rose had never backed down from a challenge in her life. She turned her hand beneath his, their palms meeting, fingers intertwining.

"NO,"she said simply.

Something shifted in Herod's eyes, a heat that matched what she felt building within herself. For a moment,they remained perfectly still, connected by that single point of contact, the air between them charged with possibility.

"Shall we skip dessert?" Herod asked, his voice lower than before.
Rose nodded, suddenly certain. "Yes."
Hours later, Rose stood at the window of Herod's Montreal apartment, watching snow blanket the city.Behind her, sheets lay tangled on the bed, evidence of boundaries crossed, new territories explored. She wrapped herself tighter in the silk robe he'd provided, her body still humming from his touch.

Herod appeared in the doorway, two glasses of whiskey in hand. The moonlight silvered his bare chest,highlighting the unexpected strength of his body. Rose accepted the offered drink, their fingers brushing in a gesture now loaded with new meaning.

"Having regrets?" he asked, noticing her pensive expression.

Rose shook her head. "No. Surprises, maybe, but not regrets."

"What surprises you?"

She considered the question, tryingto untangle the knot of emotions inside her. "That I can still feel something real. After everything, the press conference, losing my family, being publicly vilified, I thought I might be... empty inside, Just hatred and revenge left."

Herod stepped closer, close enough that she could feel the heat from his body.d now?"

"Now I don't know what I feel," she admitted. "Except that it's more than I expected."

He didn't reach for her, respecting the space she needed. Another surprise, the patience in his desire.

"This doesn't change our plans," he said, reading her unspoken concern. "If anything,it strengthens our 0alliance."

Rose turned to face him fully.that what this is? An alliance strengthened?"

A smile touched his lips. "Among other things."

She studied him in the moonlight, this man who had seen her darkness and found it beautiful. Who matched her ruthlessness with his own. Who understood revenge not as a passing emotion but as a calling, a purpose.

"When this is over," she said quietly, "when we've destroyed them all, what then?"

The question had been lurking in the back of her mind for weeks. After revenge, after victory, what remained? Who would she be when there was no one left to fight?

Herod set down his glass and finally reached for her, his hand cupping her cheek with unexpected tenderness. "Perhaps we find out together."

The suggestion opened a door Rose hadn't allowed herself to imagine, a future beyond vengeance,beyond the single-minded pursuit that had defined her recent existence. A future possibly shared with someone who knew her true nature and accepted it without judgment.

"Together," she repeated, testing the word, its weight and possibility.

His eyes held hers, dark and certain. "If you wish it."

Rose leaned into his touch, making her choice. "I do."

As his lips met hers, gentler than before, Rose felt something break and reform inside her, not weakness,but a different kind of strength. The knowledge that even in her darkest moments, she remained capable of connection. That perhaps revenge wasn't the only future awaiting her.

Tomorrow they would return to New York, to their carefu plans, to the destruction of Camille and all she held dear.The Phoenix Grid would still fail, Kane Industries would still crumble, and Rose would watch it all with satisfaction.

But tonight had changed something fundamental. Tonight had shown her that beyond the ashes of her revenge, something unexpected might grow. Something shared with a man whose darkness complemented her own.

As snow continued to fall outside, covering Montreal in pristine white, Rose surrendered tothe moment,to the feeling, to.the surprising truth that even as she plotted destruction, she remained capable of creating something new.
###Chapter 96

The city lights twinkled below Camille's penthouse like fallen stars trapped on earth. She stood at the floor-to-ceiling windows, arms wrapped around herself, watching the tiny cars move through the streets forty floors below. Behind her, Alexander poured two glasses of red wine, the soft gurgle of liquid filling the comfortable silence between them.

It had been three days since the press the Phoenix project has issue and they sorted it out. Three days of relative peace. The thought felt strange to Camille, peace was not something she had known since finding those divorcepapers twenty five months ago.

"Your thoughts seem far away," Alexander said, approaching with the wine glasses. His footsteps were quiet on the plush carpet.

Camille accepted the glass, her fingers brushing his. That small touch sent warmth spreading up her arm."Not far. Just... processing everything."

Alexander stood beside her at the window. Unlike many men who felt the need to fill silence, he seemed content to shae it with her. That was one of the many things she had come to appreciate about him.

"Victoria called earlier," Camille said after taking a sip of wine. "The latest reports show Kane Industries stock has fully recovered. The Phoenix Grid project is back on schedule."

Alexander nodded. "That's good news."

"Yes." Camille turned from the window. "But that's not what I want to talk about tonight."

She moved to the cream-colored sofa and sat down, tucking one leg beneath her. The softness of the cushions welcomed her tired body. Alexander followed, sitting close enough for comfort but with space between them, always respectful of her boundaries.

"What would you like to talk about?" he asked, his dark eyes studying her face.
Camille took a deep breath. "Us. This thing between us that we keep dancing around."

Alexander's expression remained calm, but she noticed how his fingers tightened slightly around the wine glass. "I was wondering when we'd have this conversation."

"Is that why you've never pushed?"

"Partly." He set his glass on the coffee table. "I didn't want to rush you. After everything with Stefan and Rose...I know trust doesn't come easily to you anymore."

The mention of their names didn't sting like it once had. Progress, Camille thought.

"For a long time," she began, staring into her wine, "I thought that part of me was dead. The part that could feel...this." She gestured between them.ctoria taught me to channel everything into revenge. To see people as pieces on a chessboard."

"And now?" Alexander's voice was quiet.

Camille looked up at him. "Now I find myself thinking about you when you're not there. Wanting to tell you things as soon as they happen. Wondering what you'd think about decisions I'm making." She paused. "It scares me."

"Why does it scare you?"

She set her glass beside his. "Because I trusted before, and it almost destroyed me. Because Victoria warned me not to let emotions cloud my judgment.Because I'm not sure who I am when I'm not fighting anymore."

Alexander shifted closer, close enough that she could smell his cologne, cedar and bergamot, nothing flashy.Like him.

"Camille," he said, her name soft on his lips,"doyou remember when we first met? At the hospital in Boston?"

She nodded slowly, memories stirring from a time that felt distant now, belonging to a different version of herself.
"I've known you longer than Victoria has," he continued gently. "I knew you before all this." He gestured to her current self. "I knew the real Camille, the woman with compassion and strength who saw beyond her own problemns."

Tears threatened at the corners of Camille's eyes. She blinked them back, unwilling to cry, a habit Victoria had trained out of her.

"The woman you're describing sounds like a stranger to me now," she confessed.

"She's not." Alexander reached out slowly, giving her time topull away if she wanted. When she didn't, he took her hand in his. "She's still there. I see her when you work on the Phoenix Grid, not just as revenge or to prove something, but because you believe in what it can do for people. I see her when you talk about the foundation you're building to help other women."

His thumb traced gentle circles on her palm. The simple touch sent waves of warmth through her entire body.

"That's why l've never pushed," he continued. "I wanted you to find your own way back to that woman. The one who doesn't just destroy, but builds. The one who doesn't just hate, but loves."

The word hung in the air between them. Love. Not spoken as a declaration, but as a possibility.

Camille fought the instinct to withdraw her hand, to retreat behind the walls Victoria had helped her build."What if that woman is gone for good? What if Victoria's creation is all that's left?"

Alexander shook his head. "She trained you to survive, to fight back. That was necessary. But Victoria Kane didn't create you, Camille. She helped shape you, but your core, who you truly are,that was always there."

He reached into his pocket and pulled out something small. When he opened his palm, Camille gasped.Lying there was a silver pendant in the shape of a delicate rose.

"You left this withAlexander said softly. "In the hospital. You said it would protect me like it had protected you."

Camille stared at the pendant. She remembered it now, a gift from her grandfather when she was sixteen.She had worn it every day until...
"I've kept it safe," Alexander said. "Waiting for the right moment to return it to you."

Her fingers trembled as she reached for the pendant. The familiar weight of it in her palm unlocked memories she had buried, of who she had been before the betrayals, before the pain.

"I don't know if I can be that woman again," Camille whispered.

"You don't have to be who you were," Alexander replied. "None of us can go backward. But you can bring the best parts of who you were into who you're becoming."

He moved closer, the space between them now just inches.

"I care about you, Camille. Not just Camille Kane, Victoria's creation. Not just Camille Lewis, the woman who was betrayed. All of you. Every version. Every layer."

The walls around Camille's heart, walls built through months of pain and rebuilding trembled. Not falling,not yet,but weakening.

"I don't want to make promises I can't keep," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I don't know if |can trust like that again."

"I'm not asking for promises," Alexander said. "Just... possibility. The chance to see where this goes,one day at a time."

Camille looked down at the silver rose pendant in her palm, then back up at Alexander. His eyes held no demands, only patient hope.

Something shifted inside her, not the calculated moves of a chess player Victoria had taught her to be,but something more organic. Growth pushing through concrete.

"One day at a time," she repeated. "I think I can manage that."

The smile that spread across Alexander's face warmed her more than the wine had. He lifted his hand,hesitated, then gently tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. The simple gesture made her breath catch.

"That's all I'm asking for," he said.
Outside, the city continued its nighttime dance of lights and sounds. But inside the penthouse,the world had narrowed to just the two of them, a man and woman finding their way toward each other through the wreckage of the past and the uncertainty of the future.

Camille looked at the silver rose pendant once more before closing her fingers around it. For the first time in longer than she could remember, the future held something beyond revenge. Something that felt dangerously like hope.

"Stay for dinner?" she asked, her voice steadier now. "I'm not much of a cook, but we could order in."

Alexander's smile deepened. "I'd like that very much."

As they moved to the kitchen to look through takeout menus, Camille felt lighter than she had in months.The path ahead was still uncertain, filled with threats from Rose, challenges with the Phoenix Grid, and her complicated relationship with Victoria. But for tonight, in this quiet moment with Alexander, she allowed herself to believe in possibilities beyond revenge.

And somewhere deep inside, in a place Victoria's training hadn't reached, the woman she used to be, the one who would sit with a stranger in a hospital, stirred to life again.
###Chapter 97

Rain lashed against the windows of Victoria Kane's office, matching her dark mood. She sat rigid in her leather chair, eyes fixed on the large screen mounted on the wall. The security footage playing before her sent ice through her veins despite the warmth of the room.

Martin, her head of security, stood nearby, his face grim as they watched Rose Lewis slip into a side entrance of an upscale restaurant. The timestamp showed 9:43 PM, two days ago.

"Pause it," Victoria commanded.

Martin pressed a button on the remote. The image froze, capturing Rose mid-step, her face partly hidden by large sunglasses despite the late hour. Even in disguise, the hatred Victoria felt for this woman burned in her stomach like acid.

"Continue."

The footage resumed. Rose moved through the restaurant, head down, until she reached a private dining area in the back. A waiter pulled aside a curtain, revealing a booth where someone already waited. The camera angle only showed the back of a man's head, dark hair, broad shoulders in an expensive suit.

"Can you get a better view of his face?" Victoria asked, leaning forward.

Martin shook his head."NO,ma'am. We've tried enhancing from every angle. The restaurant's security system isn't positioned to capture that corner clearly.It seems..."

"Deliberate," Victoria finished for him."As if they knew exactly where to sit to avoid identification."

"Yes,ma'am."

Victoria's fingers tapped against the polished wood of her desk, a habit she allowed herself only in moments of deep concern. "What else?"
Martin changed to another video feed. This one showed Rose and the mystery man leaving separately. First Rose, glancing nervously over her shoulder, then twenty minutes later, the man, still with his back to the camera,walking with the straight-backed confidence of someone used to command.

"We followed her?" Victoria asked.

"Yes. She went directly to her apartmen." Martin hesitated. "We tried to track the man, but he had a car waiting.Black Bentley, tinted windows, changed license plates twice before we lost him in Queens."

Victoria's eyes narrowed. Amateur mistakes weren't made by Martin's team. "He knew you were following."

"It appears so." Martin's professional pride seemed wounded. "Whoever he is, he has resources. And training."

Victoria stood, moving to the window. Below, New York sprawled out, glistening wet from the rain, lights blurred like watercolors. Somewhere in that vast city, Rose Lewis plotted with an unknown ally. The timing couldn't be coincidence, not with the Phoenix Grid groundbreaking ceremony only days away.

"Show me the other encounters," she ordered, turning back.

Martin pulled up four more video clips, different locations, different days. A coffee shop in Brooklyn. A bench in Central Park. The lobby of a hotel. A dock at the marina. Always the same pattern: Rose and the mystery man, faces hidden or obscured, meeting in locations that seemed random but Victoria recognized as strategically selected for minimal surveillance.

"They're planning something," Victoria murmured, more to herself than to Martin.

"Without question." Martin pulled out a tablet and handed it to her. "There's more. Financial records show Rose has accessed emergency funds we weren't aware of. Not much, two hundred thousand dollars, but enough."

Victoria swiped through the banking records, a cold knot forming in her chest. "And the man?"

"Nothing. No financial trail we can follow. Which suggests someone who knows how to cover his tracks."

The rain beat harder against the glass. Victoria felt her age today, the weight of it pressing down on her shoulders. She had lived through corporate wars, personal tragedies, and countless attacks on her empire.Her instincts had never failed her, and now they screamed danger.

"Where is Camille now?" she asked.

"At the engineering facility with Ms. Zhao, reviewing the final blueprints for the Grid. Mr.Pierce is with her."

At least she was safe, Victoria thought. Protected by Alexander's presence and his own security team. But for how long?

Victoria moved back to her desk and pressed the intercom. "Sarah, cancel my meetings for the rest of the day. And have the car ready in twenty minutes."

She released the button and looked at Martin. "I want our security doubled at the groundbreaking ceremony. Triple it around Camille without making it obvious. And I want every second of Rose's day tracked, where she goes, who she meets, what she buys."

"Yes, ma'am." Martin's expression remained neutral, but Victoria caught the faintest flicker of concern in his eyes."And the man?"

"Find him," Victoria said, her voice going sharp as a blade."Whatever it takes."

Martin nodded and left the office. Alone, Victoria pulled open her desk drawer and removed an old photograph, herself and Sophia, thirteen years ago, at the hospital fundraiser where Sofia had met Charles Preston.

The ache in her chest surprised her. Victoria Kane did not indulge in regret, it was unproductive, wasteful.Yet lately, watching Camille begin to open her heart to Alexander, seeing glimpses of the woman she had been before Rose's betrayal, Victoria wondered about the costs of her methods.

"Necessary," she whispered to the empty room. Everything had been necessary. The surgery. The training.The calculated revenge. She had forged Camille into a weapon that could strike back at those who had tried to destroy her.

But weapons, once created, didn't always stay in the hands that made them.
Her phone buzzed with a message from Alexander:

*Camille found inconsistencies in the Grid blueprints. Minor but concerning. Someone may have tampered with them. Hannah investigating.*

Victoria's breath caught. More evidence of a coordinated attack. She texted back:

*Keep her close. Coming to you now.*

She grabbed her coat and moved toward the door, then paused, turning back to look once more at the frozen image on the screen, Rose and the shadow of a man whose face they couldn't capture.

"Who are you?" she asked the figure. "And what game are you playing?"

The image, of course, gave no answer. But Victoria felt something she hadn't experienced in years, a flutter of unease. Not fear, never fear. But a premonition that patterns were shifting, that variables she hadn't accounted for were entering her carefully calculated equations.

For the first time since taking Camille under her wing, Victoria wondered if she might be outmaneuvered.The thought sent a chill through her that had nothing to do with the rain-cooled air.

In her private elevator descending to the garage, Victoria pressed her palm against the hidden scanner,granting access to the secure communications system built into the wall.

"Connect me to Alexander Pierce.Encrypted line."

A soft beep, then Alexander's voice filled the small space. "Victoria."

"Can you speak freely?"

"Yes.Camille is with Hannah reviewing the altered sections of the blueprints. We're alone."

Victoria kept her voice low despite the elevator's secure design. "We have a situation. Rose has been meeting with someone, a man. We can't identify him."

A pause. "Someone helping her target the Grid?"
"It seems likely. The timing, the secrecy. My security team couldn't track him, he knew they were following."

"Professional."

"Yes." Victoria watched the floor numbers tick down. "Alexander, I've never asked about the full extent of your resources.I know they're substantial. More substantial, perhaps, than you've officially disclosed."

Another pause, longer this time. "What exactly are you asking, Victoria?"

"Your surveillance capabilities. They exceed standard corporate security,don't they?"

The elevator reached the garage level but Victoria pressed the hold button, keeping the doors closed.

"They do," Alexander admitted finally.

"Then I need you to find this man. Identify him. My team can't, and we're running out of time."

"You're asking me to use methods that aren't strictly legal."

Victoria smiled thinly at his careful phrasing. "I'm asking you to protect Camille. By any means necessary."

The silence stretched between them. When Alexander spoke again, his voice had hardened. "I'll find him.
But Victoria, this is for Camille, not for you. I need you to understand the distinction."

The words stung more than Victoria would admit. "Just do what needs to be done. And Alexander?"

"Yes?"

"Don't tell Camille about this yet. Not until we know what we're facing. She needs to focus on the Grid."

"She won't appreciate being kept in the dark."

"She'll appreciate being blindsided by another attack even less." Victoria's tone left no room for debate."Twenty-four hours. Give me that before you tell her."

"Twenty-four hours," Alexander agreed reluctantly. "But not a minute more. I won't lie to her."

Victoria ended the call and released the hold button. The elevator doors slid open to reveal her waiting car.As she stepped out, her phone buzzed again. A text from Martin:
*Rose just entered Madison Park. Meeting someone. Team in position.*

Victoria slid into the back seat of her car. "Change of plans, James. Madison Park. As quickly as possible."

The driver nodded, pulling smoothly out of the garage into the rain-slick streets. Victoria stared out at the passing city, her mind racing ahead, calculating risks and countermoves. Rose Lewis was a snake,dangerous but predictable in her hatred. But this new player, this shadow man with resources and training...he was the true threat.

Victoria had spent a lifetime anticipating her enemies' moves before they made them. It was how she had built her empire, how she had survived when others fell. But this felt different. The pieces on the board were moving in patterns she couldn't quite grasp.

For Camille's sake; she needed to see this enemy's face. Understand his motives. Know his weaknesses.

The car sped through the rainy streets, carrying Victoria toward Madison Park and perhaps, toward answers.But as the familiar skyscrapers of midtown gave way to the lower buildings surrounding the park, the knot in her chest tightened.

She couldn't shake the feeling that for once in her long career of calculated risks and strategic victories,Victoria Kane might be too late.
###Chapter 98

Rose stared at the screens covering the wall of Herod Preston's penthouse office. Six displays showed different angles of the Phoenix Grid construction site, live feeds that shouldn't exist. Workers in yellow hard hats moved across the site like ants, unaware of the predatory eyes watching their every move.

"Your security access is impressive," Rose said, stepping closer to examine a monitor showing the main control center where engineers hunched over computers. "How did you get these feeds?"

Herod's mouth curled into the barest hint of a smile. "Money opens doors. Especially when those doors belong to underpaid security guards with gambling debts."

He stood beside her, close enough that she could smell his expensive cologne. In the three weeks since they'd begun working together, Rose had grown to appreciate his attention to detail. Unlike the men she'd manipulated before, Herod Preston understood the value of patience. Of precision.

"And our man?" she asked, tapping a fingernail against the screen showing workers installing circuit panels.

Herod pressed a button on his desk. The center screen zoomed in on a thin man with ginger hair tucked under his hard hat. "James Walsh. Senior electrician. Twenty years' experience. Divorced. Two children he rarely sees. Massive debt from his ex-wife's medical bills."

Rose studied the man's face. Ordinary. Forgettable.Perfect.

"And he's completely bought in?"

"He believes he's working for a competitor looking to delay the project." Herod's voice carried the confident tone of someone who had covered every angle."He has no idea what will really happen when those modified circuits overload."

Rose felt a thrill race through her body. Not just excitement, something deeper. More primal. For twelve months she had lived in the wreckage of her carefully constructed life. Watching her fashion empire crumble. Feeling her grip on Stefan weaken. All because Camille refused to stay dead.

Now, finally, revenge was within reach.

"Show me the blueprint modifications again," she said.

Herod slid a tablet across his glass desk. On screen, two sets of technical drawings appeared side by side.To Rose's untrained eye, they looked identical, a maze of lines, symbols, and measurements.

"The original is on the left," Herod explained, pointing to specific sections. "Our version is on the right. The changes are subtle. Temperature sensors adjusted to report normal readings even when heat levels rise dangerously. Circuit breakers modified to allow power surges rather than shutting down. Backup systems reconfigured to fail simultaneously rather than sequentially."

Rose didn't fully understand the technical details, but she understood thé result. "And these changes guarantee disaster?"

Herod nodded, eyes gleaming with something that looked unnervingly like excitement. "The system will appear to function normally during testing. The flaws won't activate until full power runs through the grid for at least seventy-two hours. By then, the heat buildup in the main junction boxes will be unstoppable."

"And the result?"

"Catastrophic failure. Multiple explosions across the grid network. Blackouts throughout the city. And most importantly..." he tapped the screen where Camille's office was located at the Grid headquarters,"....complete destruction of Kane Industries' reputation. Your sister wilI be blamed for cutting corners on safety protocols. There will be investigations. Lawsuits. Criminal charges."

Rose closed her eyes, savoring the mental image. Camille in handcuffs. Victoria Kane's empire crumbling.Everything they'd built reduced to ashes.

"The timing is critical," Herod continued, moving to the window overlooking the Manhattan skyline. "Walsh installs the modified circuits tomorrow. Final testing begins the day after. The groundbreaking ceremony is in three days."

"And then?" Rose joined him at the window.
"And then we wait." Herod's reflection in the glass looked almost predatory. "Three days after the ceremony,the grid goes fully operational. Seventy-two hours after that..."

"Boom," Rose whispered.

"Precisely."

Rose tried to picture Camille's face when she realized what was happening. Would she know immediately that Rose was behind it? Or would the confusion and panic keep her from seeing the truth until it was too late?

"There's one more thing we need to discuss," Herod said, turning away from the window."Walsh."

Rose frowned. "What abouthim?"

"He's a loose end. After the installationis complete, he needs to disappear."

The coldness in Herod's voice sent an unexpected chill through Rose. She had wished Camille dead,had hired men to frighten her into leaving town, but hearing Herod speak so casually about eliminating a man whose only crime was being desperate enough to take their money...

"Is that necessary?" she asked, surprising herself with the question.

Herod studied her face, his expression unreadable. "Having second thoughts, Rose? That seems unlike you."


His tone held a challenge Rose couldn't afford to fail. She straightened her spine, raising her chin."Not at all. I'm simply being practical. A dead electrician raises questions."

"A dead electrician in a car accident fifty miles from New York raises no questions at all. Particularly when his blood alcohol level suggests he was drinking heavily." Herod returned to his desk. "That's already arranged. I simply thought you should know."

Rose nodded, swallowing the unexpected discomfort. This was war. Wars had casualties.

"Any word on Victoria's movements?" she asked, changing the subject.
Herod tapped another button. A new screen appeared showing Victoria Kane leaving her building, flanked by security. "She's increased surveillance on you. My sources say her security chief is frantically trying to identify me."

"Will they succeed?"

"No." Herod's confidence seemed absolute. "By the time they figure out who I am, it will be far too late."

Rose moved to the desk where several phones lay in a neat row. "And these are ready?"

"Yes. Untraceable. Use a different one for each call. Destroy them afterward." He picked up one of the phones. "The encrypted messaging app is already installed. Our communications will leave no trace."

Rose took the phone, their fingers brushing. The contact sent electricity up her arm, a different kind of thrill than thoughts of revenge. For a moment, neither pulled away.

"You've thought of everything," Rose said softly.

"That's why I survived when my family didn't. Why I rebuilt while Victoria thought she had destroyed us completely." Herod's voice dropped lower. "Never underestimate the power of patient hatred, Rose. It burns cleaner than any other fuel."

Rose understood.Hadn't she nursed her own hatred for Camille since childhood? Hadn't she plotted for years to take everything her sister had?

"So we're set," she said, pocketing the phone. "Nothing left but to watch it unfold."

"Almost nothing." Herod opened a drawer and removed a small box.ne final touch."

Inside the box lay a silver pin shaped like a phoenix rising from flames, identical to the emblem Camille wore constantly.

"A gift from an anonymous donor to every major news outlet in the city," Herod explained. "Arriving the morning after the explosions, with a note suggesting they investigate whether Kane Industries knew about safety concerns before the grid went online."

Rose picked up the pin, turning it in the light. sister does love her symbols."
"And symbols are powerful. Especially when they're turned against you." Herod closed the box. "The phoenix that rises from these ashes will be us, Rose. Not Camille Kane."

Rose felt dizzy with anticipation. After months of humiliation, of watching Camille rise from the dead to claim a new identity and destroy everything Rose had built, the tables were finally turning.

"What will you do?" she asked Herod."After?"

"Acquire what remains of Kane Industries at pennies on the dollar. Rebuild it in my own image." His eyes met hers."And you?"

Rose hadn't thought that far ahead. Her focus had been so completely on destruction that she'd given little consideration to what came after. "I haven't decided," she admitted.

Herod studied her face for a long moment."Perhaps," he said slowly,might discuss possibilities. Over dinner."

Rose blinked, caught off guard by the suggestion. "Dinner?"

"Tonight. My private chef makes an exceptional coq au vin." His tone remained businesslike,but something in his eyes suggested more than simple collaboration. "We should celebrate our imminent success."

Rose found herself nodding before she had fully processed the invitation. "I'd like that."

Herod's smile was brief but genuine. "Excellent. Eight o'clock." He glanced at his watch. "But first, we should check in with our electrician. He should be installing the critical components within the hour."

He pressed a button on his desk phone. "Bring the car around."

Rose gathered her coat, her mind racing with unexpected thoughts. The plan was perfect. Camille would lose everything, her reputation, her freedom, possibly even her life if she happened to be in the wrong place when the grid failed. Victoria Kane would watch her empire crumble, just as she had once destroyed the Preston family.

Yet as she followed Herod to the elevator, Rose found herself thinking not of revenge, but of dinner. Of the way Herod's eyes had lingered on hers. Of the possibility that destroying Camille might be not an end,but a The elevator doors closed, carrying them downward. They stood side by side, not touching but somehow connected by the invisible threads of shared purpose. Of mutual destruction turned to potential creation.

"You're smiling," Herod observed.

"Am l?" Rose hadn't realized. "I suppose I'm just looking forward to seeing Camille's face when she realizes who destroyed her."

Herod corrected quietly."Who destroyed her."

Rose met his gaze in the mirrored wall of the elevator. For the first time in longer than she could remember,she didn't feel alone in her hatred. Didn't feel like the only one who saw through Camille's perfect facade.

"Yes," she agreed as the elevator reached the ground floor.

Outside, a sleek black car waited, engine running. As Rose slid into the leather seat, she realized something else unexpected, beyond the thrill of coming revenge, beyond the strange new connection with Herod, she felt alive. Truly alive.

Soon Camille would know how it felt to lose everything. To watch your world burn around you while those you trusted turned away. To fall from the heights Rose herself had been pushed from.

And from those ashes, perhaps something new would rise after all. Something Rose hadn't dared to imagine.



Not just vengeance.

But victory.


###Chapter 99:

Morning sunlight bathed the construction site in golden light as hundreds gathered for the Phoenix Grid groundbreaking ceremony. Camera crews swvarmed like bees, jostling for position around the stage erected at the center of what would soon become the most advanced power distribution hub in the country. Massive red banners bearing the Kane Industries logo and the Phoenix Grid emblem fluttered in the spring breeze.

Behind the stage, in a temporary structure serving as a preparation area, Camille stared at her reflection in a full-length mirror. Her cream-colored suit was impeccable, her makeup flawless, the perfect corporate image Victoria had taught her to project. Yet beneath this polished exterior, unease churned in her stomach.

Hannah Zhao, the chief engineer, poked her head through the doorway. "Five minutes, Ms. Kane."

Camille nodded, adjusting the phoenix pin on her lapel. Even after discovering the blueprint discrepancies,Victoria had insisted the ceremony proceed as planned. "We don't show weakness," she had declared."We adapt.We strengthen what was vulnerable. And we never, ever let our enemies know we've spotted them."

The door opened again. Alexander entered, handsome in a navy suit, his presence immediately filling the small space.

"Nervous?" he asked, coming to stand behind her.

Their eyes met in the mirror. "Not about the speech," Camille admitted. "But knowing Rose is out there somewhere,watching,planning..."

Alexander rested his hands lightly on her shoulders. Through the fabric of her suit jacket, his touch sent warmth spreading across her skin.

"We've triple-checked the modifications to Hannah's designs," he reminded her. "The sabotage attempt failed. The Grid is safe."

"For now." Camille turned to face him. "But Rose won't stop. Neither will her mystery partner. And we still don't know who he is."

Alexander's jaw tightened. "My team is close to identifying him. Very close."

"You'll tell me as soon as you know?"

"Immediately," he promised, though something flickered in his eye, a hesitation so brief Camille almost missed it.

A production assistant tapped on the door. "Ms. Kane? We're ready for you."

Camille took a deep breath, centering herself. Alexander caught her hand.

"Remember," he said softly, "this is about more than beating Rose. This is your vision. Your creation."

She squeezed his fingers, drawing strength from his steadiness. "Our creation," she corrected.

Together they walked out into the sunlight, where hundreds of faces turned toward them. Camera flashes popped like lightning strikes. Reporters called out questions that blended into unintelligible noise. On the stage, Victoria stood at the podium, commanding attention with her mere presence despite her recent haggard appearance.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Victoria's voice rang out over the crowd. "Today marks not just the beginning of a revolutionary power grid that will transform New York's energy future. It also represents the culmination of a vision, a vision carried forward by my daughter and heir, Camille Kane."

Victoria gestured toward Camille, who ascended the steps to wild applause. For a heartbeat, standing beside Victoria, Camille flashed back to twenty three months ago, broken, bleeding in a parking garage, her life shattered by betrayal. The journey from that moment to this stage seemed impossible, yet here she stood.

As Victoria stepped aside, Camille approached the microphone. The crowd hushed. Hundreds of eyes fixed on her face. Somewhere in that sea of humanity, Camille knew, Rose might be watching. Waiting for her to fail.

"Thank you all for coming today," Camille began, her voice steady despite the storm of emotions inside her.
"The Phoenix Grid represents more than sustainable energy. It embodies something | believe in deeply,ttransformation."

In the front row, Alexander watched her, his presence a silent anchor. Beside him sat the mayor, the governor, and tech industry titans who had invested in the project.

"We named this project after the phoenix for a reason," Camille continued. "In mythology, the phoenix burns completely, reduced to ashes, yet rises again, not just restored, but made stronger by the very firethat consumed it."

Her eyes swept across the crowd, making brief contact with individuals, connecting with them just as Victoria had taught her.

"Many of you know that Kane Industries faced challenges bringing this project to fruition. There were those who said it couldn't be done. Those who actively worked against us."

A murmur ran through the crowd. Everyone remembered the stock manipulation, the media attacks, the sabotage attempts that had made headlines.

"But like the phoenix, we didn't just survive those challenges, we transformed them into opportunities.Each obstacle forced us to innovate, to strengthen our designs, to build something better than we had originally conceived."

Camille paused, letting her words sink in. In the distance, beyond the crowd, she caught sight of a flash of movement, a woman with dark glasses slipping behind a construction vehicle. Her heart jumped.Rose?

She forced herself to continue, refusing to show any reaction. "The Phoenix Grid will revolutionize how this city powers itself. Clean energy, inelligently distributed, with backup systems that ensure no neighborhood experiences blackouts while others have excess capacity."	0

The technical portion of her speech continued for several minutes, detailing the Grid's innovations.Throughout, Camille maintained her poise, though her senses remained hyperalertfor any sign of Rose in the crowd.

Then she shifted tone, her voice becoming more personal. "But today, I want to speak not just about energy transformation, but about personal transformation."
The crowd stilled, sensing the change.

"Many of you have experienced moments when everything you counted on vanished. When the life you built seemed to crumble beneath your feet."

In the front row, Alexander leaned forward slightly, his eyes never leaving her face.

"Those moments, the ones that burn us down to our foundations, they're terrifying. They're painful."Camille's voice softened. "But they also offer us rare gifts. The chance to rebuild. To rise from our own ashes as something stronger, wiser, more resilient than before."

Her hand reached up to touch the phoenix pin at her lapel.

"Second chances don't erase our scars. They don't undo the past. But they allow us to use that past,all of it,the painful parts especially, as fuel for something new. Something better."

In that moment, Camille wasn't speaking as Camille Kane, Victoria's carefully crafted heir. She was speaking as herself, the woman who had lost everything and still found a way forward.

"The Phoenix Grid represents Kane Industries' commitment to sustainable energy. But it also symbolizes something I believe in my soul, that transformation isn't just possible. It's inevitable, if we have the courage to embrace it."

Applause erupted, scattered at first, then building to a thunderous wave. Victoria, standing to the side,nodded once, a gesture of approval that meant more to Camille than the crowd's reaction.

"And now," Camille said when the applause subsided, "I'd like to invite Alexander Pierce, whose company has been instrumental in developing the revolutionary solar technology that powers the Grid, to join me for the official groundbreaking."

Alexander mounted the stage in a few graceful strides. Standing beside Camille, he seemed to belong there,his quiet strength complementing her fire.

"The Phoenix Grid represents the future,"Alexander said into the microphone, his deep voice carrying across the crowd. "But it also represents what happens when visionaries come together. Kane Industries brought unparalleled engineering expertise. Pierce Enterprises contributed next-generation solar technology. Together, we've created something neither could have achieved alone."

His eyes shifted to Camille, and something in his gaze sent heat rushing to her cheeks.

"Some partnerships are simply meant to be," he added, the double meaning clear to anyone watching. A ripple of whispers spread through the crowd as cameras clicked frantically, capturing the moment.

Victoria stepped forward, breaking the tension. "And now, for the official groundbreaking."

Three golden shovels waited at the edge of the stage. Victoria, Camille, and Alexander descended the steps together, moving to the prepared patch of earth marked with the Phoenix Grid logo.

Together, they plunged the shovels into the ground, turning over the first symbolic scoop of dirt as cameras flashed and the crowd applauded. Alexander's shoulder pressed briefly against Camille's, a touch that felt oddly intimate despite the hundreds of witnesses.

"Ladies and gentlemen, the Phoenix Grid!" Victoria announced.

The celebration continued for another hour, interviews, photos, congratulations from politicians and business leaders. Through it all, Camille maintained her professional demeanor, though her eyes occasionally scanned the crowd for any sign of Rose.

Finally, as the event wound down, Camille found herself alone with Alexander near the edge of the construction site.

"You were magnificent," he said quietly. "Your speech about transformation, it wasn't just words for you,was it?"


Camille shook her head. "No. Every syllable was real."
0

He reached for her hand, not caring who might see. "I meant what I said too. About partnerships meant to be."


Before she could respond, Victoria approached, her face tight with controlled tension.

"Security spotted Rose," she said without preamble. "At the back of the crowd during your speech. She was with someone, a man but they disappeared before we could intercept them."
Camille's momentary peace shattered."Did you identify him?"

"No." Victoria's mouth formed a grim line. "But Martin is reviewing the footage now. She wouldn't have come unless she had some purpose, some plan."

Alexander's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, his expression darkening."|need to take this," he said to Camille. "It's about that matter we discussed."

He stepped away, speaking in low tones into his phone. Victoria watched him go, something unreadable in her eyes.

"He's hiding something," Camille said softly.

Victoria nodded. "Yes. But the question is whether he's hiding it from us, or for us."

Camille turned to scan the construction site where workers were already beginning preliminary work,unaware of the drama unfolding around them. Somewhere in that massive project, Rose had tried to plant the seeds of destruction. Had they truly found all the sabotage attempts? Or was something still waiting,hidden deep in the systems,ready to trigger catastrophe?

The day had been perfect, the ceremony flawless, her speech powerful, Alexander publicly by her side. Yet as the sun began its descent, casting long shadows across the construction site, Camille couldn't shake the feeling that this was merely the calm before a storm whose scope she had yet to fully grasp.

Alexander returned, his face carefully composed but tension evident in the set of his shoulders.

"What is it?" Camille asked.

He glanced at Victoria before answering."We've identified Rose's partner."

Victoria stepped closer."Who?"

Alexander took a deep breath. "Herod Preston."

The name meant nothing to Camille, but Victoria's face went so pale Camille feared she might faint.

"Preston?" Victoria whispered. "That's impossible. The Prestons are gone. I made sure of it."
"Not all of them," Alexander said grimly. "Not Herod."

Victoria gripped Camille's arm with fingers that suddenly seemed bony, fragile. "If Herod Preston is helping Rose, this isn't about you anymore, Camille. It's about me. About Sophia."

"Who is he?" Camille demanded. "What does he want?"

Victoria's eyes, usually so calculating and cool, now burned with something Camille had never seen there before,raw fear.

the brother of the man who killed my daughter,"\Victoria said."And if he's working with Rose, then this isn't sabotage. It's annihilation."
###Chapter 100

Victoria's hands shook as she poured herself a drink in her office. The setting sun cast long shadows across the room. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, New York City sparkled, unaware of the storm brewing among its towering buildings.

"Herod Preston," Victoria whispered the name like a curse, staring into her glass. "After all these years..."

Camille had never seen Victoria like this, unsteady, shaken to her core. Since Alexander had revealed Rose's partner at the groundbreaking, Victoria had barely spoken, rushing them back to Kane Industries headquarters with security doubled.

"You need to tell me everything," Camille said. "Who is he? What does he want?"

Victoria drained her glass in one swallow. "Herod Preston is the younger brother of Charles Preston. The man who was engaged to my daughter Sophia before her death."

She set her glass down with a sharp click.

"Charles Preston's family owned Preston Shipping, once a rival to Kane Industries. They were old money,very powerful. They didn't approve of Charles marrying Sophia. When they couldn't break the engagement,they arranged her car accident."

Alexander stood by the window, listening silently.

"You told me this before," Camille said softly. "You took revenge on them. Destroyed their company."

Victoria's laugh held no humor. "I did more than that. I made sure every Preston lost everything. Charles committed suicide six months after Sophia's death. Their father drank himself to death a year later." She paused. "But Herod... he was just nineteen when it happened. Away at college. I didn't pay much attention to him."
"But he blames you for what happened to his family," Alexander said.

Victoria nodded. "Apparently. I heard he dropped out after his father died. Disappeared. I assumed he'd gone abroad, living on whatever scraps the family had hidden away."

"Alexander, what did your sources find?" Camille asked.

Alexander crossed the room, pulling upfiles on his tablet. "Herod Preston has been operating under various aliases for the past decade. He built a fortune in Asia, property development, mostly. Very successful.Very quiet. He returned to the States two years ago and has been buying up companies through shell corporations."

"How did he find Rose?" Camille asked.

"More likely she found him," Victoria said. "Rose has always had a talent for sniffing out useful allies.And someone hungry for revenge against me would be irresistible to her."

Camille rose from her chair. "So this isn't just about me anymore. Rose brought Herod into this because he wants to hurt you. By targeting the Phoenix Grid, he strikes at both of us."

Victoria's eyes met Camille's. "Yes. And Camille, I'm sorry. I've put you in danger. Again."

The raw pain in Victoria's voice stripped away years of her carefully constructed armor. In that moment, she wasn't the powerful CEO, the vengeful mother, the calculating mentor. She was simply a woman frightened of losing another daughter.

Camille crossed the room and knelt beside Victoria's chair, taking her cold hands. "No. Don't you dare blame yourself. Rose is my fight. She's been my fight since she tried to kill me."

"But Herod..."

"Herod made his choice when he partnered with Rose. When he targeted the Phoenix Grid." Camille squeezed Victoria's hands. "We've faced enemies before. We'll face this one too."

Victoria shook her head. "You don't understand. The Prestons were different. Charles was... unstable.Brilliant but unhinged. Herod was always the same, quieter, more calculating. If he's spent ten years planning this..."

"Then we'll spend however long it takes stopping him," Camille finished firmly. She stood up. "I won't let you fight him alone."

Victoria looked up, surprise flashing across her face.

"From the moment you found me in that parking garage, you've fought for mne,"Camille continued."You reshaped me. Gave me purpose. A new life. Everything I am now, I owe to you."

"Camille..."

"No, let me finish." Camille's voice grew stronger. "You taught me to never show weakness. To always strike first. To use every resource at my disposal." She placed her hand over Victoria's. "Well, now I'm using the most valuable resource I have, you. We fight together. We win together."

Alexander stepped closer. "She's right, Victoria. Divided, Herod and Rose can pick us off one by one.Together, they don't stand a chance."

Victoria's eyes moved between them, something shifting in her expression. Slowly, the familiar steel returned to her gaze.

"Together," she repeated, as if testing the word."It's been a long time since I trusted anyone enough to fight alongside them."

"Then it's about time you started," Camille said.

Victoria stood, smoothing her suit jacket. "They'll expect us to be defensive now. To focus on protecting the Grid. Especially after the groundbreaking."

Alexander nodded. "Which means we need to be offensive instead."

"Exactly." Victoria moved to her desk, pressing the intercom. "Sarah, get me the files on all Preston family holdings from ten years ago. And schedule a meeting with the legal team for seven AM tomorrow."

She released the button and turned back to Camille and Alexander. "If Herod's been operating under aliases,there must be a paper trail somewhere. We find his assets, we find his weaknesses."
"I have my team working through the night," Alexander said.

Camille watched them shift into strategic mode, but her mind was elsewhere.... on Rose. Rose, who had manipulated everyone since childhood. Rose, who wouldn't stop until she had destroyed everything Camille loved.

"What are you thinking?" Victoria asked.

"Rose won't be satisfied with just damaging the Grid," Camille said slowly."She wants me to suffer. To watch everything I care about burn."

She turned to face them both.

"Which means she'll target the people I love too."

Victoria's eyes widened slightly."You think she'll go after Alexander? Or me?"

"Eventually. Yes." Camille's throat tightened. "Rose has always wanted what I have. She took Stefan. She tried to take my family, my reputation, my status. Now she'll want to take..."

Alexander crossed the room in three quick strides, taking her face in his hands. "Let her try."

His touch anchored her, pushing back the wave of fear threatening to drown her. In his eyes, she saw not just affection but fierce determination.

"I'm not Stefan," he said quietly. "I won't be manipulated. I won't be turned. And I'm a lot harder to get rid of than she thinks."

Victoria watched them, then opened her desk drawer and removed something small and silver. She held it out to Camille, a pin in the shape of a knight chess piece.

"I was going to give you this after the Grid went online," Victoria said."The knight, the piece that moves differently than all the others. The piece that can leap over obstacles. The piece that's most dangerous when it's underestimated."

Camille took the pin, feeling its weight in her palm.
"Now I think you need it sooner," Victoria continued. "To remind you that sometimes the best move isn't the obvious one."

"Thank you," Camille said, pinning it beside her phoenix emblem.

Victoria straightened. "We'll need to move quickly. I want twenty-four-hour security on all of us. Full background checks on everyone working on the Grid project."

"Done," Alexander said.

"And Rose?" Camille asked.

Victoria's mouth tightened. "We need to draw her out. Force her to show her hand."

"How?"

"By giving her something she can't resist." Victoria rubbed her temples."What does Rose want more than anything?"

"Todestroy me," Camille said. "To take everything I have."

"Exactly. And right now, what's most important to you?"

"The Phoenix Grid." Camille understood immediately."We make her think we've discovered a flaw in the system. Something that could delay the launch."

Alexander nodded. "A carefully leaked internal memo suggesting security concerns. Technical problems that need addressing."

"Rose will think her sabotage was discovered," Camille continued,"buut not completely understood. She'll want to know exactly what we found, and what we missed."

"And Herod will want to adjust his timeline," Victoria added. "They'll need to communicate, to coordinate."

"Which gives us a chance to track them,"Alexander finished.

Alexander's expression remained troubled. "What about your relationship? The press is already speculating after the groundbreaking ceremony."
Victoria studied them both. "You're not ready to go public."

"No. Not yet. Not like this." Camille exchanged a glance with Alexander."What we have is too new, too personal to use as a strategic move."

"We don't want Rose targeting it specifically," Alexander added. "Better to keep it private, protected."

Victoria nodded. "I understand. Some weapons are best kept sheathed until the perfect moment. We'll find another way to draw them out."

Camille felt relief wash through her. What was growing between her and Alexander felt precious, fragile despite its strength.

"Thank you," she said softly.

Victoria's gaze sharpened. "Don't thank me yet. This fight is just beginning, and it will get much worse before it ends. Herod Preston spent a decade rebuilding from nothing. That kind of patience, that level of determination..." She shook her head. "He won't be easily defeated."

"Neither will we," Camille said firmly.

Victoria smiled then, a real smile that transformed her face. "No. We won't."

She turned to Alexander. "Have your team leak that internal memo first thing tomorrow. Make it seem accidental, an email sent to the wrong distribution list, perhaps."

"Consider it done."

Victoria moved toward the door. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to make some calls."

At the doorway, she paused, looking back at Camille. "Camille... thank you. For saying you won't let me fight alone. It's been a very long time since anyone stood with me."

Before Camille could respond, Victoria was gone.

Alexander took Camille's hand. "Are you alright?"

"NO,"she admitted. "I'm scared. Not for myself, but for her. For you."
"Hey," Alexander said gently, pulling her closer. "Remember what you told Victoria? Together. We fight together."

"Besides," he added, a hint of steelentering his voice, "Rose may think she knows you. But she has no idea who I am. What I'm capable of."

Camille caught a glimpse of something hard and dangerous beneath his usual controlled exterior.

"You've been fighting for me from the shadows all this time," she said softly. "Now we fight side by side."

"Side by side," he agreed. "No more operating separately. No more secrets between us."

His phone buzzed. He frowned at the screen.team found something. Herod has been moving large sums to offshore accounts. Recently."

"What does it mean?"

"It means he's preparing for something big." Alexander's eyes met hers."Camille, whatever's coming... it's coming soon,"

She touched the knight pinat her lapel."Then we'll be ready."

But even as she spoke the words, a whisper of doubt curled through her mind. Rose had alway/s been one step ahead. And now, with Herod Preston beside her, with resources and hatred fueling them both...
