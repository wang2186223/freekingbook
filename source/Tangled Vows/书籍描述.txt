One night. One mistake. A life unraveling.
When Tapiwa wakes beside a stranger, she flees—only to discover he’s her boyfriend’s brother, CEO Jadon Paterson. Their forgotten night ignites obsession: Asher hunts her with roses and rage, while a blackmailer dangles explicit photos over Jadon’s empire. As attempted murder crashes into their chaos, Tapiwa and Jadon must confront a burning truth: Was their passion poison... or salvation? Trapped between a brother’s vengeance and a killer’s shadow, they race to expose a plot that could destroy everything.
The deeper the secret, the deadlier the price.
